 Where there is a continuing nuisance of which the defendant knew or 
          ought to have known, reasonable remedial expenditure might be recovered 
          by the owner who had had to incur it.<a href="#aaa281" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [281] </a> The owner of a mansion block in 
          London was therefore entitled to recover damages for the cost of remedial 
          work made necessary by damage caused by the encroachment of the roots 
          of a tree on an adjoining highway before it purchased the property in 
          1990 because, although there had been no new damage after that date, 
          the highway authority had declined to remove the tree and was therefore 
          continuing the nuisance.<a href="#aaa82" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [82] </a><a href="#aaa96" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [96] </a> <br/>

          The House of Lords so held in dismissing an appeal by Westminster City 
          Council against the decision of the Court of Appeal [2000] BLR 1 to 
          allow an appeal by the second claimant owner, Flecksun Ltd, a wholly-owned 
          subsidiary of the first claimant, Delaware Mansions Ltd, a management 
          company owned by the tenants of the block, from the order of Mr Recorder 
          Derek Wood QC, sitting as an official referee, dismissing the claim 
          for damages.<a href="#aaa20" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [20] </a><a href="#aaa21" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [21] </a><a href="#aaa24" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [24] </a><a href="#aaa27" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [27] </a><a href="#aaa28" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [28] </a><a href="#aaa29" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [29] </a><a href="#aaa283" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [283] </a> <br/>

          The judge held that the remedial work had been properly and reasonably 
          incurred but that since the damage had been caused in 1989 only the 
          previous owners could sue for damages.<a href="#aaa86" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [86] </a><a href="#aaa87" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [87] </a> The Court of Appeal had allowed 
          Flecksun's appeal on the ground that since the highway authority had 
          declined to remove the tree the nuisance had continued so as to allow 
          the company to claim damages for the remedial work.<a href="#aaa88" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [88] </a> <br/>

          LORD COOKE said that there was a continuing nuisance during Flecksun's 
          ownership until at least the completion of the remedial work in 1992.<a href="#aaa94" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [94] </a><a href="#aaa243" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [243] </a> It mattered not that further cracking of the superstructure might not 
          have occurred after 1990.<a href="#aaa59" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [59] </a><a href="#aaa244" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [244] </a> The encroachment of the roots was causing 
          continuing damage to the land by dehydrating the soil and inhibiting 
          rehydration.<a href="#aaa40" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [40] </a><a href="#aaa69" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [69] </a><a href="#aaa245" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [245] </a> Damage consisting of impairment of the load-bearing qualities

          been given notice that it was causing damage and the opportunity of 
          avoiding further damage by removing the tree but had elected to preserve 
          it for environmental reasons, they might fairly be expected to bear 
          the cost of underpinning or other reasonably necessary remedial works; 
          and the party on whom the cost had fallen might recover it, even though 
          there might be elements of hitherto unsatisfied pre-proprietorship damage 
          or protection for the future.<a href="#aaa253" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [253] </a><a href="#aaa256" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [256] </a><a href="#aaa257" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [257] </a> As a general proposition tree owners were 
          entitled to notice and a reasonable opportunity of abatement before 
          liability for remedial expenditure could arise, but Westminster had 
          been given ample notice and time and was liable.<a href="#aaa258" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [258] </a><a href="#aaa259" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [259] </a><a href="#aaa270" onclick="highlightLinks(href);"> [270] </a>  <br/>
