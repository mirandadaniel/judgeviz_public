253	5	On 8 March 2001 the Court of Justice for the European Communities decided that that United Kingdom revenue law , which had since 1973 allowed companies whose parents were resident in the United Kingdom to elect to pay dividends free of advanced corporation tax -LRB- `` ACT '' -RRB- , discriminated unlawfully against companies with parents resident in other Member States : Metallgesellschaft Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioners -LRB- Joined Cases C-397 and C-410 / 98 -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- Ch .

253	7	The exaction of the tax from such companies had been contrary to the EC Treaty and they were entitled to compensation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	8	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	9	The forensic fall-out from this decision has been very considerable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	10	Large numbers of subsidiaries of companies resident in other Member States have lodged claims for compensation or restitution , some raising difficult ancillary points of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	11	The High Court has made a group litigation order to enable these points to be resolved in an orderly fashion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	12	The main point in this appeal concerns the period of limitation applicable to such claims . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	13	But that in turn raises some fundamental questions about the cause of action upon which the claimants rely . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	14	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	15	Before coming to these questions , I must briefly enlarge upon the provisions relating to advance corporation tax which the ECJ held to be contrary to Community law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	16	The tax , which was abolished in 1999 , was in theory corporation tax payable in advance of the date on which it would otherwise have been payable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	17	A company resident in the United Kingdom pays corporation tax on profits arising in a given accounting period and , generally speaking , the tax is payable nine months after the period ends . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	18	But the trigger for the payment of corporation tax was the payment of a dividend . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	19	A company which paid a dividend became liable to account to the Inland Revenue for ACT calculated as a proportion of the dividend . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	20	This could afterwards be set off against the corporation tax -LRB- `` mainstream corporation tax '' or `` MCT '' -RRB- which became chargeable on its profits . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	21	The Revenue thereby obtained early payment of the tax and , in cases in which the company 's liability for MCT turned out to be less than it had paid as ACT , payment of tax which would not otherwise have fallen due . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	22	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	23	The rule that ACT was payable on dividends was however subject to an exception if the dividend was paid to a parent company in the same group . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	24	Under section 247 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 the company and its parent could jointly make a group income election which gave them the right to be treated for the purposes of ACT as if they were the same company . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	25	No ACT would be payable on the distribution by the subsidiary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	26	It would however be payable on any distribution by the parent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	27	The Act confined the right of election to cases in which the parent was resident in the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	28	Otherwise a subsidiary which had elected would not be liable to ACT and the parent , being non-resident , would not be liable either . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	29	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	30	In the Metallgesellschaft case the Court of Justice decided that these arrangements infringed the right of establishment guaranteed by article 52 -LRB- now 43 -RRB- of the EC Treaty in that they discriminated against companies resident in other Member States . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	31	It held that the companies which had been unlawfully required to pay ACT were entitled to restitution or compensation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	32	The nature of the remedies , the procedures by which they could be enforced and matters like the appropriate limitation periods were said to be matters for domestic law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	33	The only specific qualification imposed by the Court of Justice was that English courts could not apply the rule in the The Pintada -LRB- President of India v La Pintada Compania Navigacion SA -LSB- 1985 -RSB- AC 104 -RRB- to deny any recovery of interest to a claimant whose ACT had been set off against MCT before the commencement of proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	34	The claimant was entitled to be compensated for loss of the use of the money between the date on which it was paid and the date when MCT became due . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	35	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	36	In these proceedings , commenced on 18 October 2000 , Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Group plc -LRB- `` DMG '' -RRB- claims compensation for having had to pay ACT on three dividends paid to its German parent company between 1993 and 1996 : in October 1993 , February 1995 and January 1996 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	37	-LRB- No mention of the 1995 and 1996 ACT payments appeared in the pleadings until an amendment made on 19 August 2002 and there is an issue , to which I shall return later , over whether that latter date should be taken for the purposes of limitation as the commencement date of the proceedings in respect of those dividends . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	38	All the payments were subsequently set off against MCT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	39	The facts are set out more fully in the speech to be delivered by my noble and learned friend Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe , which I have had the privilege of reading in draft . 	lord hoffmann	lord walker	NAN	0	NAN
253	40	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	41	There is no dispute that if DMG had been entitled to make a group election , it would have done so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	42	There is likewise no dispute that DMG is entitled to compensation for breach of statutory duty -LRB- the infringement of article 43 -RRB- or by way of restitution of tax unlawfully demanded under the principle established in Woolwich Equitable Building Society v Inland Revenue Commissioners -LSB- 1993 -RSB- AC 70 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	43	But the period of limitation for both of these causes of action runs from the date of payment and DMG wishes to claim in respect of the 1993 payment , which on any view was made more than six years before proceedings were commenced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	44	In addition , if the proceedings in respect of the 1995 and 1996 ACT payments are treated as having been commenced on 19 August 2002 , they would also have been more than 6 years earlier . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	45	DMG therefore argues that it has an additional cause of action for restitution on the ground that the money was paid by mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	46	Section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- of the Limitation Act 1980 provides that where the action is for `` relief from the consequences of a mistake '' , the period of limitation does not begin to run until the claimant has discovered the mistake `` or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	47	-LRB- With effect from 8 September 2003 , this provision no longer applies to mistakes of law in tax cases : see section 320 of the Finance Act 2004 . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	48	DMG says that it did not discover its mistake until the ECJ gave judgment -LRB- after the commencement of proceedings -RRB- and no amount of diligence could have enabled it to know in advance what the ECJ was going to say . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	49	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	50	The first question , therefore , is whether DMG has a cause of action which can be described as being `` for relief from the consequences of a mistake '' within the meaning of section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1980 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	51	It claims that it seeks relief against having paid money to the Inland Revenue in the mistaken belief that , since section 247 of the Taxes Act made no provision for a group election by a company with a German parent , it was obliged to pay ACT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
253	52	In fact , article 43 of the Treaty made this denial of a right of election unlawful and , in consequence , since DMG would have exercised its election , it was not obliged to pay ACT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	53	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	54	Before the decision of the House of Lords in Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln City Council -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 349 , this mistake would not have given rise to any cause of action because it was a mistake of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	55	That rule has now been abandoned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	56	Nevertheless , Mr Glick QC for the Inland Revenue submits that while it is now in general true that money paid by mistake can be recovered , whether the mistake is of fact or law , tax is different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	57	There is still no cause of action at common law for the recovery of tax paid under a mistake of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	58	He says that there are only two remedies for the recovery of tax which was not due . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	59	One is the common law remedy to recover tax unlawfully demanded which was established in the Woolwich case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	60	The other is the statutory remedy provided by section 33 of the Taxes Management Act 1973 : 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	61	Whether the claim is under the Woolwich principle or section 33 , time runs from when the payment was made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	62	So Mr Glick says that in either case , the claim for interest on the 1993 payment is statute barred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	63	The judge -LRB- Park J -RRB- rejected the submission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	64	He saw no reason in principle why the right to restitution of payments made by mistake , which had been extended in Kleinwort Benson to include mistakes of law , should not apply to payments of tax . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	65	No argument based on section 33 appears to have been advanced to him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	66	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	67	The Court of Appeal -LRB- Jonathan Parker , Rix and Buxton LJJ -RRB- disagreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	68	The main reason was their view that Lord Goff of Chieveley , in his speech in Kleinwort Benson , had said that payments of tax under a mistake of law were subject to a separate and distinct regime which provided remedies only under the Woolwich principle and section 33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	69	Buxton LJ also offered some reasons why it would cause difficulties if payment by mistake was accepted as a ground for the recovery of taxes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	70	I will come back to this point later , when I deal with the question of whether DMG did in fact pay the tax by mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	71	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	72	First , however , I must deal with the opinion attributed by the Court of Appeal to Lord Goff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	73	Both Jonathan Parker LJ and Buxton LJ subjected his speeches in the Woolwich and Kleinwort Benson case to a detailed analysis which I have read more than once with attention and respect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	74	The chief support for Mr Glick 's argument is to be found in the following passage in Kleinwort Benson -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 349 , 382 : 13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	75	There is no doubt that the regimes are different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	76	Both the Woolwich principle and section 33 apply only to the recovery of money paid as taxes or the like . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	77	They do not apply to `` private transactions '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	78	The Woolwich principle is indifferent as to whether the taxpayer paid the tax because he was mistaken or , as in Woolwich , for some other reason . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	79	And section 33 has its own rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	80	So the regime for taxes is certainly different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	81	But the question is whether Lord Goff meant to say that the remedies provided by the two regimes are mutually exclusive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	82	Woolwich and section 33 are available only for `` taxes and other similar charges '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	83	Does it follow that the common law rule for recovery of payments made by mistake , as applied to private transactions in Kleinwort Benson , does not apply to taxes ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	84	That would be going a good deal further . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	85	It is one thing to say that the regimes are different and another to say that their remedies are mutually exclusive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	86	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	87	This question is discussed at considerable length in the judgments in the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	88	It is , I think , neither here nor there for me to say that , as one who -LRB- in the end -RRB- gave wholehearted concurrence to Lord Goff 's speech , I never thought that it had the meaning attributed to it by the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	89	Once a judgment has been published , its interpretation belongs to posterity and its author and those who agreed with him at the time have no better claim to be able to declare its meaning than anyone else . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	90	But to my mind the context in which Lord Goff made the remarks which I have quoted demonstrates conclusively that he could not have meant what the Court of Appeal thought . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	91	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	92	Early in his speech -LRB- -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 349 , 367 -RRB- Lord Goff announced that he proposed to address first the question of whether the rule precluding recovery of money paid under a mistake of law should remain part of English law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	93	This had not been much discussed in argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	94	Counsel for the respondents had not attempted to defend the old rule but had concentrated his fire on the questions of whether someone who acts in accordance with a settled understanding of the law can be said to have made a mistake , or whether , if he has , the rule should be subject to an exception in such a case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	95	Nevertheless , Lord Goff devoted some space to an examination of the history and possible policies of the mistake of law rule and finally concluded -LRB- at p 375 -RRB- that it should be abrogated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	96	That part of his speech contains no hint of an exception for taxes paid under a mistake of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	97	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	98	Lord Goff then went on to the question of whether it made a difference that the payments were made in accordance with a settled understanding of the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	99	It is here that the passage which I have quoted appears . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	100	He uses the distinction between tax payments and private transactions to argue that the case for a settled law exception is stronger in the case of tax payments -LRB- `` large numbers of taxpayers may be affected '' and `` there is an element of public interest '' -RRB- than in the case of private transactions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	101	At the end of this discussion , he leaves the door slightly open for an argument that there is such a defence for tax payments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	102	But he rejects it for private payments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	103	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	104	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	105	this reasoning is quite inconsistent with the absence of a cause of action for recovery of tax on the grounds of mistake of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	106	What kind of claim did Lord Goff contemplate that a settled law defence might protect the Revenue against ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	107	Surely , a claim to recover tax on the ground that it had been paid under a mistake of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	108	Lord Goff was not suddenly turning to the Woolwich cause of action and asking whether it should be subject to a defence that the demand for tax , although ultra vires , was in accordance with a settled understanding of the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	109	The question which he had announced -LRB- at p 367 -RRB- that he intended to answer was `` whether ... there should be an exception to recovery on the ground of mistake of law ... in cases where the money has been paid under a settled understanding of the law which has subsequently been changed by judicial decision . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	110	There would be little point in discussing whether a settled understanding of the law should be a defence to a claim for recovery of a tax payment on the grounds of mistake of law if there was no such cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	111	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	112	In my opinion , Lord Goff 's speech in Kleinwort Benson does not deny the right to recover tax on the ground that it was paid by mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	113	On the contrary , his discussion of a possible settled law defence necessarily entails that he thought that there was such a cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	114	And for the reasons I gave in Kleinwort Benson , I do not think that there is an exception for cases in which there is a settled view of the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	115	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	116	Mr Glick 's alternative submission was that section 33 excluded any common law claim on the grounds of mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	117	He said that Parliament , having provided a qualified remedy for one category of mistaken payments of tax -LRB- when `` the assessment was excessive by reason of some error or mistake in a return '' -RRB- , must be taken to have dealt exhaustively with any kind of mistaken payment of tax and , so far as section 33 did not provide a remedy , must be taken to have intended that no remedy should exist . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	118	Mr Glick accepts that section 33 has no application to the present case because ACT was payable without any assessment , but nevertheless submits that section 33 excludes a remedy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	119	In my opinion this goes much too far . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	120	Mr Glick advanced a similar argument in the Woolwich case , where section 33 did not apply because there had been no lawful assessment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	121	The House of Lords rejected it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	122	It is true that in Woolwich Mr Glick 's argument was more ambitious , in that he was trying to use section 33 to exclude a remedy even when there had been no mistake of any kind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	123	But the question is in the end one of construction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	124	When a special or qualified statutory remedy is provided , it may well be inferred that Parliament intended to exclude any common law remedy which would or might have arisen on the same facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	125	That was the case in Marcic v Thames Water Utilities Ltd -LSB- 2003 -RSB- UKHL 66 ; -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 2 AC 42 , upon which Mr Glick relied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	126	But I see no reason to infer that Parliament intended to exclude a common law remedy in all cases of mistake -LRB- whether of fact or law -RRB- in which the Revenue was unjustly enriched but did not fall within section 33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	127	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	128	The next question is whether the money was paid by mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	129	This might seem at first sight to be a simple question but the division of opinion in the Kleinwort Benson case -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 349 and the academic literature show that it can lead one into deep waters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	130	One might start by asking why it matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	131	The effect of the decision in Metallgesellschaft -LSB- 2001 -RSB- Ch 620 was that the Inland Revenue had not been entitled to the money . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	132	Nor could the Revenue have thought that DMG was intending to make an interest-free loan to the British government or that there was any other proper ground on which they had been entitled to retain it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	133	Why , then , is it necessary to investigate the precise state of mind -LRB- of which the Revenue would have known nothing -RRB- with which DMG made the payment ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	134	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	135	The answer , at any rate for the moment , is that unlike civilian systems , English law has no general principle that to retain money paid without any legal basis -LRB- such as debt , gift , compromise , etc -RRB- is unjust enrichment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	136	In the Woolwich case -LSB- 1993 -RSB- AC 70 , 172 Lord Goff said that English law might have developed so as to recognise such a general principle - the condictio indebiti of civilian law - but had not done so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	137	In England , the claimant has to prove that the circumstances in which the payment was made come within one of the categories which the law recognizes as sufficient to make retention by the recipient unjust . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	138	Lord Goff provided a list in the Woolwich case at pp 164-165 and the decision itself added another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	139	One such category , long recognized , is payment by mistake : see Kelly v Solari -LRB- 1841 -RRB- 9 M & W 54 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	140	The late Professor Birks argued , in the second edition of his book on Unjust Enrichment -LRB- 2005 -RRB- , that the trend of recent English decisions meant that , for the purpose of entitling a claimant to recover , the categories were now superfluous . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	141	The fact that the money had not been due was , in the absence of some other causa for payment , a sufficient ground for recovery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	142	We have now developed a condictio indebiti . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	143	The absence of a basis for the payment is a ground which generalises and subsumes all the separate categories of situation in which a payment of money not due was recoverable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	144	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	145	I do not think it is necessary for us to decide this question about the fundamental basis of enrichment liability because the question before the House is not the fundamental juridical basis of DMG 's cause of action but whether the action can be described as being `` for relief from the consequences of a mistake '' within the meaning of section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- of the 1980 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	146	Kleinwort Benson -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 349 is recent authority for the proposition that an action for restitution of money paid under a void contract can fall within this description . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	147	That does not seem to me inconsistent with the existence of the mistake not being essential to the cause of action but merely one example of a case which falls within a more general principle , just as one could have -LRB- say , for the purposes of limitation -RRB- a category called `` clinical negligence '' without implying that it is a cause of action different in nature from other kinds of negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	148	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	149	I come back , therefore , to the question of whether DMG made a mistake , against the consequences of which the action seeks relief . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	150	The first point to make is that the alleged mistake was one of a very special kind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	151	If DMG had known for certain what the Court of Justice was going to say in Metalgesellschaft on 8 March 2001 , it is very unlikely that it would have paid ACT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	152	But it had no means of knowing that . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	153	It was only in retrospect that it became clear that the ACT could not lawfully have been exacted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
253	154	Professor Birks said that this was not a mistake at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN

253	157	in Mapping the Law -LRB- ed Burrows and Rodger -RRB- at pp 163-180 -RRB- describes the majority decision in Kleinwort Benson to treat a similar failure of prediction as a mistake as an `` emphatic endorsement ... of the declaratory theory of judicial decision-making '' and `` abstract juridical correctitude '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	158	This seems to me , with respect , to muddle two different questions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	159	One is whether judges change the law or merely declare what it has always been . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	160	The answer to this question is clear enough . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	161	To say that they never change the law is a fiction and to base any practical decision upon such a fiction would indeed be abstract juridical correctitude . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	162	But the other question is whether a judicial decision changes the law retrospectively and here the answer is equally clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	163	It does . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	164	It has the immediate practical consequence that the unsuccessful party loses , notwithstanding that , in the nature of things , the relevant events occurred before the court had changed the law : see In re Spectrum Plus Ltd -LSB- 2005 -RSB- UKHL 41 ; -LSB- 2005 -RSB- 2 AC 680 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	165	There is nothing abstract about this rule . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	166	So the main question in the Kleinwort Benson case was whether a person whose understanding of the law -LRB- however reasonable and widely shared at the time -RRB- is falsified by a subsequent decision of the courts should , for the purposes of the law of unjust enrichment , be treated as having made a mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	167	The majority view in Kleinwort Benson was that he should . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	168	The effect of the later judgment is that , contrary to his opinion at the time , the money was not owing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	169	It is therefore fair that he should recover it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	170	It may be that this involves extending the concept of a mistake to compensate for the absence of a more general condictio indebiti and perhaps it would make objectors feel better if one said that because the law was now deemed to have been different at the relevant date , he was deemed to have made a mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	171	But the reasoning is based upon practical considerations of fairness and not abstract juridical correctitude . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	172	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	173	Mr Glick , taking Kleinwort Benson at face value , accepted that the DMG made the 1993 and February 1995 payments by mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	174	But he said that the commencement of the Metallgesellschaft litigation in July 1995 must , at the very lowest , have raised a doubt in the relevant minds of DMG . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	175	There was evidence that in July 1995 DMG had discussed the implications of the Metalgesellschaft challenge and considered making a `` protective '' group election in case Metallgesellschaft won its case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	176	-LRB- Whether such an election would have done them any good is another matter : see Park J at -LSB- 2003 -RSB- 4 All ER 645 , 657 . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	177	So the Revenue say that the 1996 payment was made when a state of doubt existed and that this was not a mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	178	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	179	There is some authority for the view that a state of doubt does not amount to a mistake : see Burrows The Law of Restitution -LRB- 2nd ed 2002 -RRB- pp 139-140 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	180	In the Kleinwort Benson case -LRB- -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 349 , 410 -RRB- my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead said : 26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	181	This was a very compressed remark in the course of a discussion of other matters and I do not think that Lord Hope could have meant that a state of doubt was actually inconsistent with making a mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	182	Contestants in quiz shows may have doubts about the answer -LRB- `` it sounds like Haydn , but then it may be Mozart '' -RRB- but if they then give the wrong answer , they have made a mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	183	The real point is whether the person who made the payment took the risk that he might be wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	184	If he did , then he can not recover the money . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	185	Speaking for myself , I think that there is a parallel here with the question of whether a common mistake vitiates a contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	186	As Steyn J said in Associated Japanese Bank -LRB- International -RRB- Ltd v Credit du Nord SA -LSB- 1989 -RSB- 1 WLR 255 , 268 : 27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	187	Likewise , the circumstances in which a payment is made may show that the person who made the payment took the risk that , if the question was fully litigated , it might turn out that he did not owe the money . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	188	Payment under a compromise is an obvious example : see Brennan v Bolt Burdon -LSB- 2004 -RSB- EWCA Civ 1017 ; -LSB- 2005 -RSB- QB 303 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	189	I would not regard the fact that the person making the payment had doubts about his liability as conclusive of the question of whether he took the risk , particularly if the existence of these doubts was unknown to the receiving party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	190	It would be strange if a party whose lawyer had raised a doubt on the question but who decided nevertheless that he had better pay should be in a worse position than a party who had no doubts because he had never taken any advice , particularly if the receiving party had no idea that there was any difference in the circumstances in which the two payments had been made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	191	It would be more rational if the question of whether a party should be treated as having taken the risk depended upon the objective circumstances surrounding the payment as they could reasonably have been known to both parties , including of course the extent to which the law was known to be in doubt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	192	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	193	These thoughts may be said to support the view of Professor Birks that English law should be less concerned with whether the person who paid the money made a mistake -LRB- involving an inquiry into his subjective state of mind -RRB- than with whether there was a valid causa for the payment , such as a debt , compromise or gift , these being matters of objective inquiry into the circumstances of the payment as they would have been known to both parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	194	But they do not arise in this case because both the judge and Jonathan Parker LJ in the Court of Appeal decided on the facts that , even if a state of doubt was inconsistent with a mistake , DMG had been mistaken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	195	Mr Thomason , the Head of Taxation at DMG , gave evidence about his state of mind when it paid the ACT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	196	He said : 29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	197	Park J accepted this evidence as showing that , whether or not a state of doubt was consistent with making a mistake , DMG , in the person of Mr Thomason , was not in a state of doubt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	198	Jonathan Parker LJ agreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	199	He said -LRB- -LSB- 2006 -RSB- 2 WLR 103 , 179 , para 235 -RRB- : 30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	200	Buxton and Rix LJJ , on the other hand , doubted whether this could be reconciled with the observations of Lord Hope which I have cited above . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	201	But I do not understand why this should be so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	202	The judge attributed Mr Thomason 's state of mind to DMG and found as a fact that he was not in doubt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	203	He thought that DMG had to pay . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	204	Someone with a more sophisticated approach to the law might have had doubts - might even have thought that Metallgesellschaft had a good case and that the ECJ ruling would apply retrospectively - but not Mr Thomason . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	205	I would therefore agree with the judge and Jonathan Parker LJ that on any view of the law on this point , he made a mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	206	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	207	If DMG made a mistake about the law , when could they `` with reasonable diligence '' have discovered it ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	208	On this question it is important to bear in mind the special nature of the mistake , namely that it was deemed to have been made because of the retrospective operation of a later decision of the Court of Justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	209	The `` reasonable diligence '' proviso depends upon the true state of affairs being there to be discovered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	210	In this case , however , the true state of affairs was not discoverable until the Court of Justice pronounced its judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	211	One might make guesses or predictions , especially after the opinion of the Advocate General . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	212	This gave DMG sufficient confidence to issue proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	213	But they could not have discovered the truth because the truth did not yet exist . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	214	In my opinion , therefore , the mistake was not reasonably discoverable until after the judgment had been delivered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	215	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	216	Two footnotes on the question of mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	217	First , Park J took a rather sophisticated view of the nature of the mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	218	He said that the mistake was not about whether ACT was payable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	219	DMG had not made an election and therefore it was payable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	220	The mistake was about whether DMG should have been allowed to elect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	221	But I agree with the Court of Appeal that the mistake was about whether DMG was liable for ACT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	222	The election provisions were purely machinery , which DMG would undoubtedly have used , by which it could enforce its right to exemption from liability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	223	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	224	Secondly , Buxton LJ said that the problems about what counted as a mistake , some of which I have discussed above , showed the `` ineptitude '' of extending the law of payment under a mistake of law to payment of taxes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	225	It is true that there may be anomalies in the different limitation treatment of claimants who paid under a mistake and those who paid without a mistake but pursuant to an ultra vires demand -LRB- Woolwich -RRB- or a void contract -LRB- Kleinwort Benson -RRB- : see -LSB- 2006 -RSB- 2 WLR 103 , 190 and 192 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	226	But these anomalies flow from any recognition of payment by mistake as a cause of action and not from a distinction between payments of tax and private payments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	227	In either case , there is the possibility of alternative causes of action , with one producing more favourable treatment under the Limitation Act than the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	228	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	229	It follows that in my opinion section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- postponed the commencement of the limitation period in respect of all three ACT payments until 8 March 2001 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	230	That makes it unnecessary to decide whether the proceedings in respect of the last two payments were begun when the proceedings were issued or when they were amended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	231	I will say only that on this point I agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	232	I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of Park J. 	lord hoffmann	self	outcome	0.2	NAN

253	241	As Lord Walker points out -LRB- para 96 -RRB- , the focus of the present appeal is on limitation of actions . 	lord hope	lord walker	partagr	0.2	NAN
253	242	DMG seeks to avoid the six year time limit by taking advantage of the extended limitation period that is available in England and Wales -LRB- but not in Scotland : see the Prescription and Limitation -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1973 , section 6 and Schedule I , para 1 -LRB- b -RRB- -RRB- under section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- of the Limitation Act 1980 which provides that , where the action is for relief from the consequences of a mistake , the period of limitation shall not begin to run until the claimant has discovered the mistake or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	243	This provision no longer applies in relation to a mistake of law relating to a taxation matter under the care and management of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs : Finance Act 2004 , section 320 -LRB- read together with section 5 of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	244	That section , which applies only to actions brought on or after 8 September 2003 , was enacted in response to the judgment of Park J in this case which was given on 18 July 2003 : -LSB- 2003 -RSB- 4 All ER 645 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	245	The application of this provision to claims existing but not yet made by 8 September 2003 is being challenged under Community law : Aegis Group plc v IRC -LSB- 2005 -RSB- EWHC 1468 -LRB- Ch -RRB- ; -LSB- 2006 -RSB- STC 23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	246	It is enough , however , for the purposes of this case to say that it is not in dispute that the extended limitation period is available to DMG if the issues which are raised in this appeal are decided in its favour . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	247	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	248	The fact that the benefit of the extended period is being removed from future cases does not deprive the question whether English law recognises a restitutionary claim for tax paid under a mistake of law of all its interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	249	But the fact that the limitation period is now the same , at least for all new claims , whichever of the various available avenues for the recovery of money from the Revenue is chosen makes it unlikely that this issue will require to be revisited in cases to which it is a party .

NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	257	He observed that there was more sense in the old mistake of law rule than its more strident critics had been prepared to admit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	258	But its rejection by the common law world was not , as he said at pp 372F-373D , due to a wish to depart from the policy underlying the rule but rather to an acknowledgement , due essentially to the work of scholars , that it could best be achieved by recognising a general right of recovery subject to specific defences to cater for the fears which formerly appeared to require a blanket exclusion of recovery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	259	It was his acceptance of this general right of recovery of money paid under a mistake , whether of fact or law , that lay at the centre of the discussion that then followed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
253	260	As he put it at p 373C , a blanket rule of non-recovery , irrespective of the justice of the case , could not survive in a rubric of the law based on the principle of unjust enrichment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	261	Instead it was for the law to evolve appropriate defences which could , together with the acknowledged defence of change of position , provide protection where appropriate for recipients of money paid under a mistake of law in those cases in which justice or policy does not require them to refund the money . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	262	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	263	This then is the background against which the argument for the Revenue on this issue must be examined . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	264	On the one hand there is the proposition which lay at the heart of Lord Goff 's analysis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	265	-LRB- An indication of the immense care he took over his speech , which was so evident to those of your Lordships who had the privilege of sitting with him on that case , can be gathered from the fact that the original version of it lacked some of the section headings that appear in the revised version that was later published in the Appeal Cases : see -LSB- 1998 -RSB- 3 WLR 1095 at pp 1119G and 1121A-B ; -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 349 at pp 379F and 381B -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	266	As he put it at p 385A-B , money paid under a mistake of law is recoverable on the ground that its receipt by the defendant will , prima facie , lead to his unjust enrichment , just as receipt of money paid under a mistake of fact will do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	267	Then there is the principle recognised by Professor Peter Birks , to whom Lord Walker has so fittingly paid tribute . 	lord hope	lord walker	partagr	0.3	NAN
253	268	With characteristic simplicity he declared that , unless displaced by statute , causes of action good against private citizens are no less good against public bodies : see his essay -LRB- in the volume Essays on Restitution -LRB- 1990 -RRB- , edited by Professor P D Finn -RRB- entitled Restitution from the Executive , at p 174 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	269	That was why he acknowledged that , if in Woolwich Equitable Building Society v Inland Revenue Commissioners -LSB- 1993 -RSB- AC 70 the building society had made a mistake of fact , it would undoubtedly have entitled the society to restitution of the money paid to the Revenue in consequence of its mistake , just as it plainly would have been had the transaction been with a private citizen .

253	271	The question is whether an exception to the general rule which Lord Goff identified should now be recognised in the case of payments made under a mistake of law to the Revenue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	272	How would Lord Goff himself have reacted to it ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	273	I think that there is no doubt what his initial reaction would have been . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	274	We can see what he made of the argument that the Revenue was in a special position in the Woolwich case at pp 171-172 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	275	The Revenue had made an unlawful demand for tax but it was asserting that it was under no obligation to pay back the money . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	276	That position seemed to him , as matter of common justice , to be untenable - a position made worse by the fact that it involved the Revenue having the benefit of a massive interest-free loan as the fruit of its unlawful action : We can also see , from the way in which he dealt with the suggested defence of honest receipt in Kleinwort Benson -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 349 , pp 384-385 , how determined he was to preserve the purity and simplicity of the principle which he had described earlier : I think that Mr Rabinowitz QC for DMG was right therefore to take as the starting point for his argument the general right to recover , and then to ask on what grounds either of policy or principle the Revenue can claim that an exception should be made in its case .

253	278	I should add , before I complete this introduction , that I believe that we are in a very different field from that which Lord Rodger of Earlsferry was contemplating when in Commissioners of Customs and Excise v Barclays Bank plc -LSB- 2006 -RSB- UKHL 28 ; -LSB- 2006 -RSB- 3 WLR 1 , 19 , para 51 he reminded us of the philosopher 's advice to `` Seek simplicity and distrust it .

253	279	The proposition that money paid under a mistake is recoverable is based on the principle that , prima facie , its receipt by the defendant will lead to his unjust enrichment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	280	There is no reason to distrust a proposition based on such an elementary principle just because it is simple . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	281	Now that the common law world has recognised that there is a general right of recovery whether the mistake is of fact or law , it should be careful not to disturb its purity and its simplicity unless there is a clear basis on grounds of principle or policy for doing so .

253	286	To bring the case within the Woolwich principle by analogy they submit that , while ACT can not be said to have been an unlawful tax , the payments that were made in this case were the result of the unlawful exclusion of certain subsidiaries in section 247 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the ICTA 1988 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	287	It follows that a right to a remedy arises in respect of that unlawfulness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	288	As for the statutory remedies , they submit that there is a general principle that a common law remedy will be excluded where Parliament has enacted a statutory scheme inconsistent with the remedy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	289	That scheme is revealed by the various provisions that have been enacted which , subject to certain conditions , permit the recovery of tax paid by reason of an error or a mistake in an assessment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

253	292	Two issues of principle lie at heart of this argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	293	The first is whether the remedy in restitution that is available for payments made under a mistake recognised in Kleinwort Benson Limited v Lincoln City Council -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 349 is subject to an exception in the case of taxes paid under a mistake of law to the Revenue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	294	The second is whether , if they are not subject to any such exception , it is open to a litigant to choose whichever of two or more concurrent remedies best suits his interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	295	The argument that , where there is a statutory scheme which occupies the same ground as the common law remedy , the common law remedy must be held to be excluded by it , can not be said to raise an issue of principle as the effect of the scheme must depend on the words of the statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	296	Nevertheless it raises an issue of policy that needs to be dealt with . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	297	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	298	The submission that the restitutionary remedy for payments made under a mistake is subject to an exception in favour of the Revenue where the mistake was one of law runs into difficulty as soon as it is articulated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	299	It seeks to build in two exceptions , not just one , into the generality of the remedy that was recognised in Kleinwort Benson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	300	The first exception would involve treating payments made under a mistake of fact differently from payments made under a mistake of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	301	The second would involve treating the Revenue differently from all other public authorities which receive payments made under a mistake of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	302	If this argument were to succeed it would have a significant impact on the law 's taxonomy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

253	306	The Revenue 's argument on grounds of principle is based on a passage in Lord Goff 's speech in Kleinwort Benson which Lord Walker has referred to -LRB- para 29 -LRB- 5 -RRB- -RRB- as the debatable passage . 	lord hope	lord walker	partagr	0.3	NAN
253	307	In this passage Lord Goff drew a distinction between , on the one hand , `` payments of taxes and other similar charges and , on the other hand , payments made under ordinary private transactions '' : p 381G-H . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	308	Elaborating on this distinction at p 382B-D , he said that under our law of restitution there were now to be found `` two separate and distinct regimes '' in respect of the repayment of money paid under a mistake of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	309	These were -LRB- 1 -RRB- cases concerned with repayment of `` taxes and other similar charges '' exacted ultra vires , recoverable as of right at common law under the Woolwich principle , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- other cases , which might broadly be described as concerned with the repayment of money paid under private transactions , governed by the common law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	310	At p 382D-E he went on to say that a case might be made in favour of a principle that , in cases concerned with taxes , payments made in accordance with a prevailing practice or a settled understanding of the law should be irrecoverable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	311	46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	312	There are a number of points about this passage that have to be taken into account in assessing its significance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	313	The first is that it appears in a section of Lord Goff 's speech where , having concluded at p 375 that English law should recognise that there was a general right to recover money paid under a mistake whether of fact or law , he was considering whether it would be appropriate to develop a defence of settled understanding of the law on the lines proposed by the Law Commission as a corollary to the newly developed right of recovery : p 381B-C . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	314	He was , in effect clearing the ground for a further examination of this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	315	Cases where taxes and other similar charges exacted ultra vires were recoverable as of right under the Woolwich principle could be left on one side because there was no need in those cases to invoke a mistake of law by the payer : p 381H . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	316	The phrase `` taxes and other similar charges '' lacks the precision that would be needed if it was intended to define the extent of an exception to the general right of recovery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	317	But Lord Goff 's point was simply that there was no room in the case of an ultra vires demand for a defence that it was made on a settled understanding of the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	318	The only context in which a limit to recovery on that ground needed to be considered was where repayment of money was sought as having been paid under a mistake of law under the newly recognised common law principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	319	47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	320	In the Court of Appeal -LSB- 2006 -RSB- 2 WLR 103 , 173-174 , para 205 Jonathan Parker LJ said that the first of the two regimes which Lord Goff identified in this passage was a comprehensive and complete regime in relation to overpayments of tax made under a mistake of law , and that it was not limited to cases where the payment of tax was made pursuant to an unlawful demand - in other words that it was not limited to Woolwich cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	321	I do not think that this can be right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	322	Not only does it read far more into the passage than the words used justify . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	323	It also fails to take account of the fact that in the Woolwich case there was no error of law by the taxpayer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	324	So the House was not called upon to consider the effect of a mistake of law in that case at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	325	Lord Goff 's use of the phrase `` or other similar charges '' is perfectly intelligible if is understood as referring to the case of an ultra vires demand . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	326	All statutory charges which are the subject of an ultra vires demand fall easily within this category . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	327	It begs many questions if it was intended to identify a category that was to be excluded from the general common law right of recovery for payments made under a mistake : see , for example , Sir Jack Beatson 's comments in Chapter 9 , Unlawful Statutes and Mistake of Law , p 174 - 175 in Burrows and Rodger -LRB- Eds -RRB- , Mapping the Law -LRB- Oxford 2006 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	328	48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	329	It has to be acknowledged , of course , that at p 382C-D Lord Goff indicated that these cases were limited to private transactions , and that he repeated this point at p 382E-F when he said that the case he was dealing with was concerned with payments made under private transactions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	330	But it can , I think , be inferred that the reason for this is to be found in his reference at p 381H-382A to the various statutory provisions which regulate the repayment of overpaid tax . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	331	This is why , when he came at p 382C-D to identify the first regime more precisely , he included in it not only those cases where the payment was recoverable under the Woolwich principle but also those cases which were the subject of statutory regimes regulating recovery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	332	Here too it was unnecessary to consider a defence of common understanding , as it was open to the statutory regime which regulated recovery to deny relief where , for example , the return was made on the basis of or in accordance with prevailing practice : see , for example , the proviso to section 33 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of TMA 1970 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	333	When he was describing these two separate and distinct regimes Lord Goff did not contemplate the possibility that there was a third category : cases concerned with the repayment of money paid under a mistake of law to a public authority which was not covered by any statutory regime regulating recovery and which , although recoverable as of right on the principle in Woolwich because it had been exacted by a demand ultra vires , was also within the scope of the newly articulated common law principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	334	It is into this third category that this case falls . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	335	49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	336	I think that it is safe to assume that if he had appreciated that there was this third category Lord Goff would have treated it in the same way as the second . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	337	In other words he would have recognised that , as the common law remedy was available , the question whether a settled understanding defence should be available was relevant here too . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	338	The element of public interest which is lacking in the case of private transactions would have to be taken into account in considering whether there was room for such a defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	339	But it would have been wholly inconsistent with the general principle which he had identified for Lord Goff to conclude that there was no cause of action on the ground of unjust enrichment at common law for payments made under a mistake of law in the case of the third category just because it was also within the scope of the Woolwich principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	340	I respectfully agree with Sir Jack Beatson 's comment in his chapter on Unlawful Statutes and Mistake of Law at p 173 that , if Lord Goff had thought that the general right of recovery did not apply to payments of taxes and general charges , he would surely have said so in his discussion of that general right .

253	342	The question then is whether DMG must be denied a remedy on the ground that the payments were made under a mistake because a remedy under the Woolwich principle is available . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	343	Lord Goff treated the two categories which he identified in the debatable passage as providing separate and distinct remedies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	344	This might be taken to suggest that , if a remedy was available to DMG by analogy with the Woolwich principle , it should not be allowed to pursue a remedy on the common law ground of unjust enrichment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	345	But in his discussion at p 387 of the question whether in the context of void transactions failure of consideration should be allowed to trump mistake of law as a ground for recovery of benefits conferred in consequence of that mistake , he pointed out that an equally strong argument might perhaps be made in favour of mistake of law trumping failure of consideration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	346	The same point could be made in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	347	The Revenue argue that primacy should be given to a ground of recovery based on the Woolwich analogy because , if this is given , the six year limitation period will apply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	348	DMG , on the other hand , wishes to take the benefit of section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- of the 1980 Act , which is why it suits it to base their claim on the general right to recover money paid under a mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

253	350	There is no obvious way of deciding which of these two approaches must be adopted if only one can be allowed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

253	352	In his note on this case , Restitution in Respect of Mistakenly Paid Tax -LRB- 2005 -RRB- 121 LQR 540 , 542 , Professor Andrew Burrows said : It would indeed be odd , and I can think of no principle that could justify such a strange result . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	353	The answer to this point is to be found in an observation by Lord Goff in a case where the question was whether a contract legislated exclusively for the parties , with the result that a parallel duty of care was excluded by it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	354	He said that there is no sound basis for a rule which automatically restricts the claimant to either a tortious or a contractual remedy and that there could be no objection to his taking advantage of the remedy which was most advantageous to him : Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 2 AC 145 , 193 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	355	We are in a different field , but I think that his reasoning is just as compelling in this context : see his reference in Kleinwort Benson -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 349 , 387 at p 387 to the usual preference of English law to allow either of two alternative remedies to be available , leaving any possible conflict to be resolved by election at a late stage .

253	357	The issue here is whether DMG 's claim under the Kleinwort Benson principle is excluded on grounds of policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	358	The policy which the Revenue invoke is that , where there is a statutory regime for the recovery of payments made under a mistake , a common law claim can not exist in parallel with it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	359	The argument is that the statutory regime , of which section 33 of TMA 1970 provides the leading example , excludes recovery on the ground of mistake at common law whether the mistake is of fact or law , and whether or not the statutory regime applies to the payment that is in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	360	DMG , for its part , accepts that there can be no recovery at common law where the claim falls within the ambit of the statutory regime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
253	361	But it submits , first , that section 33 has no application to this case and , secondly , that Parliament can not be taken to have intended that restitution should be barred by the statutory regime where it does not provide a remedy because the payment was not made under an excessive assessment .

253	365	I understood him to submit that ACT fell within section 33 because it was a form of corporation tax which is charged on profits of companies and is recoverable under an assessment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

253	367	54 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	368	The problem with fitting the payment of ACT into the regime provided for by section 33 lies in the way this tax was collected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	369	The system that was laid down for its collection in para 1 of Schedule 13 to ICTA 1980 was for a return to be made for each of the company 's accounting periods of the franked payments made during that period which was to be accompanied by the amount of the ACT , if any , payable by it in respect of those payments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	370	It was not tax charged under an assessment , which is what section 33 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of TMA 1970 contemplates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	371	55 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	372	In support of his argument that , even if section 33 of TMA 1970 did not apply , Parliament had enacted a statutory scheme which was inconsistent with the common law remedy , Mr Glick relied on the judgment of your Lordships ' House in Marcic v Thames Water Utilities Ltd -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 2 AC 42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	373	I do not think that that case is in point here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	374	Mr Marcic 's claim in nuisance was held to be inconsistent with the statutory scheme . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	375	His argument was that Thames Water ought to have built new sewers to prevent flooding of his property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	376	But , as Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead pointed out , this ignored the statutory limitations on the enforcement of sewerage undertakers ' drainage obligations : para 35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	377	An important purpose of the statutory scheme was that individual householders should not be able to launch proceedings in respect of a failure to build sufficient sewers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	378	That would supplant the regulatory role of the industry 's regulator , whose role was to decide whether to make an enforcement order when questions of flooding arose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

253	380	56 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	381	For all these reasons I would hold that the general right to recover payments made under a mistake of law on the Kleinwort Benson principle extends to the payment of taxes made to the Revenue on the mistaken belief that they were due and payable , and that DMG is entitled to take advantage of section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- of the Limitation Act 1980 by basing its claim for restitution on that principle .

253	383	The availability of a cause of action under the Kleinwort Benson principle is of no help to DMG unless it can show that it made the payments of ACT under a mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	384	The Revenue maintain that it did not make the payments under any mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

253	386	58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	387	There is no doubt that the only way that a company resident in the United Kingdom could avoid liability under section 14 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of ICTA 1988 to ACT on qualifying distributions made to its shareholders was by making an election jointly with the receiving company under section 247 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act , a group income election , that section 247 -LRB- 1 -RRB- was to apply to the dividends received from the paying company . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	388	So long as a group income election was in force the election dividends , as section 247 -LRB- 1 -RRB- described them , were excluded from section 14 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	389	But if no group income election was in force ACT was due and payable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

253	391	59 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	392	But this approach overlooks the principle on which the claim for restitution that was recognised in Kleinwort Benson is founded , which is unjust enrichment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	393	As Lord Goff put it at -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 349 , 385 , it is unjust for the defendant to retain the money paid under a mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	394	The essence of the principle is that it is unjust for a person to retain a benefit which he has received at the expense of another which that person did not intend him to receive because it was made under a mistake that it was due . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	395	The claimant must prove that he acted under a mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	396	But the stage when he made his mistake does not matter , so long as it can be said that if he had known of the true state of the facts or of the law at the time of the payment he would not have made it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

253	399	Robert Goff J , as he then was , said in Barclays Bank Ltd v W J Simms Son & Cooke -LRB- Southern -RRB- Ltd -LSB- 1980 -RSB- QB 677 , 694 , after a careful review of the leading authorities about payments made under a mistake of fact , that it is sufficient to ground recovery that the claimant 's mistake should have caused him to pay the money to the payee .

253	404	He made it clear in his witness statement that the ACT was paid because the relevant provisions of ICTA 1988 required it to be paid and because he believed that the UK statute denying the ability to make a group income election was the law and that he was bound to act in accordance with it .

253	411	Park J acknowledged in para 25 of his judgment that DMG 's mistake was not directly a mistake about whether there was a liability to pay ACT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	412	As he put it , it was directly a mistake about whether group income elections could be made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	413	The liabilities to pay ACT arose as secondary consequences of that primary mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	414	In the Court of Appeal Jonathan Parker LJ said that he could not agree with this analysis and that DMG 's mistake lay not in its belief that a group election was not available but rather in its belief that the ACT was payable when , on the true state of the law , it was not : paras 231-232 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	415	I think , with respect , that Park J 's analysis was the correct way of looking at what happened in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	416	It was the mistaken belief that group relief could not be claimed that led inevitably to the liability to pay ACT which , absent a valid claim to group relief , DMG was not in a position to dispute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	417	That was where the mistake was made , of which the payment of ACT was a secondary consequence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

253	421	The mistake was , of course , a mistake of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	422	But under the Kleinwort Benson principle a cause of action at common law for their recovery is available . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	423	The discovery issue 63 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	424	The next question is when , for the purposes of section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- of the 1980 Act , DMG discovered its mistake or could with reasonable diligence have done so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	425	The Revenue submit that the relevant mistake was discovered in relation to the 1993 and 1995 ACT payments in or about July 1995 when DMG learned that the provisions of section 247 of ICTA 1988 were the subject of serious legal challenge on the basis of EC law in the Hoechst case and might not be lawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	426	They submit that the 1996 payment was not made under a mistake as , when this payment was made , DMG was aware that the provisions of section 247 were the subject of serious challenge and might not be lawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	427	64 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	428	In support of these arguments reference is made to what I said in Kleinwort Benson -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 349 about the state of mind of the payer who claims to have made a payment under a mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	429	At p 409-410 I said that cases of mistake could vary from complete ignorance to a state of ample knowledge but a misapplication of what was known to the facts - from sheer ignorance to positive but incorrect belief , as Mason CJ said in David Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia -LRB- 1992 -RRB- 175 CLR 353 , 374 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	430	But I also said that a state of doubt was different from a mistake , and that a person who pays when in doubt takes the risk that he may be wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	431	I ended this passage at p 411C-D by saying that the critical question was whether the payer would have made the payment if he had known what he is now being told was the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	432	65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	433	These propositions are capable of further refinement : see Professor McKendrick , ` Mistake of Law ' - Time for a Change , in The Limits of Restitutionary Claims : A Comparative Analysis -LRB- ed Swadling , 1997 -RRB- , pp 232-233 ; Graham Virgo , The Principles of the Law of Restitution -LRB- 1999 -RRB- , p 161 ; Professor Burrows , the Law of Restitution , 2nd ed -LRB- 2002 -RRB- , p 140 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	434	The difficult question is what degree of doubt is compatible with a mistake claim , as Professor Burrows points out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	435	I see the issue as being essentially one of causation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	436	What was the effect of the mistake on the payer ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	437	But the basic principle is , of course , that of unjust enrichment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	438	At what point can it be said that the payee has been unjustly enriched ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	439	The answer to these questions will depend on the facts of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	440	One can leave on one side cases where there is another ground on which the payee was entitled to be paid : frustra petis quod mox restiturus es . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	441	As for the rest , the payer 's reason for making the payment despite his doubt will have a part to play in resolving the issue as to whether the payer , who would not have made the payment had he known the true state of the facts or the law at the time of the payment , should bear the risk or can recover on the ground that he was mistaken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	442	66 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	443	The argument that DMG simply took the risk that it might have been wrong when it made the payments was considered and rejected by Park J . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	444	He held in para 30 of his judgment that DMG did not discover its mistake in 1995 when it learned about the argument that Hoechst was advancing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	445	It did not do so until the decision in Hoechst was released by the European Court on 8 March 2001 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	446	In the Court of Appeal Jonathan Parker LJ said in para 234 that he agreed with the judge 's conclusion on this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	447	But Rix LJ and Buxton LJ found it difficult to reconcile the judge 's conclusion that DMG was still labouring under a mistake of law with what I said in Kleinwort Benson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	448	Buxton LJ , recalling that that case was about the rights of the opposite party in a private law transaction , said in para 282 that the considerations which applied in such a case could only be applied very imperfectly to a citizen faced with an ultra vires demand . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	449	He said that persons who pay in response to a demand by the Revenue are in a quite different position from persons who pay under a private transaction , as the demand for tax is implicitly backed by the coercive powers of the state . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	450	He compared the Woolwich case , where the society was certain that the Revenue 's demand was ultra vires but paid none the less and was restricted to a claim within the six year period , with the present case where DMG claims relief because of payment under a mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	451	Although it was aware of doubts raised by other persons and of pending litigation , it paid because it thought , as it turned out incorrectly , that the law was the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	452	This result , he said , was reached through machinery developed to deal with the quite different issue that arises where a citizen makes a private law payment under a mistake that is his own mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	453	67 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	454	I recognise the force of Buxton LJ 's concern . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	455	But I see it as a criticism primarily of the uneven way the limitation rules operate , rather than of the conclusion which the judge drew in the light of the evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	456	In so far as it amounts to a suggestion that the law ought to distinguish between payments made under a mistake of law in private transactions and those made in response to a demand by a public authority made in the mistaken belief that the law under which is was made was the law , I think that the answer to it must be found in a return to first principles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	457	The fundamental point , as Lord Goff recognised in Kleinwort Benson at -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 349 , 373 , is that a blanket rule of non-recovery can not sensibly survive in a rubric of the law based on the principle of unjust enrichment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	458	The enrichment of a public authority because a payment was made to it in response to a demand in the mistaken belief that the law under which the demand was made was the law is no less unjust than an enrichment arising from a mistake of law in a private transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	459	Unevenness in the operation of the limitation rules is a matter for Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	460	68 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	461	The matter has , of course , been addressed so far as the Revenue is concerned by section 320 of the Finance Act 2004 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	462	But there are still some loose ends . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	463	As Lord Goff mentioned in his concluding remarks in Kleinwort Benson , this is a matter for consideration by the Law Commission with a view to finding a solution that can be made the subject of legislation by Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	464	As Professor Burrows has indicated , if there is perceived to be a problem , the right way forward is not to distort the common law of restitution by artificially limiting the scope of Kleinwort Benson but for the legislature to stop time running indefinitely in mistake cases : -LRB- 2005 -RRB- 121 LQR 540 , 543 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	465	I would respectfully endorse his reference in this passage to mistake cases generally . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	466	There seems to be no good reason why cases of mistake of fact , the nature of which and the occasion for the discovery of which can vary greatly , should not be treated in the same way for limitation purposes as mistakes of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	467	Relief from the general six year time limit could be given in either case where the mistake was induced by the payee 's words or conduct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
253	468	69 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	469	What then of the evidence ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	470	Mr Thomason said in his witness statement that he learned of Hoechst 's challenge to the ACT rules in around July 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	471	Whilst he monitored developments , it was not clear what the outcome would be . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	472	His position was that at all times prior to the determination of the European Court in the Hoechst case the law was to be found in the UK statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	473	In para 45 he said that , so far as he was concerned , there were no good grounds prior to the date when the European court delivered its judgment for doubting the validity of the statutory payments requiring payment of ACT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	474	In cross-examination he said that he did not feeling anything near certainty that Hoechst 's challenge would succeed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	475	70 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	476	It may be said that there was enough in Hoechst 's challenge to raise a doubt in Mr Thomason 's mind as to whether or not the law with which he was faced would survive it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	477	But the situation with which he was faced is quite different from that where a payer who is in a state of doubt about the state of the law in a private transaction decides to pay nevertheless and take the risk that he may be wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	478	In such a case the causative link between the mistake and the payment may be broken because the evidence shows that the payer was content to pay irrespective of whether the sum is due or not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	479	In this case DMG was in no position to do anything else but pay the ACT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	480	It had not claimed group income relief because , wrongly as it turned out , it believed that group income relief was not available . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	481	71 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	482	It is plain , as the judge recognised , that if DMG had submitted a claim for group income relief under section 247 -LRB- 1 -RRB- the Revenue would have pointed to the clear terms of the statute and rejected it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	483	It has never been suggested that they would have conceded in a question with DMG the point which they were resisting so strongly in their litigation with Hoechst . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	484	DMG 's mistaken belief that a group income election was not available was not shown to be wrong until the issue which Hoechst had raised was determined by the European Court on 8 March 2001 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	485	The issue , which was one of law , was not capable of being resolved except by litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN

253	487	In this situation I would hold , in agreement with Park J and Jonathan Parker LJ , that DMG was not in a state of doubt , when it paid the ACT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN

253	494	LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	495	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	496	73 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	497	This appeal is another , but assuredly not the last , of the appeals to your Lordships ' House in the litigation that has arisen as a result of the judgment of the European Court of Justice -LRB- the `` ECJ '' -RRB- , given on 8 March 2001 , in the Metallgesellschaft Ltd and Hoechst AG conjoined cases , but which I will , for convenience refer to as the `` Hoechst case '' , reported in -LSB- 2001 -RSB- Ch 620 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	498	The ECJ held , first , that it was contrary to Article 52 of the Treaty -LRB- now Article 43 EC -RRB- for the tax legislation of the United Kingdom to establish a tax regime under which group income elections -LRB- enabling dividends to be paid by UK subsidiaries to their parent companies without incurring an obligation to pay advance corporation tax -RRB- could be made only where the parent company was resident in the UK , and , accordingly , which denied the possibility of benefiting from a group income election where the parent company had its seat in another Member State . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	499	Secondly , the ECJ held that where a UK subsidiary had been obliged to pay ACT in respect of dividends paid to its parent company with a seat in another Member State , even though UK subsidiaries with parent companies resident in the UK were entitled in similar circumstances to make group income elections and thereby avoid that obligation , European law -LRB- i.e. Article 43 EC -RRB- required that the subsidiary and its non-resident parent 74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	500	The issue in this particular appeal is whether and , if so , how section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- of the Limitation Act 1980 applies to the cause -LRB- or causes -RRB- of action on which the appellant company -LRB- `` DMG '' -RRB- is suing the Revenue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	501	The factual background to DMG 's action and the manner in which the action was dealt with in the courts below is comprehensively set out in the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe . 	lord scott	lord walker	factagr	0.5	NAN

253	503	But as I have the misfortune to differ from him , and a majority of your Lordships , as to the right conclusion to be reached in this appeal I must refer to some of the background in order to explain the reasons for my dissent . 	lord scott	lord walker	fulldisa	0.5	NAN
253	504	75 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	505	In paragraph 117 of his opinion Lord Walker has helpfully summarised six issues in dispute between the parties . 	lord scott	lord walker	partagr	0.5	NAN
253	506	The issues which have led to my dissent are those Lord Walker has numbered -LRB- 2 -RRB- and -LRB- 5 -RRB- . 	lord scott	lord walker	partdisa	0.5	NAN
253	507	Issue -LRB- 2 -RRB- asks the question whether DMG made its payments of ACT under a mistake of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	508	Issue -LRB- 5 -RRB- asks whether DMG can bring its cause of action within section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- of the 1980 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	509	As to issue -LRB- 5 -RRB- I would respectfully venture an amendment to Lord Walker 's description of the issue . 	lord scott	lord walker	fulldisa	0.5	NAN
253	510	Lord Walker has suggested that issue -LRB- 5 -RRB- arises if DMG fails on issue -LRB- 1 -RRB- , that is to say , fails to satisfy your Lordships that English law recognises a restitutionary claim for tax paid under a mistake of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	511	I agree that issue -LRB- 5 -RRB- arises in that event , but it would arise also if DMG were to succeed on issue -LRB- 1 -RRB- but fail on issue -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	lord scott	lord walker	partagr	0.5	NAN
253	511	I agree that issue -LRB- 5 -RRB- arises in that event , but it would arise also if DMG were to succeed on issue -LRB- 1 -RRB- but fail on issue -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	lord scott	lord walker	partdisa	0.5	NAN
253	512	If that were to be the case DMG 's cause of action could not be a restitutionary claim for tax paid under a mistake of law -LRB- the recognition of which by English law could not therefore assist DMG -RRB- but would have to be either a compensation claim or , perhaps , a claim based upon unjust enrichment , the Revenue having obtained payment of an amount of corporation tax earlier than would have happened if the group of which DMG formed part had been able to make a group income election . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	513	Whichever way the claim were put the question would arise whether DMG 's action could be described , for section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- purposes , as an `` action for relief from the consequences of a mistake '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN

253	515	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	516	these issues , and the identification of the nature of DMG 's action against the Revenue , require , in my opinion , as an essential preliminary , a careful analysis of the ECJ judgment in order to be clear as to what it was about the UK tax regime that was ruled to be a breach of European law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	517	Park J said that But , in the Court of Appeal , Jonathan Parker LJ disagreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	518	He said , at para 231 If the Lord Justice 's analysis of the Hoechst judgment is correct , it must follow that his conclusion that DMG was under no legal obligation to pay ACT too is correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	519	The critical question is whether that conclusion is correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	520	The Hoechst judgment 77 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	521	The unlawfulness found by the ECJ in the UK 's ACT tax regime was the unjustified discrimination against corporate groups the parent companies of which were resident in Member States other than the UK . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	522	The discrimination consisted of withholding from those corporate groups the option of making group income elections and thereby avoiding the obligation of a UK resident subsidiary of paying ACT to the Revenue when paying dividends to its non-resident parent company . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	523	This discrimination was held to be incompatible with Article 52 because it would tend to discourage companies resident in other Member States from establishing subsidiaries in the UK . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	524	It thus constituted an unlawful restriction on the freedom of establishment guaranteed by Article 52 -LRB- see para 36 of the ECJ judgment -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN

253	526	The ECJ was answering two questions which had been referred to it by the Chancery Division of the High Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	527	The first was whether it was consistent with Community law The ECJ gave to this question the answer `` no '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	528	It did so because At paragraph 54 the ECJ explained that And , at paragraph 55 , that And , in paragraph 76 , the ECJ answered the first question by declaring that it was The reference by the ECJ in each cited passage to `` the possibility '' of making a group income election , a `` possibility '' that the tax regime denied to corporate groups with a non-resident parent company , identifies the element in the tax regime that the ECJ found to be inconsistent with European law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	529	The ECJ did not hold that subjecting resident subsidiaries of non-resident companies to the obligation of paying ACT was contrary to European law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	530	What was unlawful was the discriminatory nature of the group income election provisions which failed to give corporate groups with a non-resident parent company the same possibility of enabling resident subsidiaries to avoid the payment of ACT as was open to corporate groups with a resident parent company . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	531	The question is what effect this unlawful feature of the ACT tax regime should be held to have had on the obligation of subsidiaries , such as DMG , to pay ACT in respect of dividends paid to their non-resident parent companies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN

253	534	The second question for the ECJ to answer concerned remedies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN

NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	538	Community law required no more than that 80 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN

253	540	Thus : and , to the same effect , and 81 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	541	These passages show that the breach of Community law was the failure of the UK 's ACT tax regime to provide for corporate groups with a parent company resident in a Member State other than the UK the same opportunity of postponing the payment of corporation tax by making a group income election as was available to domestic corporate groups . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	542	Does it follow that section 14 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 -LRB- originally section 84 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Finance Act 1972 -RRB- , which imposed the obligation on UK companies to pay ACT in respect of dividends paid to their shareholders , was unlawful , or , to put the question another way , imposed an unlawful tax ?

253	543	In my opinion , it does not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	544	The effect of the ECJ judgment in the Hoechst case on the validity of the section 14 -LRB- 1 -RRB- charge to tax is a matter for the domestic courts of the UK . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN

253	552	The unlawfulness of the tax regime identified by the ECJ lies not with the imposition of ACT but in the discriminatory nature of the group income election provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	553	So how should the domestic law deal with that unlawfulness ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	554	It would clearly be an inappropriate response for the domestic courts to hold that the benefits afforded by the group income election provisions to domestic corporate groups were unlawful and ultra vires . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	555	Nor was that suggested by the ECJ . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	556	The simple answer is that the UK courts must provide a remedy to the non-domestic corporate groups for the failure of the statutory provisions to extend the same benefits to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	557	The ECJ made it clear that it was no concern of Community law how , as a matter of domestic law , that remedy was to be categorised provided the remedy was an adequate and sufficient one -LRB- para 96 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	558	However the remedy can not , in my opinion , be based on the premise that the payments of ACT were a response to unlawful demands or were payments of an unlawful tax or were payments that were not due . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	559	None of these premises is required to be made by the ECJ 's judgment in the Hoechst case and none should be constructed by UK domestic law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	560	83 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	561	The first issue referred to by Lord Walker , the issue to which more time was devoted by counsel than to all the other issues combined , was whether English law recognised a restitutionary claim for tax paid under a mistake of law . 	lord scott	lord walker	partagr	0.5	NAN
253	562	On this issue I am in full agreement with , and there is nothing I wish to add to , the opinions given by my noble and learned friends . 	lord scott	all	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	563	I agree that the effect of the speeches in this House in the Woolwich case -LSB- 1993 -RSB- AC 70 is that tax paid in response to an unlawful demand can be recovered by the taxpayer regardless of compulsion and regardless of whether the taxpayer made the payment in consequence of a mistake ; and I agree that the effect of the speeches in the Kleinwort Benson case -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 349 was that the rule barring a restitutionary remedy for money paid , or property transferred , under a mistake of law was overturned . 	lord scott	all	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	564	Accordingly , I agree that the answer to issue -LRB- 1 -RRB- is that English law does now recognise a restitutionary remedy for tax paid under a mistake of law . 	lord scott	all	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	565	84 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	566	But the answer to issue -LRB- 1 -RRB- does not mean that money paid , or property transferred , under a mistake of law is necessarily recoverable , just as money paid , or property transferred , under a mistake of fact is not necessarily recoverable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	567	It surely all depends on the part played by the mistake , whether of fact or law , in the sequence of events that has led to the payment or transfer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	568	If A and B enter into a contract with one another for the sale by A to B of a horse and B pays the price and takes delivery of the horse , B can not , absent some causative misrepresentation on A 's part , claim his money back , proffering the horse in return , on the ground that he was mistaken as to the horse 's breeding . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	569	The money once paid would be irrecoverable unless there were some ground for invalidating the contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	570	It can not be enough for the buyer to assert and prove that but for his mistake about the horse 's breeding he would not have entered into the contract and so would not have paid the money . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	571	In Barclays Bank Ltd v. W J Simms Son & Cooke -LRB- Southern -RRB- Ltd -LSB- 1980 -RSB- QB 677 at 695 Robert Goff J -LRB- as he then was -RRB- said that He then described three types of circumstance which might lead to the claim failing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
253	572	The first of these was that the payor intended the payee to have the money in any event , whether the believed fact was true or false . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	573	The second was that The third was that the payee had changed his position in good faith . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	574	There is , I would respectfully suggest , a fundamental difference between the first and the third of these types of circumstances on the one hand and the second of them on the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	575	The first and third involve circumstances which have had no causative effect on the payment of the money . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	576	In the first , the money would have been paid in any event and the third involves circumstances which have nothing at all to do with the reasons why the payer paid the money or with any misapprehensions under which the payer may have been labouring . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	577	Neither of these types of case invalidates Robert Goff J 's general proposition that if a mistake of fact causes a payment to be made that would not have been paid but for the mistake , the payer will have a cause of action for its recovery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	578	They are not true exceptions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	579	The second , however , does invalidate that proposition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	580	If a contract has been entered into that would not have been entered into but for a mistake , but the contract is then completed by a payment of the price for the goods or services that the payee has supplied , the payment can not be recovered unless the contract can be set aside . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	581	The proposition seems such an obviously correct one that it may seem pointless to ask why it is that it is correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	582	But I think the question does need to be asked for the answer casts , in my opinion , valuable light on the nature of the restitutionary remedy for the recovery of money paid under a mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	583	85 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	584	The reason , it seems to me , why the proposition is correct is that the mistake does not necessarily undermine the legal obligation which required the payment of the money or for the discharge of which the money was paid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	585	If the mistake does enable the contract to be set aside then , subject to a change of position defence , the money should be recoverable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	586	If the contract was void from the outset -LRB- as in the `` swaps '' cases -RRB- or had been avoided before the payment was made , the money should be recoverable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	587	But if the legal obligation under which the money was paid can not be , or has not been , invalidated , then , in my opinion , whether or not it can be shown that `` but for '' the mistake in question the money would not have been paid , a restitutionary remedy for the recovery of the money would not be available . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	588	86 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	589	This approach to the recovery of money paid under a mistake should , in my opinion , apply whether the mistake be of fact or of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	590	In the Woolwich case -LSB- 1993 -RSB- AC 70 the tax paid by the Woolwich was recoverable because it had been paid on account of a non-existent legal obligation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	591	In the Kleinwort Benson -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 349 case the payments of which recovery was sought by the bank had been paid under contracts that were void ab initio . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	592	In neither case could it have been suggested that the payments had been made with any animus donandi . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	593	87 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	594	There are , I think , some problems about voluntary payments made as gifts but that would not have been made but for some causative mistake , whether of fact or law , e.g. a gift of # 1000 by A to B where B is believed by A to be impecunious but is in fact a person of substantial wealth and where A would not have made the gift if he had known that to be so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	595	My present opinion is that unless there were some other reason , such as a misrepresentation by B , to enable the gift to be set aside , the mistake made by A would not suffice , notwithstanding that the payment had not been made pursuant to any legal obligation and that but for the mistake it would not have been made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	596	But the availability of a restitutionary remedy to recover gifts which would not have been made but for some mistake of fact or of law does not need to be pursued on this appeal and can be left for another day . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	597	88 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	598	In my opinion the important question for the purposes of this appeal is whether the payments by DMG of the ACT were made in discharge of a legal obligation to pay . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	599	Park J thought they were . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	600	Jonathan Parker LJ thought not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	601	For the reasons I have already expressed I agree with Park J . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	602	The mistake made by DMG and its parent company in Germany was in not realising that the failure of the ACT tax regime to allow the group to make a group income election was unlawful and could successfully have been challenged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	603	If the group had purported to make a group income election the Revenue would certainly have rejected it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	604	That rejection we now know , post Hoechst , would have been unlawful under Community law but even so , in my opinion , the lawfulness of section 14 -LRB- 1 -RRB- would not have been undermined . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	605	What might , perhaps , have been undermined would have been the Revenue 's ability to recover the ACT in an action against DMG since any claim for payment might have been met by an equitable set-off or cross claim based upon the Revenue 's breach of Community law in rejecting the group income election . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	606	89 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	607	In the events that actually happened DMG paid the ACT that was due under section 14 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	608	DMG and its German parent company did make a mistake of law in that they did not realise that they could successfully challenge the failure of the ACT tax regime to allow them , too , to make a group income election . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	609	It is possible to argue that this mistake of law was , in a `` but for '' sense , a cause of their payment of the ACT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	610	The argument has difficulties but even if it were right it would not , in my opinion , justify the conclusion that the ACT was paid under a mistake of law in the sense necessary for a restitutionary remedy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	611	The ACT was paid because there was a legal obligation under a valid statutory provision for the money to be paid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	612	DMG 's remedy was , in my opinion , not a restitutionary one for the re-payment of money paid that was not due , or for the repayment of money paid under a mistake , but was , and is , a claim for compensation to recover the loss caused by the breach of Community law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	613	90 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	614	Before leaving the important issue of whether , in the light of Hoechst , DMG was under a legal obligation to pay the ACT , I should record the assistance I have had from the article `` Justified Enrichment '' by Robert Stevens -LRB- 2005 -RRB- 5 OUCLJ 141 and in particular from the section entitled `` Was the Money Due '' .

253	616	DMG 's cause of action and section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- of the 1980 Act 91 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	617	It is common ground that DMG has a cause of action in tort for compensation for the loss caused by the breach of Community law found by the ECJ in the Hoechst case to be inherent in the ACT tax regime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	618	It is also common ground that for Limitation Act purposes time began to run when each payment of ACT was made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	619	The details of the payments are set out in paragraph 111 of Lord Walker 's opinion . 	lord scott	lord walker	partagr	0.6	NAN

253	621	In Phillips-Higgins v.

NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	622	It is not , in my opinion , an action for restitution based on the payment of money under a mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN

253	633	Several different statutory provisions relating to United Kingdom corporation tax -LRB- in particular , as it applies to multi-national groups or consortia of companies -RRB- have been successfully challenged , or are at present under challenge , as infringing Article 43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	634	The challenges have been so numerous that litigation is proceeding under several different group litigation orders -LRB- `` GLOs '' -RRB- made in the Chancery Division , and some appeals have already reached this House : Pirelli Cable Holding NV v Inland Revenue Commissioners -LSB- 2006 -RSB- UKHL 4 ; -LSB- 2006 -RSB- 1 WLR 400 and -LRB- as to procedural matters -RRB- Autologic Holdings plc v Inland Revenue Commissioners -LSB- 2005 -RSB- UKHL 54 ; -LSB- 2006 -RSB- 1 AC 118 .

253	637	The particular focus of the present appeal is on limitation of actions - in practical terms , the length of time during which the premature payment of advance corporation tax -LRB- `` ACT '' -RRB- by the appellant company Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Group plc -LRB- `` DMG '' -RRB- gives rise to a remedy enforceable in the national court .

253	642	The issues summarised above may appear fairly narrow and very technical , and on one possible view this appeal could be disposed of as a relatively short point of construction on section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- of the Limitation Act 1980 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	643	But it has produced some complex and sophisticated arguments from counsel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN

253	652	Corporation tax was first introduced by the Finance Act 1965 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	653	The structure of the tax was radically altered by the Finance Act 1972 with the introduction of ACT , which was in force from 1973 until its abolition -LRB- probably hastened by the oncoming wave of litigation based on Article 43 -RRB- in 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	654	From 1988 until 1999 the relevant provisions were to be found in a consolidating statute , the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 -LRB- `` ICTA '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	655	The political and economic background to these changes has been described by Professor John Tiley , Revenue Law 4th ed -LRB- 2000 -RRB- , pp 758-762 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN

253	657	When a company paid a dividend to its shareholders it was required to pay to the Revenue -LRB- within 14 days from the end of the quarter in which the dividend was paid -RRB- an amount of ACT equal -LRB- for most of the relevant period -RRB- to 25 % of the dividend -LRB- ICTA section 14 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	658	The ACT paid in this way was later set off against the company 's liability for mainstream corporation tax -LRB- `` MCT '' -RRB- if -LRB- as happened in this case -RRB- the company made sufficient taxable profits to be liable to pay at least as much MCT as it had paid ACT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	659	The payment of MCT would thus be accelerated by a period of between 8 1/2 and 17 1/2 months -LRB- depending on the timing of the dividend payment -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	660	A subsidiary company paying a dividend to its parent company could however avoid liability to pay ACT if both companies made a group income election -LRB- `` GIE '' -RRB- under ICTA section 247 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	661	The GIE had to be made at least three months in advance of payment of the dividend . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	662	This relief was however available only if both companies were for tax purposes resident in the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN

NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
253	669	The complaint was that these losses were caused by the discriminatory and unlawful character -LRB- under EU law -RRB- of the ACT regime under which GEIs were not available to these multinational groups , but would have been available if all the relevant members of the group had been United Kingdom companies .

253	678	The second question -LRB- set out in para 33 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the ECJ 's judgment -RRB- was whether EU law gave rise to a restitutionary right to claim a sum of money by way of interest , or whether the claimant was limited to an action for damages , and The rule of national law alluded to was that upheld by this House in President of India v La Pintada Compania Navigacion SA -LSB- 1985 -RSB- AC 104 , mentioned in para 12 of the opinion of the Advocate General .

253	680	The whole of the ECJ 's answer to the second question -LRB- paras 77-96 -RRB- is set out in full in the judgment of Jonathan Parker LJ -LRB- para 45 -RRB- and it is unnecessary to repeat it in full . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	681	The crucial passages -LRB- in the text as slightly edited in the Law Reports , -LSB- 2001 -RSB- Ch 620 , 663-664 -RRB- , are as follows : 106 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	682	The fifth question , though phrased in abstract terms , asked in effect whether the United Kingdom could rely on the defence that the two groups of companies did not seek to make GIE 's and -LRB- para 98 -RRB- In rejecting this argument the ECJ invoked the principle of effectiveness -LRB- para 106 -RRB- : 107 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	683	The Revenue 's position before your Lordships is to concede that the ECJ expects DMG to be entitled to a restitutionary remedy , but only -LRB- as Mr Glick QC put it -RRB- by analogy with the remedy in Woolwich -LSB- 1993 -RSB- AC 70 -LRB- and , crucially , subject to the usual 6-year limitation period -RRB- .

253	684	The Revenue contend that DMG is trying to obtain a concurrent domestic remedy in circumstances where , if the case were purely domestic , it would get nothing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	685	This is of course only a brief summary of its argument on an important point to which it will be necessary to return . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	686	The facts 108 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	687	As just noted , DMG is seeking a concurrent domestic remedy based on mistake of law , because it wishes to rely on section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- of the Limitation Act 1980 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	688	Section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- provides that -LRB- subject to immaterial exceptions -RRB- It was therefore necessary for Park J to make findings of fact relevant to this issue , and he heard oral evidence from Mr Peter Thomason , DMG 's Head of Taxation , who was cross-examined by Mr Glick . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	689	Mr Glick took your Lordships through quite a lot of his oral evidence but before coming to the judge 's findings on the issue of mistake I should record the undisputed facts about DMG , the group of which it came to form part , and the relevant payments of ATC . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN

253	692	DMG was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1986 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	693	Deutsche Bank AG -LRB- `` DBAG '' -RRB- , a well-known German bank , had acquired a 5 % stake in DMG in 1984 and in 1989 it made a successful takeover bid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	694	DBAG became the direct holder of about 14 % of the shares in DMG and the remainder -LRB- about 86 % -RRB- were held through another United Kingdom subsidiary of DBAG , DB Investments -LRB- GB -RRB- Limited -LRB- `` DBI '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	695	At first DMG continued to operate in a fairly independent way , despite the takeover , but in October 1994 DBAG decided to adopt a more integrated approach and to consolidate all its investment banking opportunities in London . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	696	But the integration was not fully achieved , as far as the tax departments were concerned , until May 1996 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN

253	703	112 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	704	The judge accepted that at the time of the ACT payments in October 1993 and February 1995 DMG -LRB- primarily in the person of Mr Thomason -RRB- knew nothing about the argument which was ultimately successful in Hoechst . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	705	But by July 1995 DMG knew about the Hoechst litigation , which received a good deal of publicity in the financial press . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	706	There was some discussion at DMG about the possibility of a ` protective GIE ' -LRB- Mr Thomason was cross-examined about this -RRB- but in fact nothing was done before a dividend was paid on 17 July 1995 -LRB- giving rise to the ACT payment in January 1996 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN

253	708	The judge 's main findings of fact on this point are set out in para 27 of his judgment : 114 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	709	The judge concluded -LRB- paras 30-31 -RRB- that all three relevant payments of ACT were made under a mistake of law and that DMG did not discover its mistake until the decision of the ECJ on 8 March 2001 , after DMG had commenced proceedings against the Revenue -LRB- it did so shortly after delivery of the opinion of Advocate General Fennelly -RRB- .

253	710	The Pleadings 115 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	711	DMG issued its claim form on 18 October 2000 , describing the claim as `` for damages for breach of European Community law '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	712	In its original particulars of claim -LRB- served on 9 February 2001 -RRB- it pleaded that ICTA sections 14 and 247 and Schedule 13 -LRB- `` the statutory provisions '' -RRB- were contrary to EU law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	713	It pleaded -LRB- paras 9 and 11 -RRB- that from time to time DMG paid dividends to DBAG and DBI -LRB- which passed them on to DBAG -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	714	Para 9 -LRB- but not para 11 in its original form -RRB- pleaded that ACT was paid in respect of these dividends `` pursuant to the unlawful statutory provisions and to unlawful demands made by the First and/or Second Defendant and further and/or alternatively under a mistake of law as to the validity of the statutory provisons '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	715	Para 11 was later amended to bring it into line with para 9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	716	By para 13 DMG claimed to be entitled to `` restitution of , and further and/or alternatively compensation for , and further and/or alternatively compensation for the loss of use of , monies paid on account of ACT pursuant to unlawful demands by the First and/or Second Defendant and/or under a mistake of law and pursuant to the statutory provisions in respect of the DBAG dividends '' -LRB- later amended to both sets of dividends -RRB- , compensation for loss of use of the monies to be calculated `` from the dates of payment until set-off against mainstream corporation tax or other repayment or utilisation '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	717	116 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	718	Paras 9 and 11 each ended with an averment that the amounts of ACT `` include , but are not limited to , payments of ACT made by the Claimant as specified in the -LSB- First or Second -RSB- Schedule hereto . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	719	Both Schedules -LRB- giving dates and amounts of ACT payments -RRB- were substantially amended on various later dates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	720	The pleading issue is whether these amendments added or substituted a new cause of action outside the category permitted by section 35 -LRB- 5 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Limitation Act 1980 -LRB- `` if the new cause of action arises out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as are already in issue on any claim previously made in the original action .

253	721	The issues 117 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	722	Before your Lordships , as in the courts below , there have been six issues in dispute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	723	Drawing on both the agreed statement of facts and issues and the competing version in para 5 of DMG 's printed case -LRB- but finding the latter rather more helpful -RRB- I would summarise them as follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	724	-LRB- 1 -RRB- The `` cause of action '' issue : does English law recognise a restitutionary claim for tax paid under a mistake of law ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	725	-LRB- 2 -RRB- The `` mistake '' issue -LRB- arising if DMG succeeds on issue -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- : did DMG make the payments of ACT under a mistake of law ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	726	-LRB- 3 -RRB- The `` discovery '' issue -LRB- arising if DMG succeeds on issues -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- -RRB- : when did DMG discover -LRB- or could with reasonable diligence have discovered -RRB- its mistake ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	727	-LRB- 4 -RRB- The `` settled law '' issue -LRB- arising if DMG succeeds on issues -LRB- 1 -RRB- to -LRB- 3 -RRB- -RRB- : does English law recognise a defence of `` settled law '' to a claim for restitution of tax paid under a mistake of law ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	728	-LRB- 5 -RRB- The `` scope of section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- '' issue -LRB- arising if DMG fails on issue -LRB- 1 -RRB- , and raised for the first time in this House -RRB- : can DMG bring itself within section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- even if mistake of law is not an essential element of its cause of action ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	729	-LRB- 6 -RRB- The `` pleading '' issue -LRB- raised by the Revenue 's cross-appeal and linked to the limitation issues -RRB- : this is the point on section 35 of the Limitation Act 1980 already identified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	730	118 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	731	It will be apparent that it may not be strictly necessary for your Lordships to resolve each of these issues in order to dispose of the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	732	But as this is a test case under the GLO , and the facts of other cases will differ , it seems desirable to consider all the issues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	733	On DMG 's printed case there is a seventh issue , the `` expiration '' issue , arising only if DMG can not rely on section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- , and if the Revenue succeeds on its cross-appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	734	This is a truly arcane point raised -LRB- but then left undecided -RRB- by Park J in paras 39 and 40 of his judgment , and not discussed at all in the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	735	Like Park J I would leave it for another day unless there is some practical need to answer it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	736	Woolwich and Kleinwort Benson 119 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	737	The speeches delivered in this House in Woolwich -LSB- 1993 -RSB- AC 70 and Kleinwort Benson -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 349 have attracted a great deal of academic interest and commentary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	738	The speeches -LRB- especially those of Lord Goff -RRB- were also subjected to very close scrutiny in the courts below . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	739	Buxton LJ warned himself -LRB- para 265 -RRB- against treating Lord Goff 's speeches as if they were statutes , but the fact is that they were in the courts below subjected to the same sort of minute examination as would be appropriate for a statutory -LRB- or even , if I may say so without disrespect , a scriptural -RRB- text . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	740	Your Lordships have been invited to undertake the same sort of exercise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	741	120 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	742	That invitation can not be wholly disregarded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	743	But before getting too caught up in the exegesis of Lord Goff 's speeches , and at the danger of stating the obvious , I would by way of preliminary make some simple observations about the issues in the two cases , and about all the speeches which were delivered -LRB- in each case there were quite full speeches from every member of the Appellate Committee , with two dissenting speeches -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	744	121 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	745	To my mind the salient points about Woolwich -LSB- 1993 -RSB- AC 70 were as follows : -LRB- 1 -RRB- It was decided in 1992 when the general rule barring recovery of money paid under a mistake of law still held the field . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	746	-LRB- 2 -RRB- In any case there was no mistake on the part of the building society , which had from the first challenged the validity of the transitional provisions in the relevant regulations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	747	It seems to have received confident professional advice and to have acted confidently on the advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	748	It paid the tax under protest , which was a reasonable thing to do since thousands of small investors might have been alarmed by the news that it was said to be in default . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	749	-LRB- 3 -RRB- The claim -LRB- as originally formulated -RRB- was for the repayment of a principal sum of almost # 57m with interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	750	After the issue of the writ the principal sum was repaid -LRB- with interest from the date of the writ -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	751	So only pre-writ interest was eventually at stake , but there had been a principal sum claimed to be due when the writ was issued . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	752	-LRB- 4 -RRB- The majority -LRB- Lord Goff , Lord Browne-Wilkinson and Lord Slynn of Hadley -RRB- upheld the simple principle that tax paid in response to an unlawful demand could be recovered , regardless of compulsion , and that this result was not ousted -LRB- or `` trumped '' -RRB- by any concurrent mistake of law -LRB- Lord Goff , at p 177 F-H , Lord Browne-Wilkinson , at p 198 C-H , agreeing with Lord Goff but not expressly mentioning mistake of law ; Lord Slynn , at pp 204 H-205 A -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	753	-LRB- 5 -RRB- The minority -LRB- Lord Keith of Kinkel and Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle -RRB- considered that there could be no recovery in the absence of compulsion or duress , and that there was no relevant distinction between payment of tax in response to a demand under an ultra vires regulation and payment in response to a demand under a misconstrued statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	754	If the statutory provisions for repayment of overpaid taxes were inadequate that was a matter for Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	755	-LRB- 6 -RRB- The case had no European element at all , though Lord Goff did refer -LRB- at p 177 C-E -RRB- to the San Giorgio case -LSB- 1983 -RSB- ECR 3593 , remarking that it would be strange if the right of the citizen to recover overpaid charges were to be more restricted under domestic law than it is under European law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	756	122 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	757	The salient points about Kleinwort Benson -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 349 were as follows : -LRB- 1 -RRB- It was not about tax but about interest rate swaps . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	758	-LRB- 2 -RRB- There were arguably concurrent restitutionary claims , that is a claim based on money paid under a void contract and -LRB- if and only if the House abrogated the long-standing bar on recovery of money paid under a mistake of law -RRB- a claim on that ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	759	-LRB- 3 -RRB- The significance of section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- of the Limitation Act 1980 was clearly recognised ; that was the whole point of the appellant bank seeking to overturn the rule barring recovery for mistake of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	760	The majority decided to overturn the rule despite explicitly acknowledging that an indefinitely extended limitation period might produce unsatisfactory results -LRB- Lord Goff at p 389 A-C ; Lord Hoffmann , at p 401 D-F ; Lord Hope of Craighead , at p 417 G-H -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	761	The minority also noted this point -LRB- Lord Browne-Wilkinson at p 359 H ; Lord Lloyd of Berwick at p 390 A -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	762	-LRB- 4 -RRB- The House divided as to whether a mistake of law included a mis-prediction of the result of litigation -LRB- in that case , of the outcome of Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council -LSB- 1992 -RSB- 2 AC 1 , decided by this House in 1991 after a challenge made in 1989 by a local authority auditor -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	763	This issue brought the House into the difficult area of the declaratory nature of judgments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	764	The majority held that mistake of law should be broadly interpreted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	765	I will not try to note all the relevant passages in their complex reasoning , but I note in particular Lord Goff at p 379 G ; Lord Hoffmann at p 400 D-E and Lord Hope at p 411 C-D . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	766	The minority held that this was unrealistic and amounted to falsification of history -LRB- Lord Browne-Wilkinson at p 358 A-B and Lord Lloyd at p 394 A -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	767	-LRB- 5 -RRB- `` Settled law '' was therefore for the minority not a defence to a prima facie restitutionary claim , but a reason why there was no claim at all -LRB- Lord Browne-Wilkinson at pp 360A-362G and Lord Lloyd at p 394 B-H -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	768	The majority discussed `` settled law '' as a defence , as had recently been proposed by the Law Commission in its Report -LRB- No 227 , 1994 -RRB- on `` Restitution : Mistakes of Law and Ultra Vires Public Authority Receipts and Payments '' -LRB- ` the 1994 report ' -RRB- para 5 .

253	779	He quoted at length what I have called the debatable passage in Lord Goff 's speech in Kleinwort Benson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
253	780	He concluded that it did not bear the meaning for which the Revenue contended , for a number of reasons -LRB- set out in para 18 of his judgment -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	781	In particular he noted that none of the other speeches in Kleinwort Benson supported the view that the payment of unlawfully exacted tax was to be an exception to the new principle permitting recovery of money paid under a mistake of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	782	125 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	783	As to the second and third issues , Park J held , after a careful analysis -LRB- paras 20-32 -RRB- , that DMG did make all three payments of ACT under a mistake of law , and that the mistake was not discovered until the decision of the ECJ in Hoechst on 8 March 2001 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

253	799	But he too concentrated on analysing the speeches of Lord Goff in Woolwich and Kleinwort Benson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	800	He saw the development of the law in Woolwich -LRB- para 270 -RRB- as `` not any deduction from or development of the existing rules of restitution '' and -LRB- para 271 -RRB- as `` a new remedy , perhaps drawing upon , but certainly not directly applying , ordinary principles of restitution .

253	801	He pointed out that in Woolwich Lord Goff contemplated -LRB- -LSB- 1993 -RSB- AC 70 , 174C-177C -RRB- that strict rules of limitation might be needed for cases of unlawfully exacted tax but that on DMG 's interpretation of his speech Lord Goff must have `` none the less looked with equanimity in the Kleinwort Benson case upon the prospect of claims in respect of such demands that , in the present case , were not raised until nine or ten years after demand made .

253	802	On the same theme the Lord Justice referred -LRB- para 283 -RRB- to the fact that `` Woolwich is restricted to a claim with a six-year limitation period because , as Lord Goff pointed out in the Kleinwort Benson case , it had made no mistake . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

253	812	it is impossible to read through the judgments -LRB- totalling almost 300 paragraphs -RRB- in the Court of Appeal without some surprise at the amount of time which the court devoted to what a single Law Lord -LRB- however eminent , and without doubt Lord Goff is pre-eminent in this field -RRB- said about mistake of law in a case -LRB- Woolwich -RRB- in which the claimant was never under a mistake -LRB- and so the mistake of law rule was not an issue -RRB- and about unlawfully exacted taxes in a case -LRB- Kleinwort Benson -RRB- which had nothing to do with tax .

253	815	These matters of principle -LRB- which have very properly been relied on and developed before your Lordships -RRB- include the following : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the constitutional principle of equality ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the need for coherence in the development of the English law of unjust enrichment ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- English law 's general readiness to permit a claimant to chose between concurrent claims ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- the consequences of treating the Woolwich principle as exhaustive and exclusive , especially as regards -LRB- i -RRB- mistake of fact -LRB- ii -RRB- limitation of actions and -LRB- iii -RRB- legal certainty of any proposed exception ; and -LRB- 5 -RRB- the European element -LRB- which was not present in either Woolwich or Kleinwort Benson -RRB- .

253	817	133 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	818	Under the rule of law , the Crown -LRB- that is the executive government in its various emanations -RRB- is in general subject to the same common law obligations as ordinary citizens . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	819	This is recognised by section 21 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 : see the observations of Vaisey J in Sebel Products Limited v Commissioners of Customs and Excise -LSB- 1949 -RSB- Ch 409 , 413 -LRB- though the notion of implied contract applied in that case must now be obsolete -RRB- .

253	820	There are exceptions to this principle but they are generally the subject of express enactment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	821	The Revenue 's case requires a non-statutory exception whose extent is both far-reaching and uncertain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

253	823	Buxton LJ saw Woolwich as a major departure in the common law , rather than as an incremental development of the English law of unjust enrichment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	824	I would respectfully disagree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	825	Woolwich was certainly a very important development but the majority saw it as a development which was within the proper province of the court , and not an exercise in exorbitant judicial legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	826	The Law Commission 's thorough examination of Woolwich in its 1994 Report -LRB- Part VI paras 6.1-6 .46 -RRB- seems to have accepted this , while noting some uncertainties as to how far the principle would extend . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	827	135 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	828	When Parliament enacts a special regime providing special rights and remedies , that regime may -LRB- but does not always -RRB- supersede and displace common law rights and remedies -LRB- or more general statutory rights and remedies -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	829	Whether it has that effect is a question of statutory construction : Marcic v Thames Water Utilities Limited -LSB- 2003 -RSB- UKHL 66 ; -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 2 AC 42 , 56-58 , paras 29-36 and Autologic Holdings plc v Inland Revenue Commissioners -LSB- 2006 -RSB- 1 AC 118 -LRB- which Mr Rabinowitz QC for DMG put forward as a procedural analogue to the present case -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	830	Where section 33 of the Taxes Management Act 1970 -LRB- `` TMA '' -RRB- applies it does no doubt displace any common law remedy for tax paid under a mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	831	But in Woolwich tax was demanded under a regulation which was void . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	832	There was therefore no valid assessment and the statutory regime was simply not engaged : see Lord Goff in Woolwich -LSB- 1993 -RSB- AC 70 , 169 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	833	Similarly , the ECJ has decided in Hoechst that the ACT regime is unlawful under EU law so far as it discriminates between national and multi-national groups of companies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	834	The Revenue accepts that neither section 33 of TMA -LRB- as it stood at the relevant time -RRB- nor any other statutory provision applies to the situation in which DMG finds itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	835	The gap in the statutory provisions can not provide the Revenue with a defence , both because of Woolwich and , in the context of EU law , because of the principle of effectiveness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	836	The appropriate remedy for DMG is , as the Revenue concedes , restitutionary in nature . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	837	It is not for the repayment of a principal sum unlawfully exacted from the taxpayer , but for its unlawful exaction before it became due . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	838	The ECJ has made it clear that the domestic court must provide an appropriate remedy , despite the principle reaffirmed by this House in President of India v La Pintada Compania Navigacion SA -LSB- 1985 -RSB- AC 104 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	839	Your Lordships heard no argument as to whether and how the Pintada principle applies to the law of unjust enrichment ; I note that in his leading speech in the case , Lord Brandon covered -LRB- at pp 115-116 -RRB- the position in terms of damages under common law , Admiralty law , equity and statute law , but did not refer to restitution or unjust enrichment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	840	136 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	841	I would leave open the question whether DMG has to rely on any special principle of EU law in order to obtain a remedy in respect of an exaction which is unlawful only in being premature . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	842	In other respects , DMG 's claim relies on ordinary domestic principles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	843	English law generally permits a claimant to chose between concurrent causes of action and concurrent remedies as best suits his interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	844	Lord Goff has been one of the most important influences in developing that approach : see especially Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Limited -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 2 AC 145 , 193-194 : 137 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	845	Lord Goff reaffirmed the same approach , in the context of unjust enrichment , in Kleinwort Benson -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 349 , 387 : The Law Commission took the same view in the 1994 Report -LRB- para 10 footnote 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	846	The claimant bank was allowed to put its case on mistake of law , rather than on payment under a void contract , precisely in order to rely on an extended limitation period under section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- of the Limitation Act 1980 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	847	None of the members of the Court of Appeal cited this passage from Lord Goff 's speech or even , so far as I can see , paid any regard to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	848	138 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	849	I have so far been considering what appear to me to be the main positive arguments in favour of allowing the appeal , and their cumulative effect appears to me to be formidable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	850	That effect is buttressed by considering some of the difficulties involved in the Revenue 's case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	851	In the first place , if the Woolwich principle is the only ground for recovery of wrongly paid tax , it would exclude not only an alternative cause of action based on mistake of law , but also one based on mistake of fact . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	852	That would involve a departure from a well-established principle from which public authorities are not excepted -LRB- see for instance Meadows v Grand Junction Waterworks Company -LRB- 1905 -RRB- 21 TLR 538 -RRB- and I can see no good reason for doing so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	853	139 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	854	I do not think that the departure can be justified simply by pointing to the possibility that the claimant may , by relying on mistake , obtain a longer limitation period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	855	Parliament has enacted that where there is an action for relief from the consequences of a mistake , time should not run so long as the mistake remains undiscovered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	856	If that is thought to be too generous in some cases , Parliament can change it -LRB- and has done so by section 320 of the Finance Act 2004 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	857	But the notion that it is right to show some indulgence to a claimant labouring under an undiscovered mistake is an entirely natural one , and it is not to my mind made unnatural simply because the claim is for unlawfully exacted tax . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	858	Taxpayers naturally assume that Parliament has got it right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	859	I am puzzled by Buxton LJ 's reference -LRB- para 283 -RRB- to the building society being with the suggestion that this was somehow unfair . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	860	In Woolwich the building society was fortunate in having expert legal advice that the relevant regulation was invalid , and the resources and determination to take on the Revenue promptly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	861	It did not need any extended limitation period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	862	Many other taxpayers would not be in the same position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	863	140 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	864	If the Woolwich principle is to be an exhaustive and exclusive regime for unlawfully exacted taxes , set apart from the general law of unjust enrichment , legal certainty would require the limits of the exception to be ascertainable with a fair degree of precision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	865	In the debatable passage in his speech in Kleinwort Benson Lord Goff referred twice to `` taxes and other similar charges , '' which is imprecise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	866	Mr Glick suggested that the similarity was to be found in the existence of a special statutory regime regulating recovery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	867	This suggested test was not fully explored in argument but it seems unlikely to be a satisfactory means of setting a clear dividing line within a spectrum which stretches from central government taxes and duties through rates , community charge , drainage rates and charges , special levies and licence fees imposed by statute on different industrial and commercial activities , and charges made by statutory undertakers -LRB- as to the last category see South of Scotland Electricity Board v British Oxygen Co Limited -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 1959 -RSB- 1 WLR 587 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	868	This point was touched on , inconclusively , by the Privy Council in Waikato Regional Airport v Attorney-General of New Zealand -LSB- 2003 -RSB- UKPC 50 at para 80 -LRB- discriminatory charges levied on New Zealand airports in respect of official biosecurity services -RRB- .

253	870	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	871	all these considerations lead me to the conclusion that the judge was right , and the Court of Appeal was wrong , in relation to the cause of action issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	872	That is not to say that I see no difficulty in reconciling this conclusion with the debatable passage in Lord Goff 's speech in Kleinwort Benson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	873	Undoubtedly that passage represented part of Lord Goff 's mature reflections on the development of the English law of unjust enrichment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	874	It is not easy to reconcile the passage with the rest of Lord Goff 's reasoning , but I think that the explanation is provided in the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope of Craighead , both of whom sat with Lord Goff in Kleinwort Benson -LRB- and whose opinions I have had the great advantage of reading in draft -RRB- . 	lord walker	lord hoffmann	ackn	0.8	NAN
253	874	It is not easy to reconcile the passage with the rest of Lord Goff 's reasoning , but I think that the explanation is provided in the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope of Craighead , both of whom sat with Lord Goff in Kleinwort Benson -LRB- and whose opinions I have had the great advantage of reading in draft -RRB- . 	lord walker	lord hope	ackn	0.8	NAN
253	875	But whatever the difficulties of the passage , there are to my mind two clear beacons in Lord Goff 's speech , one before and one after the debatable passage , which are clearer and more reliable guides . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	876	The first is his affirmation of a general right to recover money paid under a mistake of law -LRB- -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 349 , 375 -RRB- : The other passage , at p 387 , is that referring to `` the usual preference of English law to allow either of two alternative remedies '' which I have already cited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	877	142 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	878	I reach this conclusion without any heavy reliance on principles of EU law , except perhaps in relation to the Pintada principle -LRB- which I regard as uncertain in relation to the law of unjust enrichment -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	879	But the European context confirms my conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	880	The domestic court must give DMG an equivalent and effective remedy , and that would not be achieved , in my opinion , if recovery were limited so as to exclude an alternative concurrent remedy which would be available in a dispute between private citizens . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	881	The mistake issue 143 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	882	I can set out my views on this issue more briefly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	883	I agree with the judge 's conclusions , and I largely agree with his reasoning , though I respectfully think that he was rather over-analytical in his approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
253	884	I agree with the observation of Neuberger J in Nurdin & Peacock plc v D D B Ramsden & Co Ltd -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 1 WLR 1249 , 1272 : The straightforward test of causation put forward by Robert Goff J -LRB- as he then was -RRB- , after a full survey of authority , in Barclays Bank Limited v W J Simms Son & Cook -LRB- Southern -RRB- Limited -LSB- 1980 -RSB- QB 677 , has stood the test of time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	885	DMG paid the ACT because it mistakenly thought that it had to . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	886	The fact that there was a procedural requirement for a GIE does not alter the substance of its mistake , since -LRB- as Park J expressly found , para 11 -RRB- any attempt at making a GIE would undoubtedly have been rejected in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	887	144 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	888	I think the judge and Jonathan Parker LJ were correct in their views that the mistake was not discovered until the ECJ gave judgment in Hoechst -LSB- 2001 -RSB- Ch 620 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	889	Perusal of the report in that case suggests that the United Kingdom government tenaciously defended the ACT regime on every available ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	890	At no time before the judgment did the government concede that the ACT regime was -LRB- in discriminating between national and multi-national groups -RRB- contrary to EU law and unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	891	It was the judgment that first turned recognition of the possibility of a mistake into knowledge that there had indeed been a mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	892	I agree with the view of Lightman J in First Roodhill Leasing Limited v Gillingham Operating Company Limited -LRB- 5 July 2001 -RRB- para 22 that there may be cases It all depends on the facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	893	But in this case it is , in my opinion , clear that the judgment of the ECJ on 8 March 2001 was the decisive moment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	894	Settled law 145 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	895	Like the judge , I agree with the view expressed in Kleinwort Benson by my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann , that the fashioning of a settled law defence would be a legislative act and is therefore a matter for Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	896	Parliament has indeed incorporated its own version of the defence , in terms of `` the practice generally prevailing '' , in section 33 -LRB- 2A -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of TMA 1970 , re-enacting the proviso to section 33 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	897	As Lord Goff recognised in Woolwich and Kleinwort Benson , there are strong policy arguments in favour of a general common law right of recovery of wrongly exacted tax , and also strong countervailing arguments in favour of some restrictions on that right of recovery , especially as the defence of change of position could seldom , if ever , apply to wrongfully exacted tax . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	898	But the balancing of these high policy arguments is essentially a matter for the legislature . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

253	902	The rule that in order to come within section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- a mistake must be an essential ingredient of the claimant 's cause of action rests on a surprisingly uncertain basis , that is a view expressed by Pearson J in Phillips-Higgins v Harper -LSB- 1954 -RSB- 1QB 411 , 419 .

253	923	But in the preface to the first -LRB- 2003 -RRB- edition of Unjust Enrichment Birks , with characteristic intellectual courage , explained that he had changed his views in some fundamental respects -LRB- he wrote to Sir Jack Beatson that he was `` back to square one '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	924	In particular , he switched from the concept of `` unjust factors '' to the civilian concept of `` lack of basis '' -LRB- or `` lack of cause '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	925	As he said in his preface to the first edition , summarising the points on which his views had changed : 153 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	926	Birks ascribed his change of view partly to the swaps litigation , and especially to Kleinwort Benson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	927	In his own contribution , the first chapter , to Birks and Rose -LRB- Eds -RRB- , Lessons of the Swaps Litigation , -LRB- 2000 -RRB- he wrote of the decision of this House in Kleinwort Benson -LRB- p14 -RRB- , This can be contrasted with the well-known statement by Lord Goff in Woolwich -LSB- 1993 -RSB- AC 70 , 172 , The law of Scotland has , by contrast , closely followed the civilian model : see the Lord President -LRB- Rodger -RRB- in Shilliday v Smith -LSB- 1998 -RSB- SC 725 , 727-728 and generally Professor Robin Evans-Jones , Unjustified Enrichment : Vol.One , Enrichment by Deliberate Conferral : Condictio -LRB- 2003 -RRB- .

253	928	154 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	929	In explaining his changes of view Professor Birks also acknowledged the influence of Dr Sonja Meier , a lecturer in law at the University of Regensberg . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	930	Her views are accessible in English in her contributions to Lessons of the Swaps Litigation -LRB- chapter 6 , Restitution After Executed Void Contracts -RRB- and to Johnston and Zimmermann , Unjustified Enrichment : Key Issues in Comparison -LRB- 2002 -RRB- -LRB- chapter 2 , Unjust Factors and Legal Grounds -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	931	On this point English law may be at something of a crossroads -LRB- a metaphor first used , I think , by Waller LJ in Guinness Mahon & Co Ltd v Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council -LSB- 1999 -RSB- QB 215 , 233 , and since picked up by others including Dr Krebs , Restitution at the Crossroads , A Comparative Study -LRB- 2001 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	932	The choice as to the way forward which restitution scholars identify is between continuing to view unjust enrichment as depending on the presence of one or more of a variety of `` unjust factors '' and adopting the single test of `` absence of basis '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	933	155 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	934	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	935	the House is being invited -LRB- much more pressingly , it must be said , by scholars than by counsel for the parties -RRB- to make a choice at a very high level of abstraction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	936	Most scholars would take the view -LRB- though Professor Birks himself would not , I suspect , have agreed , since he regarded taxonomy as very important -RRB- that the choice is one which will rarely make much if any practical difference to the outcome of any particular case before the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	937	For several reasons I doubt whether this is the right time for your Lordships to decide whether to rebase the whole law of unjust enrichment on a highly abstract principle which -LRB- although familiar to civilians and to Scottish lawyers , and discussed in the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead in Kleinwort Benson -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 349 , pp 408-409 -RRB- would represent a distinct departure from established doctrine . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	938	156 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	939	It is of the nature of the common law to develop slowly , and attempts at dramatic simplification may turn out to have been premature and indeed mistaken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	940	As Lord Rodger of Earlsferry put it in Commissioners of Customs and Excise v Barclays Bank plc -LSB- 2006 -RSB- UKHL 28 ; -LSB- 2006 -RSB- 3 WLR 1 , 19 , para 51 : Other members of the House showed a similar disinclination to wide generalisation : see Lord Bingham of Cornhill at para 8 , Lord Hoffmann at para 36 and Lord Mance at para 83 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	941	Commissioners of Customs & Excise v Barclays Bank plc shows that more than forty years on from Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd -LSB- 1964 -RSB- AC 465 , the true foundations of the law of tortious liability for negligent mis-statement are still open to debate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	942	157 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	943	By contrast the English law of unjust enrichment has in the space of a decade seen four very important developments , all informed by the learning of Lord Goff : Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 2 AC 548 in 1991 , Woolwich -LSB- 1993 -RSB- AC 70 in 1992 , Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 669 in 1996 , and Kleinwort Benson -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2AC 349 in 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	944	The change in the views of Professor Birks is a recent development -LRB- which sadly he could not pursue further -RRB- and it has not yet been fully considered by other legal scholars . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	945	There is , it seems to me , much to be said for a period of reappraisal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	946	158 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	947	Nevertheless I would add that my tentative inclination is to welcome any tendency of the English law of unjust enrichment to align itself more closely with Scottish law , and so to civilian roots . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	948	I see attractions in the suggestion made by Professor Birks in Unjust Enrichment -LRB- 2nd edition , p. 116 , under the heading ` The Pyramid : a Limited Reconciliation ' -RRB- : I would be glad to see the law developing on those lines . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	949	The recognition of `` no basis '' as a single unifying principle would preserve what Lord Hope refers to as the purity of the principle on which unjust enrichment is founded , without in any way removing -LRB- as this case illustrates -RRB- the need for careful analysis of the content of particular `` unjust factors '' such as mistake . 	lord walker	lord hope	partagr	0.9	NAN

253	951	LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	952	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	953	159 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	954	DMG 's claim in these proceedings -LRB- issued on 18 October 2000 -RRB- is for compensation in respect of three payments of ACT made respectively on 14 October 1993 , 15 February 1995 and 14 January 1996 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	955	These payments could and would have been avoided had the UK tax regime not breached article 43 -LRB- formerly 52 -RRB- of the EU Treaty by denying DMG -LRB- as a multinational rather than exclusively UK group -RRB- the right to make a group income election . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	956	So much , the majority of your Lordships would hold , was established by the ECJ 's decision in Hoechst on 8 March 2001 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	957	The claim is not for the capital sums paid : those were subsequently set off against the company 's liability for MCT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	958	Rather it is for compensation for the loss of use of the monies prior to such setoffs , i.e. for having made accelerated payments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	959	160 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	960	The Revenue do not dispute DMG 's entitlement to such compensation in principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	961	On the contrary , they readily accept that the company has a perfectly good remedy , either in tort for breach of statutory duty or in restitution by analogy with the principle established in Woolwich -- see Woolwich Equitable Buildings Society v Inland Revenue Commissioners -LSB- 1993 -RSB- AC 70 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	962	But under these causes of action DMG would be confined to a six year limitation period -LRB- i.e. six years from the date of the respective payments -RRB- and on this basis would fail in respect of the October 1993 payment -LRB- and fail too in respect of the later payments were the Revenue to succeed in their cross appeal on the pleading issue , contending as they do that such claims were only brought by later amendment rather than when the writ was first issued -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	963	That is why DMG assert their claim as one for restitution based on a mistake of law -- precisely so as to benefit from section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- of the Limitation Act 1980 , just as the claimants succeeded in doing in the landmark case of Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln City Council -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 349 .

253	965	All this is fully and lucidly explained in the speech of my noble and learned friend , Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe , as too are the various issues which arise for decision on the appeal . 	lord brown	lord walker	partagr	0.9	NAN
253	966	With almost all of Lord Walker 's speech -LRB- and the speeches of my noble and learned friends , Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope of Craighead -RRB- I find myself in full agreement and , in common with them , I too would allow DMG 's appeal and restore Park J 's order . 	lord brown	lord walker	fullagr	0.9	NAN

253	967	On one issue , however , the `` discovery '' issue -LRB- linked in one respect , as it is , with the `` mistake '' issue -RRB- , I have the misfortune to take a different view , indeed a view which puts me in a minority of one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	968	As it happens , because of the inter-relationship of this issue with other issues arising on the appeal , my disagreement has in fact no effect whatsoever on the overall outcome of the proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	969	But it would not , I think , be right to ignore it entirely : the point could well be of decisive importance in other actions , perhaps indeed actions awaiting the outcome of this very appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	970	Let me explain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	971	162 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	972	As I understand it , your Lordships have concluded , first , that DMG was acting under a mistake of law when making the three relevant payments of ACT -LRB- it is on this issue that my noble and learned friend , Lord Scott of Foscote dissents on the basis that DMG was in any event under a legal obligation to make the payments and so should not be regarded within the Kleinwort Benson principle as having made them under a mistake of law -RRB- ; and , secondly , that that mistake was not discovered until the decision of the ECJ in the Hoechst case was handed down on 8 March 2001 . 	lord brown	lord scott	partagr	0.9	NAN
253	973	The contrary view which I take is that DMG ceased to be acting under any relevant mistake of law in July 1995 when they first became aware of the Hoechst proceedings and recognised that there was a serious legal challenge to the legality of the UK 's ACT regime under EC law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	974	If I am correct in this view it would follow that DMG , although paying the October 1993 and February 1995 payments under a mistake of law , discovered that mistake in July 1995 so as to set time running in respect of those particular payments as from that date ; and that the January 1996 payment was not made under a mistake of law at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	975	-LRB- It is because , however , as already stated , the claim was issued on 18 October 2000 , within six years of July 1995 , and because DMG have the benefit of undisputed alternative grounds of claim in respect of the January 1996 payment , that none of this matters given your Lordships ' rejection , with which I agree , of the Revenue 's cross appeal . -RRB- 	lord brown	all	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	976	163 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	977	Let me turn then to this narrow though potentially important issue upon which I diffidently disagree with your Lordships . 	lord brown	all	fulldisa	0.9	NAN
253	978	First I should for convenience set out again section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1980 Act : 164 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	979	It is , I acknowledge , difficult to articulate the precise touchstone by which to determine whether a payment ought properly to be held to have been made under a mistake of law -LRB- or , indeed , answering essentially the same question from a different standpoint , whether such a mistake should be held to have been discovered -- or able with reasonable diligence to have been discovered -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	980	Section 32 itself affords little help on the question -- unsurprisingly , perhaps , given that the provision -LRB- based as it was on section 26 of the Limitation Act 1939 -RRB- was framed at a time when no plaintiff could have hoped to pray in aid a mistake of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	981	165 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	982	For my part , however , I would hold that as soon as a paying party recognises that a worthwhile claim arises that he should not after all have made the payment and accordingly is entitled to recover it -LRB- or , as here , to compensation for the loss of its use -RRB- , he has `` discovered '' the mistake within the meaning of section 32 ; and , by the same token , I would hold that if he makes any further payments thereafter , they are not to be regarded as payments made under a mistake of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	983	166 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	984	Where , I would respectfully ask , is there any injustice in this ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	985	No one is suggesting , let me repeat , that the monies are not recoverable or that the payee should remain unjustly enriched . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	986	All that is required is that the payer does not sit upon what ex-hypothesi he recognises to be a worthwhile legal argument for more than six years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	987	Provided he acts within that -LRB- surely ample -RRB- time , he can pursue his claim -LRB- whether in respect of past payments or , indeed , payments he may choose to continue making -RRB- under whatever may be the appropriate cause of action : restitution for mistake of law in respect of past payments made when he had no reason to question his liability to make them , total failure of consideration , or a claim based on the Woolwich principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
253	988	167 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	989	Once a plaintiff recognises that he has a worthwhile case on the facts to pursue a claim in fraud or to extend the limitation period for a particular claim because of the defendant 's deliberate concealment of a fact relevant to his cause of action , time surely then starts to run against him under section 32 : he could not successfully argue that time starts running only when the court eventually comes to reject the defendant 's denial of wrongdoing and to find fraud -LRB- or , as the case may be , deliberate concealment -RRB- established . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	990	168 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	991	Nor do I find it easy to reconcile the approach taken by your Lordships with other provisions of the 1980 Act , most notably section 14A -LRB- 9 -RRB- : `` Knowledge that any acts or omissions did or did not , as a matter of law , involve negligence is irrelevant for the purposes of subsection -LRB- 5 -RRB- above . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	992	-LRB- Section 14A -LRB- 5 -RRB- determines the starting date for reckoning the period of limitation based on the claimant 's date of knowledge . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	993	As Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead recently observed in Haward v Fawcetts -LSB- 2006 -RSB- 1 WLR 682 , 686F , para 12 : `` A claimant need not know he has a worthwhile cause of action . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	994	On your Lordships ' view , however , such a claimant could well argue that he was labouring under a mistake of law so as to extend time under section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	995	169 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	996	Woolwich was decided on the explicit basis that the building society was in no way mistaken when making its payments under the disputed regulations -- see particularly the speech of Lord Goff at p 173D and that of Lord Slynn at p 201A-B . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	997	Rather the payments were made because , as Lord Goff put it at p 171G-H : I can see no real distinction between that case and this -LRB- this case , that is , after July 1995 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	998	True , as Lord Goff observed -LRB- at p 171G -RRB- , Woolwich was ` convinced that the demand -LSB- was -RSB- unlawful ' whereas here Mr Thomason , DMG 's Head of Taxation , believed that the company was in law bound to make the payments -LRB- precisely , indeed , as Lord Scott would hold to be so -RRB- . 	lord brown	lord scott	partagr	1	NAN
253	999	But I fail to see why the question whether monies are paid under a mistake of law should turn on the degree of conviction or optimism which the parties hold upon the legal issue dividing them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1000	Were the claimants in Hoechst -LRB- who issued their proceedings against the Revenue in 1995 -RRB- nonetheless to be regarded as having made all subsequent payments under a mistake of law ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1001	Surely not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1002	Even DMG itself , it will have been noted , brought its claim in October 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1003	Is it nevertheless to be said that their original mistake remained undiscovered until the ECJ 's actual decision in Hoechst some five months later ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1004	170 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1005	In Kleinwort Benson , as I understand that case , nothing turned upon the particular state of mind of the payer as to whether the payments for which restitution was sought were made under a mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1006	As Lord Hope noted -LRB- at p 403G -RRB- , the only issue on that part of the case was whether the bank 's mistake was one of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1007	It was certainly not critical to the decision there that the mistake of law was assumed , at least by Lord Lloyd , to have been discovered only when the House of Lords finally held in Hazell v Hammersmith & Fulham LBC -LSB- 1992 -RSB- 2 AC 1 that the swap agreements were void . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1008	As Lord Hoffmann observed -LRB- at p 401F-H -RRB- , the decision -LRB- in Kleinwort Benson -RRB- `` leaves open what may be difficult evidential questions over whether a person making a payment has made a mistake or not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1009	... There is room for a spectrum of states of mind between genuine belief in validity , founding a claim based on mistake , and a clear acceptance of the risk that they are not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1010	But these questions are not presently before your Lordships . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1011	171 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1012	Lord Hope too left open for another day cases where payments are made in a state of doubt about the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1013	The Revenue on the present appeal understandably place some reliance on what Lord Hope said at p 410B-C : 172 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1014	On the present appeal , however , Lord Hope concludes his judgment on `` the discovery issue '' -LRB- paragraphs 63-71 of his speech -RRB- with the view that , when DMG paid the ACT , '' -LSB- i -RSB- t was not then obvious that the payments might not be due . '' 	lord brown	lord hope	partagr	1	NAN
253	1015	I confess to some difficulty with that conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1016	Surely , when DMG learned in July 1995 that there was a serious legal challenge to the legality of the ACT regime , it must then have been obvious to them that these payments might not after all be due . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1017	Of course they could not be sure and of course nothing short of a final judgment from the ECJ would have persuaded the Revenue to accept any claim by DMG here for group income relief . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1018	But it does not seem to me to follow that DMG paid under a mistake of law -- any more than Woolwich would be regarded as having paid under such a mistake simply because the Revenue in that case were insisting on the validity of the contested regulations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1019	173 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1020	I have the same difficulty with paragraph 144 of Lord Walker 's opinion . 	lord brown	lord walker	partdisa	1	NAN
253	1021	Again , I see no good reason why the Revenue 's tenacious defence of their position and their refusal to concede its unlawfulness means that DMG 's mistake must be treated as undiscovered prior to the Hoechst judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1022	The passage quoted by Lord Walker from Lightman J 's judgment in First Roodhill Leasing Ltd v Gillingham Operating Company Ltd -LRB- 5 July 2001 -RRB- para 22 , continues : 174 . 	lord brown	lord walker	partdisa	1	NAN
253	1023	To much the same effect is Maurice Kay LJ 's judgment in Brennan v Bolt Burdon -LSB- 2004 -RSB- EWCA Civ 1017 ; -LSB- 2005 -RSB- QB 303 , 315 : 175 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1024	Lord Hoffmann suggests -LRB- at paragraph 26 -RRB- that : `` The real point is whether the person who made the payment took the risk that he might be wrong . 	lord brown	lord walker	partdisa	1	NAN
253	1025	If he did , then he can not recover the money . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1026	But my thesis is not that , if someone pays money knowing that he may not be under any liability to do so , he can not recover it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1027	Rather it is that he can not recover it as money paid under a mistake of law so as to benefit from the longer limitation period available under section 32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1028	Certainly he can recover the money provided only that he sues in time and has some other cause of action , such as total failure of consideration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1029	Clearly the quiz contestant who , in doubt whether Haydn or Mozart wrote the eine kleine nachtmusik answers Haydn , made a mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1030	Suppose , however , that , making that mistake , he had paid out money legally due only if Haydn had been the correct answer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1031	To my mind he , no less than the quiz contestant , took the risk that he might be wrong : he could not recover his payment as money paid under a mistake of law -LRB- or fact -RRB- although , provided he sued within six years , he could well recover it on another basis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1032	176 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1033	The precise point at which a party may be said to be , or to cease being , under a mistake of law is , I acknowledge , by no means easy to formulate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1034	Just when a party comes to recognise he has `` a worthwhile claim '' -LRB- the touchstone I have suggested in paragraph 163 above -RRB- will not always be obvious . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1035	Essentially , however , I am in broad agreement with Lightman J 's and Maurice Kay LJ 's approach in the cases mentioned above , as indeed I am with the views of the majority of the Court of Appeal on this issue in the present case -- see Rix LJ 's judgment at para 262 and Buxton LJ 's judgment at paras 281-283 .

253	1036	177 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
253	1037	For the reason already given , however , even if that view were shared by a majority of this Committee , it would avail the Revenue nothing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
