226	18	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	19	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	20	The issues The Harrow Hotel is a family business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	21	It consists of some converted houses in the Pinner Road , a section of the main A404 road from central London to Harrow . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	22	A short distance south of the hotel , the road crosses the Metropolitan Line by Roxborough Bridge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	23	Between 1989 and 1994 the London Borough of Harrow -LRB- `` the Council '' -RRB- carried out improvements to the bridge and its approaches . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	24	The work was done under statutory powers which incorporated the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	25	Although a compulsory purchase order was confirmed in 1986 , none of the land belonging to the hotel was taken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	26	The owners of the hotel -LRB- `` the claimants '' -RRB- say that during the period of the works they were subjected to various forms of interference with their use and enjoyment of the hotel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	27	Hoardings were erected which obscured the hotel and prevented or restricted access by themselves and their customers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	28	For long periods the roads and pavements leading to the hotel were totally or partially obstructed or closed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	29	The works caused continual noise , dust and vibration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	30	All this was very detrimental to business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	31	The claimants say that in the absence of statutory protection , they would have had an action for public and private nuisance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	32	Therefore their land was `` injuriously affected by the execution of the works '' so as to entitle them to compensation under section 10 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- If any person claims compensation in respect of any land , or any interest in land , which has been taken for or injuriously affected by the execution of the works , and for which the acquiring authority have not made satisfaction under the provisions of this Act , or of the special Act , any dispute arising in relation to the compensation shall be referred to and determined by the Lands Tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	33	-LRB- 2 -RRB- This section shall be construed as affording in all cases a right to compensation for injurious affection to land which is the same as the right which section 68 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 has been construed as affording in cases where the amount claimed exceeds fifty pounds . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	34	The question of compensation was referred to the Lands Tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	35	After service of pleadings the parties agreed that the Tribunal should decide certain preliminary points of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	36	The tribunal member -LRB- Judge Rich Q.C. -RRB- gave a decision and then , at the request of the claimants , stated a case for the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	37	The questions formulated for the court -LRB- as amended by consent in the Court of Appeal -RRB- were as follows : `` 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	38	Whether the Lands Tribunal erred in law in deciding that compensation is not payable under section 10 of the Act of 1965 where an interference to some legal right , public or private , is not a direct physical interference to land or a right appurtenant to land . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	39	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	40	Whether the Lands Tribunal erred in law in deciding that where there has been interference with some legal right , public or private , which is capable of giving rise to a claim for compensation under section 10 of the Act of 1965 , the quantum of damages recoverable as compensation does not include all injurious affection attributable to and caused by the execution of the works whether or not caused by an interference , physical or otherwise , with some public or private legal right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	41	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	42	Whether the Lands Tribunal erred in law in holding that compensation is payable under section 10 of the Act of 1965 where the interference with a legal right in respect of land or an interest in land is only temporary and where after such temporary interference the value of the land or the interest in the land has ceased to be affected at the valuation date . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	43	The Court of Appeal , by a majority -LRB- Peter Gibson and Pill L.JJ ; Ward L.J. dissenting -RRB- -LSB- 1999 -RSB- Q.B. 634 said that the tribunal 's answer to question 1 was right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	44	No compensation was recoverable for the noise , dust or vibrations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
226	45	Such matters did not constitute `` direct physical interference '' with land or an interest in land . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	46	The same majority disagreed with the answer to question 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	47	In their view , no compensation was recoverable for temporary interference which was no longer reflected in depreciation in capital value at the valuation date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	48	On question 2 the tribunal was unanimously affirmed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	49	Compensation was payable only for damage which , in the absence of statutory powers , would have been actionable at common law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	50	Thus all three questions were decided adversely to the claimants , who appeal to your Lordships ' House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	51	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	52	Basic principles Section 10 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1965 is a modernised version of section 68 of the Land Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	53	Subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- , which says that subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- shall be construed as affording a right to compensation `` which is the same '' as that which section 68 had been construed to provide , is an unusual provision which suggests some anxiety on the part of the legislature to discourage the courts from taking a fresh look at the statutory language . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	54	As Lord Wilberforce pointed out in Argyle Motors -LRB- Birkenhead -RRB- Ltd. v. Birkenhead Corporation -LSB- 1975 -RSB- A.C. 99 , 129 , the effect which had been given to section 68 was not always easy to justify on normal rules of statutory construction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	55	For example , in Hammersmith and City Railway Co. v. Brand -LRB- 1869 -RRB- L.R. 4 H.L. 171 , 217-218 Lord Cairns observed that section 68 : `` does not define the conditions under which the person whose land has been injuriously affected is to be entitled to compensation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	56	It rather assumes that the right to compensation has been given in some other enactments , and it contents itself with pointing out the manner in which that compensation shall be obtained . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	57	Nevertheless , despite its procedural appearance , the courts treated section 68 as creating a substantive right to compensation on principles which were worked out in a series of cases without reference to other enactments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	58	These principles were established after much travail and section 10 -LRB- 2 -RRB- shows that whatever their logic or merits , Parliament did not want them re-examined . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	59	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	60	I shall start by stating certain principles which are settled by decisions of high authority and were not as such in dispute before your Lordships , although there was argument over their application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	61	-LRB- 1 -RRB- Despite the reference in section 68 of the Act of 1845 -LRB- and now in section 10 of the Act of 1965 -RRB- to land being `` taken , '' the section gives a right to compensation to anyone whose land , or interest in land , has been injuriously affected by the execution of the works . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	62	It is not necessary that any of his land should have been taken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	63	If land has been taken , the compensation for injurious affection of his remaining land is calculated on different principles under section 7 of the Act of 1965 -LRB- formerly section 63 of the Act of 1845 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	64	-LRB- 2 -RRB- The term `` injuriously affected '' connotes `` injuria , '' that is to say , damage which would have been wrongful but for the protection afforded by statutory powers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	65	In In re Penny and South Eastern Railway Co. . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	66	-LRB- 1857 -RRB- 7 E. & B. 660-669 Lord Campbell said : `` unless the particular injury would have been actionable before the company had acquired their statutory powers it is not an injury for which compensation can be claimed . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	67	In practice this means that a claimant has to show that but for the statute he would have had an action for damages for public or private nuisance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	68	As a general proposition this again is not in dispute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	69	But a public nuisance , such as an interference with the use of a public highway , is a wrong to the public as a whole and the ordinary common law remedy was a prosecution on indictment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	70	To support an action for damages , the plaintiff has to prove that he suffered particular damage greater than that suffered by members of the public in general . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	71	This rule offers considerable scope for dispute on the facts and some of the decisions on injurious affection reflect different judicial views on what amounts to particular damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	72	-LRB- 3 -RRB- A corollary of the last principle is that no compensation is payable under section 10 of the Act of 1965 if the company or statutory authority acted outside its powers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	73	It was again Lord Campbell , this time in Imperial Gas Light and Coke Co. v. Broadbent -LRB- 1859 -RRB- 7 H.L.Cas . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	74	600 , 612 , who made this point : `` it has been determined over and over again , in every court in Westminster Hall , that under -LSB- section 68 -RSB- there is no ground for seeking compensation except for that which is done under the powers conferred by the legislature . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
226	75	If there is wrong which is not authorised by those powers , the common law right of action exist for it '' -LRB- 4 -RRB- Compensation is payable only for damage to the plaintiff 's land or interest in land . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	76	He is not entitled to any compensation for loss caused to him in a personal capacity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	77	This rule also provides scope for a great deal of argument about whether , for example , interference with the utility of the land for the purpose of carrying on a business is damage to the land or a personal loss by the proprietor of the business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	78	On this point the authorities also reveal divergent opinions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	79	-LRB- 5 -RRB- Section 68 gave compensation for injurious affection caused by the `` execution '' of the works . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	80	In Hammersmith and City Railway Co. v. Brand , L.R. 4 H.L. 171 the House of Lords -LRB- with Lord Cairns dissenting -RRB- decided that this meant that there could be compensation only for the effects of the construction of the railway and not for its operation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	81	If an embankment unreasonably obstructed the claimant 's light or access , he could claim compensation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	82	But he could not claim for what would otherwise have been a nuisance caused by the noise , vibrations or smell of passing trains . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	83	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	84	Conflicting policies and conflicting decisions The construction of the railways , which gave rise to most of the 19th century cases on injurious affection , involved massive changes in the urban and rural landscape of the United Kingdom and the disruption of the lives and businesses of very large numbers of people . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	85	It is not surprising that strong views were held about the respective claims of the winners and losers in this revolution and the judicial decisions often reveal the opinions of individual judges on questions of economic and social policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	86	Some were in favour of full compensation for all whose property had been adversely affected by the railway and others thought that the public interest required that liability should be kept within narrow bounds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	87	Lords Bramwell and Westbury fell into the first category and Lords Cranworth and Chelmsford and Erle C.J. into the second . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	88	I cite two characteristic examples , one on each side . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	89	Giving the leading judgment in the Exchequer Chamber in Hammersmith and City Railway Co. v. Brand , -LRB- 1867 -RRB- L.R. 2 Q.B. 223 , 230-231 Baron Bramwell said : `` By the ordinary working of a railway line . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	90	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	91	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	92	a nuisance was created to the occupiers of the plaintiff 's premises , which would have been actionable at common law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	93	As presumably this nuisance will continue , the premises are permanently depreciated in value to sell , let , or occupy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	94	It seems impossible that it can have been enacted that this damage can be done without any compensation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	95	It is said that the railway and the working of it are for the public benefit , and therefore the damage must be done and be uncompensated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	96	Admitting the damage must be done for the public benefit , that is no reason why no compensation should be given . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	97	It is to be remembered that that compensation comes from the public which gets the benefit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	98	It comes from those who do the damage , but ultimately from the public in the fares they pay . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	99	If the fares will not pay for this damage , and a fair profit on the companies ' capital , the speculation is a losing one , as all the gain does not pay all the loss and leave a fair profit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	100	Either , therefore , the railway ought not to be made , or the damage may well be paid for . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	101	In modern economic terms , Baron Bramwell thought that the railways should not create externalities ; that is , costs involuntarily borne by other people which were not taken into account in assessing the profitability of the enterprise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	102	The contrary view is exemplified by Erle C.J. in Ricket v. Metropolitan Railway Co. -LRB- 1865 -RRB- 5 B. & S. 149 , 163-164 , 169-170 : `` The public has a valuable interest in and derives much advantage from the works of public companies ; the capital invested in them is , therefore , protected within certain limits , and we are to see that those limits are not exceeded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	103	-LSB- E -RSB- xpediency seems strongly on the side of the view that we take , namely that companies which the legislature has sanctioned on account of their public convenience should be relieved within certain limits from liability to action as well as to indictment in respect of their works . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	104	Judges who took this view tended to rely upon a floodgates argument : unless the right to compensation was rigidly confined , everyone whose economic interests had been damaged by the construction of the railways would be entitled to compensation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
226	105	Post houses and coaching inns were favourite examples . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	106	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	107	I mention these ancient controversies not only because they still have some resonance today but also because they are an aid to the understanding of the old cases to which your Lordships were referred in the course of the argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	108	The 19th century authorities on this subject do not display a steady development of the law but the shifting ascendancies of one view or the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	109	For example , Mr. Mole Q.C. for the council particularly relied upon passages in the judgments of Lord Chelmsford and Lord Cranworth in Ricket v. Metropolitan Railway Co. -LRB- 1867 -RRB- L.R. 2 H.L. 175 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	110	This case , in which the House of Lords by a majority of two to one -LRB- Lord Westbury dissenting -RRB- deprived the landlord of the `` Pickled Egg '' in Clerkenwell of the # 100 compensation which a jury had awarded him for loss of trade caused by street closures and diversions during the construction of the Metropolitan Railway , was thought at the time to lay down narrow and artificial limits on the compensation which could be claimed for anything other than actual physical damage to the premises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	111	Two years later the advocates of a restrictive approach had an even greater success when the House of Lords in Hammersmith and City Railway Co. v. Brand , L.R. 4 H.L. 171 decided by a majority of two to one -LRB- Lords Chelmsford and Colonsay ; Lord Cairns dissenting -RRB- that no compensation whatever was payable to persons whose interests in land were damaged by the actual operation of the railway . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	112	This case made it apparent that the arbitrary rules stated by , for example , Lord Cranworth in Ricket , were not necessary to keep the floodgates shut . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	113	The construction of the railways would have caused no loss to post houses or coaching inns if the trains had not run . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	114	So after Brand the cases on injurious affection caused by the construction of the works returned to more logical principles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	115	Ricket v. Metropolitan Railway Co. , L.R. 2 H.L. 175 was explained and distinguished in later cases in your Lordships ' House until it became very difficult to say for what proposition , if any , it remained authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	116	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	117	with this introduction I turn to the three issues which were before the Court of Appeal and are now before your Lordships . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	118	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	119	The first issue : noise , dust and vibration The first question as formulated in the case stated was whether the Lands Tribunal erred in law in deciding that compensation was not payable where `` an interference to some legal right , public or private , is not a direct physical interference to land . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	120	In the Court of Appeal , Pill L.J. -LSB- 1999 -RSB- Q.B. 634 , 648 rightly commented that this formulation was not the most illuminating way of defining the issue between the parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	121	To some extent it begged the question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	122	The real issue was whether the claim for damage caused by noise , dust , vibration and the like could be the subject of compensation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	123	The term `` direct interference , '' as used in the question , was intended to mean the same as `` material injury to the property '' in the distinction which Lord Westbury L.C. drew in St. Helen 's Smelting Co. v. Tipping -LRB- 1865 -RRB- 11 H.L.Cas . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	124	642 , 650 : '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	125	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	126	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	127	it is a very desirable thing to mark the difference between an action brought for a nuisance upon the ground that the alleged nuisance produces material injury to the property , and an action brought for a nuisance on the ground that the thing alleged to be a nuisance is productive of sensible personal discomfort . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	128	Lord Westbury 's purpose in marking the difference was to distinguish between those cases in which a landowner might have to accept interference with his amenities in the interests of reasonable give and take between neighbours in the district in which he lived and those cases in which the damage was unacceptable anywhere . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	129	Mr. Mole said that no compensation was payable under section 10 of the Act of 1965 for damage which was not `` material injury to the property '' in this sense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	130	He said that Lord Cranworth -LRB- who was a party to the decision in the St. Helen 's Smelting Co. case -RRB- had in mind the same distinction when he said two years later in Ricket v. Metropolitan Railway Co. , L.R. 2 H.L. 175 , 198 : `` The injury must be actual injury to the land itself , as by loosening the foundation of buildings on it , obstructing its light , or its drains , making it inaccessible by lowering or raising the ground immediately in front of it , or by some such physical deterioration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	131	Any other construction of the clause would open the door to claims of so wide and indefinite a character as could not have been in the contemplation of the legislature . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	132	This , said Mr. Mole , excluded the effect of noise , dust or vibrations which did not cause damage to the structure of the hotel but affected the comfort of the people who used it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	133	He said that this might be an arbitrary rule but Lord Wilberforce had said in Argyle Motors -LRB- Birkenhead -RRB- Ltd. v. Birkenhead Corporation -LSB- 1975 -RSB- A.C. 99 , 129-130 that the old law was not altogether logical . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	134	Nevertheless , it had to be taken as it was : `` the most powerful considerations of policy would need to be present before so strong a current of authority could be turned back . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
226	135	Lord Cranworth 's dictum was said in the context of a case involving obstruction of the public highways giving access to the premises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	136	I doubt whether he had the St. Helen 's Smelting Co. v. Tipping dichotomy in mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	137	In any case , the dictum can no longer be regarded as authoritative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	138	It was overtaken by the decision of the House of Lords in Metropolitan Board of Works v. McCarthy -LRB- 1874 -RRB- L.R. 7 H.L. 243 , in which compensation was awarded to the owner of a warehouse near Blackfriars because the construction of the Victoria Embankment cut off his access across the public highway to a dock on the river .

226	139	In the later case of Caledonian Railway Co. v. Walker 's Trustees -LRB- 1882 -RRB- 7 App . Cas . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	140	259 , 296 , in which compensation was awarded for the closing of an access to a main street in Glasgow at some distance from the premises , Lord Blackburn said that if Lord Cranworth 's dictum was still law , the case would have to be decided differently . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	141	But in his opinion it was not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	142	Mr. Mole also relied upon a formulation of the rule by Mr. Thesiger Q.C. -LRB- afterwards Thesiger L.J. -RRB- as counsel in Metropolitan Board of Works v. McCarthy -LRB- 1874 -RRB- L.R. 7 H.L. 243 , which was adopted by their Lordships . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	143	As quoted by Lord Cairns L.C. at p. 253 , Mr. Thesiger said : `` Where by the construction of works there is a physical interference with any right , public or private , which the owners or occupiers of property are by law entitled to make use of , in connection with such property , and which right gives an additional market value to such property , apart from the uses to which any particular owner or occupier might put it , there is a title to compensation , if , by reason of such interference , the property , as a property , is lessened in value . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	144	Mr. Mole said that the words `` physical interference '' show that the House , in adopting this formula , intended to exclude matters like noise , dust and vibrations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	145	But I do not think that they had the present point in mind at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	146	They were concerned only with the principle on which compensation could be claimed for interference with `` any right , public or private , which the owners or occupiers of the property are by law entitled to make use of , '' that is , rights appurtenant to the property , such as public or private rights of way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	147	The House was not concerned with damage to the property itself , whether physical or otherwise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	148	This is plain from the report of Mr. Thesiger 's argument , at p. 249 , in which he explained what he meant by `` physical interference . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	149	`` The word ` physical ' is here used in order to distinguish the case from cases of that class where the interference is not of a physical , but rather of a mental , nature , or of an inferential kind , such as those of a road rendered less agreeable or convenient , or a view interfered with , or the profits of a trade , by the creation of a new highway or street , diminished in the old one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	150	And in like manner the words ' a right , public or private , which the owner of property is entitled to make use of , ' apply to this case and distinguish it from such cases as Hammersmith Railway Co. v. Brand . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	151	There no right , public or private , was interfered with , and the claim for compensation was made in respect of the injury to the enjoyment of the property '' The Brand case was of course very much concerned with damage to the property itself by vibrations , noise and smells . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	152	So the last sentence makes it clear that he was not concerned with injury of that kind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	153	Mr. Thesiger wanted to emphasise that although the works had been completed , he was complaining of their physical presence across the former public highway and not their operation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	154	As for the comment of Lord Wilberforce in Argyle Motors -LRB- Birkenhead -RRB- Ltd. v. Birkenhead Corporation -LSB- 1975 -RSB- A.C. 99 , 129-130 , which I have quoted , I do not think it has any application to the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	155	He was addressing the rule that injurious affection is an injury to land and not to the profits of a trade carried on upon the land . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	156	This , he said , was established by authority and -LRB- despite the powerful contrary arguments of Lord Westbury in Ricket v. Metropolitan Railway Co. , L.R. 2 H.L. 175 -RRB- could not no be questioned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	157	In these proceedings , the principle is not in dispute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	158	I shall return to its application in connection with the third question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	159	In the Court of Appeal , Peter Gibson and Pill L.JJ . accepted Mr. Mole 's submission that the concept of injurious affection to land had been so narrowly construed in the 19th century cases as to exclude injury caused by matters which cause `` sensible personal discomfort '' to the occupants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	160	This conclusion was very much reinforced by the opinion of the same judges on question 3 , namely that temporary injury is also excluded from compensation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	161	Injury caused by noise and so forth in the course of construction will almost by definition be temporary and injury caused in the same way by the operation of the road , railway or other work will be excluded by the rule in Hammersmith and City Railway Co. v. Brand , L.R. 4 H.L. 171 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	162	So the conclusions of the majority were entirely consistent with each other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	163	Conversely , Ward L.J. disagreed on both points . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
226	164	For reasons which I shall explain when I come to question 3 , I agree with Ward L.J. that temporary damage is not excluded from compensation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	165	So that can not be a reason for excluding damage caused by noise , vibrations and so forth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	166	And for the reasons which I have given , I do not think that it is excluded by the construction given to section 68 in the Victorian cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	167	I agree with Ward L.J. that damage to the amenity of land caused by nuisances involving personal discomfort , having the effect of reducing the value of the land to let or to sell , is damage to the land just as much as physical injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	168	So much was accepted by this House in Hammersmith and City Railway Co. v. Brand , L.R. 4 H.L. 171 , when the claim was for a reduction in the value of the land by the noise and pollution of the trains . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	169	The House accepted that the claimant had suffered damage to his land but held that the statute made no provision for compensation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	170	If , therefore , compensation can not be recovered for damage caused by noise , dust and vibrations , it is not because it does not constitute damage for the purposes of section 68 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	171	It is nevertheless a remarkable fact that there is no case in which such damage has been held to be the subject of compensation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	172	The only reference in the cases to the possibility of recovery is a brief dictum of Lord Campbell in In re Penny and South Eastern Railway Co. , 7 E. & B. 660 , where he said obiter that compensation could be awarded for damage caused by vibrations during the execution of the works but -LRB- anticipating Hammersmith and City Railway Co. v. Brand , L.R. 4 H.L. 171 -RRB- not by the operation of the railway afterwards . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	173	Why is there so little authority ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	174	It is not , as I have said , because such damage is in principle excluded from compensation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	175	Nor is it because the construction phase of the railways seldom caused such nuisances to neighbouring properties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	176	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	177	in my opinion the reason is to be found in the interaction of three of the basic principles of compensation to which I have drawn your Lordships ' attention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	178	In the first place , claims are restricted to damage caused by the construction of the works . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	179	Secondly , the damage must have been caused by the lawful exercise of statutory powers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	180	And thirdly , the damage must have such that in the absence of statutory protection it would have been actionable at common law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	181	In my view it will be almost impossible for any claim for damage caused by noise , dust or vibrations to satisfy all three of these rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	182	Being things `` productive of sensible personal discomfort '' within the meaning of Lord Westbury 's dichotomy in St. Helen 's Smelting Co. v. Tipping , 11 H.L.Cas . 642 , 650 , the claim is subject to the principle that a reasonable use of land , with due regard to the interests of neighbours , is not actionable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	183	The implications for building operations were spelled out by Sir Wilfred Greene M.R. in Andreae v. Selfridge & Co. Ltd. -LSB- 1938 -RSB- Ch . 1 , 5-6 : `` when one is dealing with temporary operations , such as demolition and re-building , everybody has to put up with a certain amount of discomfort , because operations of that kind can not be carried on at all without a certain amount of noise and a certain amount of dust . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	184	Therefore , the rule with regard to interference must be read subject to this qualification , and there can be no dispute about it , that in respect of operations of this character , such as demolition and building , if they are reasonably carried on and all proper and reasonable steps are taken to ensure that no undue inconvenience is caused to neighbours , whether from noise , dust , or other reasons , the neighbours must put up with it . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	185	Actionability at common law therefore depends upon showing that the building works were conducted without reasonable consideration for the neighbours . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	186	On the other hand , immunity from liability arising out of the construction of works authorised by statute is subject to a condition that the undertaker will `` carry out the work and conduct the operation with all reasonable regard and care for the interests of other persons '' -LRB- per Lord Wilberforce in Allen v. Gulf Oil Refining Ltd. -LSB- 1981 -RSB- A.C. 1001 , 1011 . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	187	Mr. Mole said that there was no daylight between these two rules : the damage was either not actionable at common law or else outside the protection of the statute : in either case it was not compensatable under section 10 of the Act of 1965 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	188	If the landowner wishes to recover for such damage , he must assume and discharge the burden of proving in an ordinary action for nuisance that the undertaker exceeded his statutory powers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	189	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	190	I am reluctant to say that no claim for dust , noise or vibration can escape this dilemma because one can not foresee all cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	191	But the argument seems to me very compelling and I would normally expect it to apply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	192	I can see no answer to it in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	193	I therefore agree that question 1 was correctly answered by the Lands Tribunal in the negative , although I do so for the reasons succinctly stated by the tribunal rather than for those given by the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
226	194	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	195	The second issue : claims for non-actionable loss The second issue is an attempt by the claimants to escape from the dilemma I have just described . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	196	Again , the issue does not emerge with great clarity from the language of the question stated to the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	197	As explained by Mr. Harper Q.C. for the claimants , the argument is that when a claimant has suffered injurious affection from the construction of road works which , in the absence of statutory powers , would have been a public nuisance , he can recover for all damage caused by the construction of the works , whether or not it would have been independently actionable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	198	The principle in Andreae v. Selfridge & Co. Ltd. -LSB- 1938 -RSB- Ch . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	199	1 does not protect the council from liability to pay compensation for noise and dust caused by the construction of the roads , even if it took all reasonable care . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	200	The Court of Appeal unanimously rejected this submission and so do I . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	201	The public nuisance which would otherwise be created by the council 's interference with the highways required statutory authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	202	But the council , as owners of the soil of the highway , was in other respects entitled to carry on works there in the same way as any other landowner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	203	The question of whether noise and dust created by those works was an actionable nuisance must depend upon the same considerations as would apply to any other works undertaken by a landowner upon his land . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	204	The fact that they would have been an actionable public nuisance because they interfered with passage on the highway does not create a parasitic claim to compensation for damage which has nothing to do with passage on the highway . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	205	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	206	Third issue : temporary damage The third issue is whether temporary damage to the value of the land is excluded from compensation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	207	Under this heading , the council wishes to exclude all compensation for the effect of the interference with access to the hotel during the construction of the works . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	208	It has been agreed that the `` valuation date '' for the assessment of any damage to the capital value of the hotel is the date when the works were completed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	209	The council wishes to confine the claim for compensation to whatever loss can be proved under this head . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	210	This form of damage , which would at common law have been a public nuisance , is not subject to the rule of give and take applicable to nuisances which cause sensible personal discomfort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	211	If the landowner can not carry on the works without causing an obstruction of the highway which would amount to a public nuisance , he can not without statutory authority carry them out at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	212	It is the statute in such a case which legitimates the public nuisance and gives rise to a claim for compensation under section 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	213	As I have said , the majority in the Court of Appeal accepted the council 's argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	214	They did so for two reasons : first , on authority , and secondly , as something which followed inevitably from the principles upon which compensatable loss was measured . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	215	The question of whether damage was temporary can arise in a number of contexts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	216	In the first place , a temporary obstruction of the highway -LRB- such as leaving a skip in the road for a few days -RRB- may not be a sufficiently serious interference with the public 's right of passage to amount to a public nuisance at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	217	This was the principle relied upon by the court in Herring v. Metropolitan Board of Works -LRB- 1865 -RRB- 19 C.B. -LRB- N.S. -RRB- 510 to hold that compensation was not payable for obstruction caused by temporary hoardings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	218	In Lingké v. Christchurch Corporation -LSB- 1912 -RSB- 3 K.B. 595 the Court of Appeal thought that the court in Herring was probably too generous to the defendants on the facts but the principle is not in doubt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	219	The time for which an obstruction has existed can also be relevant to whether the plaintiff can show that he has suffered special damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	220	Or it may affect the question of whether the damage is to the plaintiff personally or to his land . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	221	The latter was the basis upon which it was held that the level crossing -LRB- which was shut only when trains were passing -RRB- caused only personal inconvenience to the house owner in Caledonian Railway Co. v. Ogilvy -LRB- 1856 -RRB- 2 Macq . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	222	229 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	223	In Metropolitan Board of Works v. McCarthy , L.R. 7 H.L. 243 , 254 , Lord Cairns L.C. mentioned the temporary nature of the obstruction in Ricket as a reason why the plaintiff 's loss was damage to the trade without being damage to the value of the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
226	224	It may be that neither case would have been decided the same way on the facts after Caledonian Railway Co. v. Walker 's Trustees , 7 App . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	225	Cas . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	226	259 but in principle there is no reason why the temporary nature of the damage should not be relevant on both these issues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	227	But none of these questions arises in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	228	The question here is whether particular damage to the claimant 's land , which would have been actionable in the absence of statutory immunity , should be denied compensation because it is temporary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	229	Your Lordships have been referred to no authority for such a proposition before Ricket v. Metropolitan Railway Co. , L.R. 2 H.L. 175 , where the distinction between damage caused by the temporary and the permanent works of the undertaking is relied upon only by Lord Chelmsford . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	230	It will be noticed that Lord Chelmsford was concerned not so much with whether the damage was temporary but whether it had been caused by the temporary works involved in constructing the railway , such as street hoardings and excavations for tunnels which are afterwards covered over , rather than by the permanent works such as the lines , embankments and buildings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	231	But no doubt in practice the damage caused by the temporary works was likely to be temporary , as it was in Ricket 's case itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	232	Lord Chelmsford took the view that damage caused by the temporary works did not fall within section 68 of the Act of 1845 -LRB- or section 6 of the Railways Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 , which was also relied upon -RRB- because they applied only to damage caused by the `` execution of the works '' and this meant the works when executed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	233	It did not apply to damage caused in the course of execution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	234	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	235	I do not find this construction very convincing and I think it is not surprising that it did not appeal to Lord Selborne L.C. in Caledonian Railway Co. v. Walker 's Trustees , 7 App . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	236	Cas . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	237	259 or to any other judge who has considered the subject . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	238	It was rejected by all members of the Court of Appeal in Ford v. Metropolitan and Metropolitan District Railway Cos. -LRB- 1886 -RRB- 17 Q.B.D. 12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	239	The claimant was a tea merchant in Great Tower Street in the City . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	240	He had a lease for seven years from March 1880 of 3 rooms at the back of the building . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	241	The construction of the railway involved pulling down the front of the building and interfering with the access to the street while the works were in progress . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	242	When they were completed , access was restored . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	243	An arbitrator awarded him # 600 for injurious affection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	244	In the Court of Appeal counsel for the railway company took the point -LRB- as far as one can see , for the first time in reply -RRB- that `` temporary damage can not be the subject of compensation '' and cited Ricket 's case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	245	Lord Esher M.R. , at p. 20 , rejected the submission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	246	He said it was based upon Lord Chelmsford 's speech , but he thought that he had probably been misreported . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	247	Cotton L.J. said that the interference with the access materially affected the value of the rooms and therefore fell within the principle formulated by Thesiger Q.C. in Metropolitan Board of Works v. McCarthy , L.R. 7 H.L. 243 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	248	As for the exclusion of temporary damage , he said that it would be : `` to take a very narrow view of this Act , to say that compensation for injury caused by the exercise of the powers vested in the company is to be confined to injury caused by the works when constructed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	249	In my opinion the right to compensation ought to include also injury caused to the house , not only by the works when finished , but by the exercise of the powers of the Act in the course of putting up those works : 17 Q.B.D. 12 , 24 '' Bowen L.J. , at p. 28 , said likewise that temporary damage was not excluded : `` It is urged that the injury which was caused to the house by the taking away of the enjoyment of this hall , was an injury caused only during the progress of the works , and therefore was not such an injury as was intended to be compensated by section 6 of the Railways Clauses Act , which provides for compensation being given for an injury done to lands by the construction of a railway . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	250	But the question seems to me rather to be what is the character of the injury inflicted , than what is the period during which it occurs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	251	I can not help thinking that on the plain reading of the Act of Parliament an injury may be done to houses and land , -LRB- if it is an injury sufficient to lessen the value of the property , -RRB- quite as fully during the progress of work , as by the works after they have been constructed . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	252	25 years later , in Lingké v. Christchurch Corporation -LSB- 1912 -RSB- 3 K.B. 595 , 607 , Fletcher Moulton L.J. summed up the development of the law as follows : `` It is quite true that in the long line of decisions -LRB- not consistent with one another in all cases -RRB- there was a time when it was thought that there was a fundamental difference between damage caused by temporary interference with property and the user of it and permanent interference . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	253	But since the case of Ford v. Metropolitan and Metropolitan District Ry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
226	254	Cos. , which was decided in this court in 1886 , it has been settled law that the fact that an interference is only temporary and that it takes place during the construction of the works is not fatal to the right to compensation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	255	Where the interference would give ground for compensation if perpetual , then if it is temporary , but not for a negligible time , it will also give ground for compensation . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	256	In the Court of Appeal , Pill L.J. -LSB- 1999 -RSB- Q.B. 634 , 652-656 examined Ford v. Metropolitan and Metropolitan District Railway Companies -LRB- 1886 -RRB- 17 Q.B.D. 12 and said that he did not think it bore out what Fletcher Moulton L.J. said . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	257	But in my opinion it plainly does and I think that the reluctance of the majority of the Court of Appeal to take it at face value was based upon a view of the principles of assessing compensation which was fundamentally mistaken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	258	To this I now turn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	259	The majority in the Court of Appeal thought that compensation for temporary damage was inconsistent with the process of valuation required by the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	260	The point was put clearly by Peter Gibson L.J. , at pp. 672-673 : `` What in my judgment is crucial is the date at which the value of the land is to be assessed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	261	In the present case it was accepted before the Lands Tribunal that the date by reference to which compensation must be assessed is the date when the works giving rise to the entitlement to compensation are complete . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	262	In the light of that , as well as the acceptance of the principle that there must be a loss in the value of the land for compensation to be recoverable , I do not understand how a temporary loss of value which would have been observable at earlier dates but which was no longer obtaining at the agreed date of assessment can give rise to a claim for compensation . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	263	This reasoning assumes that compensation under section 10 of the Act of 1965 can only be assessed by considering the capital value of the claimant 's land at a given date and deducting that sum from an estimate of what its value would have been if it had not been injuriously affected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	264	But there is nothing in the section which says that compensation for damage to the land must be calculated in this way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	265	The claimant is simply entitled to compensation for the damage to his land . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	266	Obviously if one is considering damage of which the effects will continue for some time into the future , such as the permanent deprivation of light or a right of way , it is sensible to take a valuation date and capitalise the value of the future loss at that date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	267	But in respect of damage which has occurred in the past , there seems to me no reason why one should not calculate the effect which it has had upon the value of the land in the sense of reducing its letting value in the open market while the damage continued . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	268	There must have been many cases in which the person claiming compensation for injurious affection held the land on a short lease at a rack rent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	269	The plaintiff in Ford v. Metropolitan and Metropolitan District Railway Cos. , 17 Q.B.D. 12 had a lease of seven years from 1880 , of which part must have been expired when the works took place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	270	We are not told what rent he paid but , with so short a tenancy , the chances are that it was a rack rent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	271	There could be no question of calculating the reduction in the capital value of his interest in the land , whether the damage to the rooms he occupied was , as I think , temporary , or , as Pill L.J. thought , permanent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	272	His leasehold interest probably had no value at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	273	But the injurious affection meant that for some period his rooms were worth less on the open market than they would otherwise have been - probably less than the rent he was paying . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	274	It was for this loss that he was entitled to compensation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	275	In Ford , 17 Q.B.D. 12 , 19-20 Lord Esher M.R. illustrated this point by reference to the fact that the works made it temporarily impossible to employ a housekeeper : '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	276	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	277	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	278	the absence of a housekeeper during the alteration of the building is evidence to shew that the building , as business premises , was rendered of inferior value , because if a building can not be used as a business building to the same advantage as it was before , it is an injury to the building as a business building . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	279	I therefore do not accept that a claim for loss of past rental value , or for or anticipated rental over a short period in the future , is an attempt , as Peter Gibson L.J. said -LSB- 1999 -RSB- Q.B. 634 , 673 , to `` dress up part of the temporary loss of profits as a loss of value of land when that value has not in fact been lost '' The answer of Lord Westbury in Ricket v. Metropolitan Railway Co. , L.R. 2 H.L. 175 , 204 seems to me as convincing today as it was then : `` It seems difficult to deny that the occupier of a public house , the value of which depends on its custom , has his interest in that house materially damaged by loss of custom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	280	It may always have been used as a public house , and as such has been let to the occupier , who takes it and pays a high rent for it as a public house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	281	When he took it , its value was ascertained and the rent fixed by reference to the custom it had ; and it seems in the highest degree unreasonable to strip the house of its character , and of the use and purpose for which it has been constructed , fitted , and employed ; and , having so done , to say that the interest of the occupier has sustained no damage because the building or structure has not been deteriorated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	282	A man gives a rent of # 100 per annum for a public house with good custom , long established in some much frequented thoroughfare , which house , if not used as a public house , would not be worth # 50 per annum . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	283	Suppose , then , that the thoroughfare should be wholly or partially obstructed , and the custom of the house thereby diminished by one-half , is it consistent with common sense to say that the interest of the tenant in the house is not materially prejudiced ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
226	284	What the decision of this House in Argyle Motors -LRB- Birkenhead -RRB- Ltd. v. Birkenhead Corporation -LSB- 1975 -RSB- A.C. 99 establishes is that one can not make a claim for loss of profit as such . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
226	285	Non constat that the interference which caused such loss of profit , which may have been attributable to the special nature of the business , has had the same or indeed any effect upon the open market letting value of the premises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
226	286	But there is nothing in authority or logic to say that the letting value of the premises can not be affected by an interference which makes it less convenient to conduct the kind of business for which they would otherwise have been suitable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
226	287	A plaintiff who can prove such a reduction in value , for whatever period , is entitled to compensation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
226	288	So in the Court of Appeal in Argyle Motors -LRB- Birkenhead -RRB- Ltd. v. Birkenhead Corporation -LSB- 1975 -RSB- A.C. 99 , 114 Buckley L.J. said that although no claim could be made for loss of profits : `` To avoid confusion , however , we add that this does not mean that , if injury to a business can be shown to have occasioned a diminution in the value of the land where the business is carried on , compensation can not be recovered for that injurious affection of the land . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
226	289	In the House of Lords Lord Wilberforce also said , at pp. 130-131 , that `` if -LSB- the appellants -RSB- can prove that a loss of profitability affects the value of their interest in the land they can recover compensation for this loss of value . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
226	290	There is no reason to suppose that Lord Wilberforce was thinking only of capital values . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
226	291	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
226	292	Conclusion I would therefore allow the appeal to the extent of restoring the opinion of the Lands Tribunal on question 3 but otherwise would dismiss it . 	lord hoffmann	self	outcome	1	lord hoffmann
