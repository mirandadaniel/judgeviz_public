285	11	Naomi Campbell sued the publishers of the Daily Mirror -LRB- `` MGN '' -RRB- for breach of confidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	12	She alleged that they had published information in respect of which she was entitled to privacy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	13	After a trial lasting five days in February 2002 , Morland J found the case proved and awarded her # 3,500 damages and costs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	14	This modest award reflected the fact that Ms Campbell conceded that her own conduct prevented her from objecting to the newspaper 's most serious allegation , namely , that she had been addicted to drugs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	15	Her complaint concerned the publication of additional details and photographs concerning the treatment she was receiving . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	16	In October 2002 the Court of Appeal unanimously reversed the decision of Morland J and dismissed the action , ordering Ms Campbell to pay the costs of the trial and 80 % of the costs of the appeal : -LSB- 2003 -RSB- QB 633 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	17	In May 2004 this House , by a majority of 3 to 2 , reversed the decision of the Court of Appeal , restored the order of Morland J. and ordered the respondents to pay Ms Campbell 's costs in the Court of Appeal and in this House : -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 2 AC 457 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	18	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	19	Pursuant to the order of this House , Ms Campbell 's solicitors served three bills of costs : # 377,070.07 for the trial , # 114,755.40 for the appeal to the Court of Appeal and # 594,470.00 for the appeal to the House of Lords . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	20	MGN were mortified to find that although the award of damages had been only # 3,500 -LRB- and five of the nine judges who considered the matter had thought that they should not be liable at all -RRB- , they were being asked to pay legal costs -LRB- in addition to their own -RRB- in the sum of # 1,086,295.47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	21	This may be compared with the # 1.5 m damages which the European Court of Human Rights in Tolstoy Miloslavsky v United Kingdom -LRB- 1995 -RRB- 20 EHRR 442 thought so disproportionate even for a foul and persistent libel upon a respected public figure that it infringed the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by article 10 of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	22	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	23	MGN likewise complain that their right to freedom of expression has been infringed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	24	They say that the threat of liability to pay a large sum by way of costs is just as likely to inhibit freedom of expression as the threat of liability to pay a large sum by way of damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	25	But the complaint is not , at any rate for the moment , concerned with the global figure for the costs of the whole proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	26	One reason is that the three bills have not yet been assessed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	27	Costs awarded by the High Court and Court of Appeal are assessed in accordance with principles stated in Part 44 of the Civil Procedure Rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	28	Only costs which have been proportionately and reasonably incurred and which are proportionate and reasonable in amount will be recoverable against the paying party : see rules 44.4 and 5 of the CPR . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	29	Costs in the House of Lords are taxed on similar principles by the Taxing Officers of the House : see Practice Directions Applicable to Judicial Taxations , para 15.1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	30	So the amount which turns out to be actually payable by MGN may be a good deal lower than the sum demanded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	31	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	32	In the meanwhile , in advance of assessment , MGN raise a point of principle about their liability to the costs of the proceedings in the House of Lords . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	33	A special feature of this stage of the proceedings was that Ms Campbell retained solicitors and counsel pursuant to a conditional fee agreement -LRB- `` CFA '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	34	At the trial and in the Court of Appeal they had acted under an ordinary retainer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	35	But the appeal to the House of Lords was conducted pursuant to a CFA which provided that if the appeal succeeded , solicitors and counsel should be entitled to success fees of 95 % and 100 % respectively . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	36	Thus the basic profit costs claimed by the solicitors and fees claimed by counsel came to # 288,468 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	37	Disbursements were # 26,020.65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	38	This basic total was more than twice the costs incurred by MGN but these figures remain , as I have said , subject to taxation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	39	It was the # 279,981.35 success fees which brought the figure up to # 594,470 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	40	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	41	By a petition presented to the House on 21 February 2005 , MGN seek a ruling of the Appeal Committee that they should not be liable to pay any part of the success fee on the ground that , in the circumstances of this case , such a liability is so disproportionate as to infringe their right to freedom of expression under article 10 of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	42	In view of the importance of this question , it has been argued before an enlarged Appeal Committee consisting of those members of the House who heard the substantive appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	43	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	44	Although CFAs first made an appearance in the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 , the legislation giving rise to this dispute is largely to be found in the Access to Justice Act 1999 and subsequent subordinate legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	45	-LRB- A full account of the earlier history will be found in the judgments of the Court of Appeal in Callery v Gray -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 1 WLR 2112 and Hollins v Russell -LSB- 2003 -RSB- 1 WLR 2487 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	46	Section 58 of the 1990 Act , which was substituted by section 27 of the 1999 Act , provides that a CFA which satisfies all the specified statutory conditions shall not be unenforceable by reason only of its being a CFA . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	47	This reverses the common law rule that it is unlawful for lawyers to charge fees which depend upon the outcome of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	48	A CFA may provide that fees and expenses are to be payable `` only in specified circumstances '' and may provide for a `` success fee '' by which , in specified circumstances , fees are increased above the amount which would be payable if they were not payable only in specified circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	49	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	50	The conditions laid down for an enforceable CFA are , inter alia , that it must relate to proceedings of a description specified by the Lord Chancellor , it must state the percentage by which the amount of fees which would be payable if it were not a CFA is to be increased and the percentage must not exceed the percentage specified by the Lord Chancellor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	51	The Conditional Fee Agreements Order 2000 -LRB- SI 2000/823 -RRB- allowed the use of CFAs in all litigation except criminal and certain family and environmental proceedings and fixed the maximum success fee at 100 % . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	52	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	53	Until the 1999 Act came into force , a successful litigant who used a CFA had to pay the success fee himself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	54	It could not be included in the costs recoverable from the losing party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	55	But this was changed when subsections -LRB- 6 -RRB- and -LRB- 7 -RRB- of the new section 58A were inserted into the 1990 Act : '' -LRB- 6 -RRB- A costs order made in any proceedings may , subject in the case of court proceedings to rules of court , include provision requiring the payment of any fees payable under a conditional fee agreement which provides for a success fee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	56	-LRB- 7 -RRB- Rules of court may make provision with respect to the assessment of any costs which include fees payable under a conditional fee agreement -LRB- including one which provides for a success fee -RRB- . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	57	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	58	Under the Civil Procedure Rules and its accompanying Practice Directions , success fees are now -LRB- subject to assessment -RRB- normally recoverable from the losing party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	59	Section 9.1 of the Practice Direction accompanying Part 44 of the CPR says that under an order for payment of ` costs ' the costs payable will include an `` additional liability '' incurred under a `` funding arrangement '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	60	A funding arrangement means a CFA or a policy taken out to insure against liability to pay the other side 's costs -LRB- `` after the event '' or `` ATE '' insurance -RRB- and an `` additional liability '' is the success fee or the ATE premium . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	61	Part 11.8 of the Practice Directions deals with the assessment of the success fee : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- In deciding whether a percentage increase is reasonable relevant factors to be taken into account may include : -LRB- a -RRB- the risk that the circumstances in which the costs , fees and expenses would be payable might or might not occur ; -LRB- b -RRB- the legal representative 's liability for any disbursements ; -LRB- c -RRB- what other methods of financing the costs were available to the receiving party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	62	-LRB- 2 -RRB- The court has the power , when considering whether a percentage increase is reasonable , to allow different percentages for different items of costs or for different periods during which the costs were incurred . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	63	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	64	It is important to notice the impact of the recoverability of success fees upon the principle that recoverable costs should have been proportionately and reasonably incurred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	65	The overriding objective set out in CPR 1.1 includes -- `` Dealing with the case in ways which are proportionate -LRB- i -RRB- to the amount of money involved ; -LRB- ii -RRB- to the importance of the case -LRB- iii -RRB- to the complexity of the issues ; and -LRB- iv -RRB- to the financial position of each party . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	66	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	67	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	68	As Lord Woolf CJ said in Lownds v Home Office -LRB- Practice Note -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 WLR 2450 , 2451 , the policy is that `` litigation should be conducted in a proportionate manner and , where possible , at a proportionate cost . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	69	But the test of proportionality and reasonableness is applied only to the basic costs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	70	It is not applied to the total sum for which the losing party may be liable after the addition of the success fee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	71	This is explicitly recognised in the Practice Direction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	72	Section 11.5 says : `` In deciding whether the costs are reasonable and -LRB- on a standard basis assessment -RRB- proportionate , the court will consider the amount of any additional liability separately from the base costs . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	73	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	74	The consequence is spelled out in section 11.9 : `` A percentage increase will not be reduced simply on the ground that , when added to the base costs which are reasonable and -LRB- where relevant -RRB- proportionate , the total appears disproportionate . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	75	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	76	These principles have been accepted as equally applicable to a taxation of costs in the House of Lords : see Designer Guild Ltd v Russell Williams -LRB- Textiles -RRB- Ltd -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 2003 -RSB- 2 Costs LR 204 at para 20 and para 26 of the House 's Practice Directions Applicable to Judicial Taxations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	77	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	78	Keith Ashby and Professor Cyril Glasser , in a recent article in the Civil Justice Quarterly -LRB- The Legality of Conditional Fee Uplifts -LRB- 2005 -RRB- 24 CJQ 130 , 134 -RRB- say that the success fee -- `` is added as a percentage bonus to the cost of work actually done , based not on any conduct or attribute of paying parties , but as a penalty for having lost in litigation against opponents who have entered into a particular type of contract with their own lawyers . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	79	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	80	I am not sure that `` penalty '' is quite the right word , but there is no doubt that a deliberate policy of the 1999 Act was to impose the cost of all CFA litigation , successful or unsuccessful , upon unsuccessful defendants as a class . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	81	Losing defendants were to be required to contribute to the funds which would enable lawyers to take on other cases which might not be successful but would provide access to justice for people who could not otherwise have afforded to sue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	82	In some kinds of litigation , such as personal injury actions , the funds provided by losing defendants were intended to be in substitution for funds previously provided by the state in the form of legal aid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	83	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	84	The consequences of this policy in relation to personal injury claims arising out of motor vehicle accidents were discussed by the Court of Appeal and this House in Callery v Gray -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 1 WLR 2112 -LRB- CA -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 WLR 2000 -LRB- HL -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	85	The legality of the policy of shifting the burden of funding that type of litigation from the state to unsuccessful defendants was not in dispute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	86	I myself described it as a rational social and economic policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	87	The effect was to internalise the cost of road accident litigation within the class of road users , because the liability insurers called upon to pay these costs passed it on to road users through increased premiums . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	88	The problem in Callery v Gray arose out of the removal of any market forces restraining the levels of success fees and ATE insurance premiums when they became payable only by the losing party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	89	As the client who agreed the success fee and the ATE premium has no financial interest in the matter , the only line of defence against excessive charges is the costs judges , who are handicapped by the lack of market-driven comparators on which to base their assessments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	90	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	91	This is not however a problem which arises in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	92	There has , as I have said , been no assessment in which the level of the success fees might be contested . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	93	The challenge is to the allowance of any success fee at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	94	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	95	That challenge is based upon the special position of the media as defendants to actions for defamation and wrongful publication of personal information such as that brought by Ms Campbell against the Daily Mirror . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	96	There is no human right to drive a vehicle upon the road free of the cost of litigation arising from road accidents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	97	But there is a human right to freedom of expression with which the imposition of an excessive cost burden may interfere . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	98	It is true that costs are awarded only against defendants who have been found to have wrongfully published matter which is defamatory or in breach of a claimant 's right to the confidentiality of personal information . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	99	So it may be said , and Ms Campbell 's counsel does say , that there is no harm in inhibiting such publications . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	100	But that , it seems to me , is not the point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	101	It is the effect which the threat of heavy liability may have upon the conduct of a newspaper in deciding whether to publish information which ought to be published but which carries a risk of legal proceedings against it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	102	When the European Court of Human Rights in Tolstoy Miloslavsky v United Kingdom -LRB- 1995 -RRB- 20 EHRR 442 said that damages of # 1.5 m in that case were an excessive and disproportionate restriction on freedom of expression , I am sure that they did not mean that people should be free to publish gross and deliberate libels at an affordable price , like the ancient Roman in the story of Aulus Gellius -LRB- Noctes Atticae 20.1.13 -RRB- who was followed by a slave carrying a bag of coins to pay the depreciated statutory penalty to the people whom his master insulted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	103	The court was concerned with the indirect effect of a high level of damages awards upon the ordinary bona fide work of the media . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	104	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	105	MGN nevertheless accept that freedom of expression under article 10 -LRB- 1 -RRB- may be restricted , as article 10 -LRB- 2 -RRB- says , on grounds prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society to protect the rights of others . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	106	The speeches in the substantive proceedings in this case discuss the relationship between the rights of the Daily Mirror under article 10 and Ms Campbell 's right to preserve the confidentiality of personal information . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	107	This right is one of the means by which our law protects the right to respect for private life guaranteed by article 8 of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	108	The availability of legal services under a CFA is necessary to provide the access to a court required by article 6 and thereby give litigants an effective means of enforcing their rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	109	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	110	Until the 1999 Act , legal aid was not available in defamation actions -LRB- see the Legal Aid Act 1988 , Schedule 2 , Part II , para 1 -RRB- , which were therefore the almost exclusive preserve of the rich . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	111	The Strasbourg court was fairly undemanding about this state of affairs , usually holding that it was not inconsistent with article 6 to expect both claimants and defendants in defamation proceedings to act in person : see McVicar v United Kingdom -LRB- 2002 -RRB- 35 EHRR 22 and a number of earlier Commission rulings cited in para 34 of that judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	112	But the court had said in an early decision -LRB- Airey v Ireland -LRB- 1979-80 -RRB- 2 EHRR 305 -RRB- that in complex cases article 6 might require some provision for legal assistance , the precise form being a matter for the member state . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	113	And most recently in Steel and Morris v United Kingdom -LRB- 2005 -RRB- Application No 68416/01 , 15 February 2005 it held that such assistance should have been provided to defendants in a lengthy and complex defamation action which had been brought against them by a multi-national company . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	114	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	115	It is however not necessary to decide that article 6 positively requires legal assistance in actions for defamation and the like in order to come to the conclusion that the provision of such assistance is a legitimate objective which , unless it amounts to a disproportionate burden , a member state is entitled to consider necessary in a democratic society . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	116	In principle , MGN accept this argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	117	But they say that in the circumstances of this case , an award of costs increased by a success fee is for two reasons disproportionate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	118	First , they say that it is necessarily disproportionate because it is more than -LRB- and up to twice as much as -RRB- the amount which , under the ordinary assessment rules , a costs judge would consider reasonable and proportionate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	119	Secondly , they say that it was not necessary to give Ms Campbell access to a court because she could have afforded to fund her own costs , as she did at the trial and in the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	120	In my opinion these arguments are flawed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	121	The first confuses two different concepts of proportionality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	122	The CPR on costs are concerned with whether expenditure on litigation was proportionate to the amount at stake , the interests of the parties , complexity of the issues and so forth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	123	But article 10 is concerned with whether a rule which requires unsuccessful defendants not only to pay the reasonable and proportionate costs of their adversary in the litigation , but also to contribute to the funding of other litigation , is a proportionate measure to provide those other litigants with access to justice , having regard to its effect on the article 10 right to freedom of expression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	124	MGN do not really deny that in principle it is open to the legislature to choose to fund access to justice in this way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	125	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	126	The argument therefore depends upon its second limb , namely that funding litigation in this way becomes disproportionate when a litigant does not need a CFA to be able to sue or , in this case , appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	127	Regulation 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- d -RRB- of the Conditional Fee Agreements Regulations 2000 -LRB- SI 2000/692 -RRB- requires a legal representative , before entering into a CFA , to inform the client `` whether other methods of financing those costs are available ... '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	128	But , as MGN concede , this rule is for the protection of the client , who may have some form of insurance which covers litigation costs and makes it unnecessary for him to enter into a CFA . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	129	It is not for the protection of the defendant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	130	Similarly , one of the matters to be taken into account in assessing the percentage to be allowed by way of success fee is `` what other methods of financing the costs were available to the receiving party '' : see section 11.8 -LRB- c -RRB- of the Practice Direction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	131	But that , in my opinion , is also concerned with whether the claimant had the right to have the litigation funded by someone else . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	132	It does not contemplate an investigation into his means to decide whether he could have taken the risk of paying the costs himself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	133	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	134	There is in my opinion nothing in the relevant legislation or practice directions which suggests that a solicitor , before entering into a CFA , must inquire into his client 's means and satisfy himself that he could not fund the litigation himself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	135	By what criteria should such an inquiry be conducted ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	136	An application for legal aid requires a disclosure of means and sets out elaborate criteria for eligibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	137	But there is no such machinery for a CFA . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	138	And if the solicitor is not expected to make such inquiries in advance , it would be most unfair for the success fee to be afterwards disallowed on the ground that his client had sufficient means . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	139	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	140	Ms Campbell denies that she is so wealthy as to be able to view with equanimity the risk of having to pay both her own and MGN 's costs of an appeal to the House of Lords . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	141	She says , probably with justification , that there can be few such individuals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	142	But I think that it would not matter even if she demonstrably had ample means to pay . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	143	It is true that when one has to balance rights such as freedom of expression against other rights such as privacy or access to a court , there has to be , as Lord Steyn said in In re S -LRB- FC -RRB- -LRB- A Child -RRB- -LRB- Identification : Restrictions on Publication -RRB- -LSB- 2005 -RSB- 1 AC 593 , 603 , para 17 , `` an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	144	So MGN says that in this case , Ms Campbell did not need a CFA and the balance therefore comes down in favour of freedom of expression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	145	But concentration on the individual case does not exclude recognising the desirability , in appropriate cases , of having a general rule in order to enable the scheme to work in a practical and effective way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	146	It was for this reason that the European Court of Human Rights decided in James v United Kingdom -LRB- 1986 -RRB- 8 EHRR 123 that Parliament was entitled to pursue a social policy of allowing long leaseholders of low-rated houses to acquire their freeholds at concessionary rates , notwithstanding that the scheme also applied to some rich tenants who needed no such assistance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	147	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	148	Thus , notwithstanding the need to examine the balance on the facts of the individual case , I think that the impracticality of requiring a means test and the small number of individuals who could be said to have sufficient resources to provide them with access to legal services entitled Parliament to lay down a general rule that CFAs are open to everyone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	149	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	150	It follows that in my opinion the success fee as such can not be disallowed simply on the ground that MGN 's liability would be inconsistent with its rights under article 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	151	The scheme under which such liability is imposed was a choice open to the legislature . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	152	Mr Spearman QC , who appeared for MGN , suggested various ways in which words might be read into article 3 of the Conditional Fees Order 2000 -LRB- which lists the proceedings for which CFAs are available -RRB- or CPR 44.3 B -LRB- which provides for the recovery of success fees -RRB- to make them compatible with article 10 by excluding cases such as this from the scope of CFAs or by disallowing the success fees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	153	But in my opinion there is no need for such measures because the existing scheme is compatible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	154	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	155	I can not however part with this case without some comment upon other problems which defamation litigation under CFAs is currently causing and which have given rise to concern that freedom of expression may be seriously inhibited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	156	They are vividly illustrated by the recent judgment of Eady J in Turcu v News Group Newspapers Ltd -LSB- 2005 -RSB- EWHC 799 -LRB- QB -RRB- , delivered on 4 May 2005 : `` 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	157	The claimant in these proceedings is seeking damages against News Group Newspapers Ltd , as publishers of The News of the World , in respect of articles appearing in the editions of that newspaper dated 3 November 2002 ... He issued his claim form under an assumed name -LRB- Alin Turcu -RRB- , almost at the end of the one year limitation period , on 31 October 2003 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	158	He only revealed his true identity in early February of this year , about two months before trial , as Bogdan Stefan Maris . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	159	He was born in Romania on 26 July 1980 and is thus now aged 24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	160	He appears to have borrowed the name Turcu from someone he knew in prison in Romania . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	161	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	162	The claimant 's false identity is not the only respect in which this case is unusual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	163	The claimant has not taken part in the trial and has not even served a witness statement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	164	Mr David Price , a solicitor advocate , has represented him on the basis of the instructions he received from his client , but without the advantage of his evidence to back up those instructions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	165	Mr Maris is apparently residing somewhere in Romania . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	166	Indeed , Mr Price told me before the trial began that he had last had contact with his client shortly after the true identity was revealed and , at the commencement of the trial , he remained out of touch and thus was only able to proceed on the basis of past instructions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	167	He did , however , indicate that telephone contact was resumed at some time during the first week of the trial - but still no witness statement was forthcoming . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	168	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	169	The evidence adduced by the defendant , which has not been challenged , is that the claimant is a petty criminal with a list of criminal charges or convictions at least in Romania , Germany , Italy and England . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	170	According to the evidence of a senior police officer from Neamt in Romania , `` he is known as a very intelligent criminal '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	171	He came to England in August 1999 using his assumed name of Turcu and made an application for political asylum on the basis of a statement , which has been produced in evidence , and which contains a largely concocted account of his life and circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	172	His application was rejected , but he was allowed exceptional leave to remain in this jurisdiction until 2004 , purely because he had lied , apart from anything else , about his age . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	173	He was thought to be 16 years old , whereas in fact by that time he was 19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	174	He had already been sentenced in Romania on three occasions to terms of imprisonment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	175	Had his true identity and age been revealed , he would not have been allowed to remain in this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	176	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	177	When he was arrested in 2002 he was found to be in possession of forged Greek and Italian identity documents bearing his photograph but false names . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	178	I can readily infer that the claimant had those documents to facilitate the commission of crimes and to mislead the law enforcement authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	179	He had been arrested in Italy only eight days before his arrival in England and that may possibly explain why he was seeking pastures new . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	180	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	181	He eventually obtained employment in London on the basis that he was here legally , and thus he deceived his employers also ... 6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	182	The claimant now seeks a large award of damages , including aggravated and exemplary damages , against the proprietors of The News of the World , who were denied the opportunity not only of cross-examining him but also of even seeing evidence from him denying their published allegations , or to support the serious charges of dishonesty made on his behalf in the course of the trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	183	He is able to pursue his claim purely because Mr Price has been prepared to act on his behalf on the basis of a conditional fee agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	184	This means , of course , that significant costs can be run up for the defendant without any prospect of recovery if they are successful , since one of the matters on which Mr Price does apparently have instructions is that his client is without funds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	185	On the other hand , if the defendant is unsuccessful it may be ordered to pay , quite apart from any damages , the costs of the claimant 's solicitors including a substantial mark-up in respect of a success fee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	186	The defendant 's position is thus wholly unenviable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	187	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	188	Faced with these circumstances , there must be a significant temptation for media defendants to pay up something , to be rid of litigation for purely commercial reasons , and without regard to the true merits of any pleaded defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	189	This is the so-called `` chilling effect '' or `` ransom factor '' inherent in the conditional fee system , which was discussed by the Court of Appeal in King v Telegraph Group Ltd ... This is a situation which could not have arisen in the past and is very much a modern development . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	190	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	191	After a trial which lasted from 5 to 18 April 2005 the action was dismissed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	192	The defendant 's costs were no doubt substantial and irrecoverable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	193	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	194	The blackmailing effect of such litigation appears to arise from two factors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	195	First , the use of CFAs by impecunious claimants who do not take out ATE insurance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	196	That , of course , is not a feature of the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	197	If MGN are right about Ms Campbell 's means , she would have been able to pay their costs if she had lost . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	198	The second factor is the conduct of the case by the claimant 's solicitors in a way which not only runs up substantial costs but requires the defendants to do so as well . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	199	Faced with a free-spending claimant 's solicitor and being at risk not only as to liability but also as to twice the claimant 's costs , the defendant is faced with an arms race which makes it particularly unfair for the claimant afterwards to justify his conduct of the litigation on the ground that the defendant 's own costs were equally high . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	200	That was particularly evident in the case of King v Telegraph Group Ltd -LSB- Practice Note -RSB- -LSB- 2005 -RSB- 1 WLR 2282 , to which Eady J referred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	201	In that case also , the claimant was without means and had no ATE insurance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	202	Nevertheless , as Brooke LJ observed : `` 58 ... There were no pre-action costs other than those associated with preparing the original letter before action , yet the claimant 's solicitors revealed that by the time the original statements of case had been exchanged they had already incurred costs in excess of # 32,000 -LRB- a sum equivalent to a potential liability of # 64,000 for the other side on the basis of a 100 % success fee -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	203	Over 54 hours of partner 's time had already been charged out at just over # 20,000 and over 48 hours of trainee solicitor 's time at over # 7,000 ... 64 ... the claimant 's solicitors served a substantial request for further information concerning the defence , to which the defendant responded in detail ... 65 -LSB- In reply , the claimant 's solicitors -RSB- dispatched a ten-page letter ... which was settled by junior counsel in as aggressive a style as their letter before action ... the preparation of this letter , to which the defendant 's solicitors were put to the expense of preparing a courteous and concise three-page -LSB- reply -RSB- ... would be charged out at # 750 per hour -LRB- assuming a 100 % mark-up -RRB- not including counsel 's fees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	204	73 ... the claimant 's witness statement contained 114 pages ... 74 ... -LSB- Counsel -RSB- observed that large parts of this witness statement were unnecessary ... 75 His main complaint , however , is that this was another area in which , in the context of litigation conducted by a claimant on a CFA without ATE cover , conduct of this kind was wholly out of place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	205	His clients would be put to irrecoverable expense in instructing their lawyers to consider this enormously lengthy statement , and in the event of any settlement into which they might be forced , not by the merits of the case but by purely commercial considerations , the claimant 's solicitors would probably be seeking twice their already high hourly costs for the work they did in connection with this statement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	206	76 He said that extravagant conduct of this kind could not be effectively policed by robust orders made by a trial judge -LRB- if the action ever went to trial -RRB- or by drastic surgery by a costs judge because by then the defendant had already incurred the irrecoverable costs of having to respond to it ... '' 32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	207	Brooke LJ was sympathetic to these complaints . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	208	He said -LRB- at para 99 -RRB- : `` What is in issue in this case ... is the appropriateness of arrangements whereby a defendant publisher will be required to pay up to twice the reasonable and proportionate costs of the claimant if he loses or concedes liability and will almost certainly have to bear his own costs -LRB- estimated in this case to be about # 400,000 -RRB- if he wins . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	209	The obvious unfairness of such a system is bound to have the chilling effect on a newspaper exercising its right to freedom of expression ... and to lead to the danger of self-imposed restraints on publication ... '' 33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	210	The solution , -LRB- `` the only way to square the circle '' -RRB- , offered by the Court of Appeal in Musa King was for the court at an early stage to make a `` cost-capping '' order , pre-empting the assessment of the cost judge by fixing a maximum amount -LRB- including any success fee -RRB- which , if the claimant was successful , the recoverable costs could not exceed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	211	Brooke LJ went on to say at para 102 : `` If this means ... that it will not be open to a CFA-assisted claimant to receive the benefit of an advocate instructed at anything more than a modest fee or to receive the help of a litigation partner in a very expensive firm who is not willing to curtail his fees , then his/her fate will be no different from that of a conventional legally aided litigant in modern times ... Similarly , if the introduction of this novel cost-capping regime means that a claimant 's lawyers may be reluctant to accept instructions on a CFA basis unless they assess the chances of success as significantly greater than evens -LRB- so that the size of the success fee will be to that extent reduced -RRB- , this in my judgment will be a small price to pay in contrast to the price that is potentially to be paid if the present state of affairs is allowed to continue .

285	213	In Callery v Gray -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 WLR 2000 all members of this House agreed that the responsibility for monitoring and controlling the new costs regime lay with the Court of Appeal and that this House should be slow to interfere . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	214	And I would certainly indorse the sentiments expressed by Brooke LJ in King 's case and hope that judges in lower courts will put his suggestions into practice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	215	It is , however , only a palliative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	216	It does not deal with the problem of a newspaper being faced with the prospect of incurring substantial and irrecoverable costs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	217	In the Turcu case , News Group Newspapers Ltd was financially strong enough not to submit to pressure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	218	But smaller publishers may not be able to afford to take such a stand . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	219	Furthermore , neither capping costs at an early stage nor assessing them later deals with the threat of having to pay the claimant 's costs at a level which is , by definition , up to twice the amount which would be reasonable and proportionate .

285	221	The Department of Constitutional Affairs , in a consultation paper published in June 2004 , after King 's case , discussed the problem but did not propose any legislative intervention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	222	It hoped that the representatives of the media and the lawyers who specialise in defamation and associated proceedings would negotiate an agreement in the way in which an agreement on costs had been agreed between personal injury lawyers and liability insurers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	223	The Civil Justice Council offered mediation services , although the consultation paper correctly observed that mediations work only if both sides want to try to find a mediated solution -LRB- see para 49 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	224	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	225	There are substantial differences between the costs in personal injury litigation which are the subject of the agreement and costs in defamation proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	226	In personal injury litigation one is for the most part dealing with very large numbers of small claims . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	227	The liability insurers are able to pass these costs on to their road user customers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	228	Their own solvency is not threatened . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	229	Furthermore , the liability insurers had considerable negotiating strength because they were able to fight what Brooke LJ described as trench warfare , disputing assessments of costs in many cases and thereby holding up the cash flow of the claimants ' solicitors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	230	Both sides therefore had good reasons for seeking a compromise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	231	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	232	In defamation cases , on the other hand , the reasons are much weaker . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	233	One is dealing with a very small number of claims to payment of relatively large sums of costs , which some publishers may be strong enough to absorb or insure against but which can have serious effects upon their financial position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	234	The publishers do not have the same negotiating strength as the liability insurers because there are few assessments to be contested and disputing them involves considerable additional costs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope

285	251	It is perhaps worth noting that , while civil legal aid is still available in Scotland under Part III of the Legal Aid -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1986 in actions for personal injury , para 1 of Part II of Schedule 2 to the Act provides that it shall not be available in proceedings which are wholly or partly concerned with defamation or verbal injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope

NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	254	The primary legislation from which the Lords of Council and Session derived their power to make these enactments is to be found in section 36 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Law Reform -LRB- Miscellaneous Provisions -RRB- -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1990 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	255	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	256	Under these agreements the fee is payable only if the client is successful in the litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	257	It is open to the advocate and the instructing solicitor , and to the solicitor and the client as the case may be , to agree that the fee , taxed as between party and party -LRB- which is the standard basis -RRB- or agreed , shall be increased by a figure not exceeding 100 per cent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	258	The amount of the permissible uplift was fixed by the Lord President of the Court of Session in 1992 following consultation with the Faculty of Advocates and the Law Society of Scotland . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	259	It was intended to reflect the degree of risk of non-payment of fees which would be involved in undertaking the litigation on the client 's behalf . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	260	But , in contrast to the system which now operates in England , it is the client who must pay the uplift if he is successful in the litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	261	It is not recoverable from the losing party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	262	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	263	The system of conditional fee agreements which was originally introduced in England under section 58 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 did not , of course , provide for the recovery of the uplift , or `` success fee '' as it was called in section 58 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- , from the losing party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	264	But section 58A of the 1990 Act , which was introduced by section 27 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Access to Justice Act 1999 , changed all that . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	265	Section 58A -LRB- 6 -RRB- provides that a costs order made in any proceedings may , subject in the case of court proceedings to rules of court , include provision requiring payment of any fees payable under a conditional fee agreement which provides for a success fee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	266	Conditional fee arrangements can not be the subject of an enforceable conditional fee agreement in criminal proceedings or family proceedings : see section 58A -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	267	Subject to those exceptions the system is available to litigants , as section 58A -LRB- 6 -RRB- says , in `` any proceedings '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	268	It is not possible to read these provisions as excluding proceedings in cases of defamation or breach of confidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	269	So , in contrast to the position in Scotland , litigation may now be conducted in these cases in England on the basis that if the client is successful it will be the losing party that has to pay the success fee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	270	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	271	Under the Scottish system , as was the case in the system which was originally introduced in England , the amount of the uplift is fixed by the agreement which the client has entered into with the solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	272	This then becomes a matter of contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	273	So it is not open to the client to have the amount of the uplift reduced when the solicitor 's account is being taxed , although the figure to which it is to be applied is subject to taxation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	274	The importance of the reference to the rules of court in section 58A -LRB- 6 -RRB- of the 1990 Act under the English system is to be seen against this background . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	275	It is to the rules of court that one must look to see what protection , if any , is afforded to the losing party under the new arrangement - bearing in mind that he was not a party to the agreement by which the amount of the success fee was fixed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	276	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	277	CPR rule 44.3 A provides for the assessment of costs where a funding arrangement that provides for a success fee has been entered into . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	278	The basis of the assessment is set out in rule 44.4 , para -LRB- 2 -RRB- of which provides that , where the amount of costs is to be assessed on the standard basis , the court will only allow costs which are proportionate to the matters in issue and that it will resolve any doubt which it may have as to whether costs were reasonably incurred or reasonable and proportionate in amount in favour of the paying party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	279	The expression `` costs '' for this purpose includes any additional liability by way of a percentage increase incurred under a conditional fee agreement : see the definitions of `` costs '' , `` funding arrangement '' and `` additional liability '' in rule 43.2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	280	These definitions are reflected in section 9.1 of the Practice Direction , which provides that under an order for payment of costs the costs payable will include an additional liability incurred under a funding arrangement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	281	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	282	In my opinion it is plain that rule 44.2 is intended to provide the paying party , who was not of course party to the funding arrangement entered into between the receiving party and his solicitor , with an opportunity to seek a modification of the amount of the success fee on the ground that is either unreasonable or is not proportionate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	283	The way the rule is intended to operate is described in section 11 of the Practice Direction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	284	Section 11.5 provides that , in deciding whether the costs claimed are reasonable and -LRB- on a standard basis -RRB- proportionate , the court will consider the amount of any additional liability separately from the base costs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	285	Section 11.9 declares that a percentage increase will not be reduced simply on the ground that , when added to the base costs , the total appears disproportionate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	286	The effect of these directions is that the exercise of applying the tests of reasonableness and proportionality to the percentage increase is , when compared with the task of applying these tests to the base costs , a separate exercise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	287	46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	288	Direction 11.8 states that in deciding whether a percentage increase is reasonable relevant factors to be taken into account may include , among other things , `` what other methods of financing the costs were available to the receiving party . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	289	This provision should be read in the light of regulation 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Conditional Fee Agreements Regulations 2000 -LRB- SI 2000/692 -RRB- about the information to be given to the client before a conditional fee agreement is made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	290	It uses the same expression , adding the words `` and , if so , how they apply to the client and the proceedings in question . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	291	It refers to other external sources of finance , whether as a result of insurance , membership of a trade union or otherwise , that may be available . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	292	This is not a means testing exercise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	293	The means of the client are irrelevant to the question whether or not it was reasonable for her to enter into a conditional fee agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	294	The most important question for the court in assessing reasonableness is the risk that the client might or might not be successful : see direction 11.8 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	295	In evenly balanced cases a success fee of 100 per cent might well be thought not to be unreasonable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	296	47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	297	There remains the question of proportionality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	298	The direction does not attempt to identify any factors that may be relevant , other than directing that the question whether the success fee is proportionate is a separate question from that relating to the proportionality of the base costs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	299	On the other hand it would be wrong to conclude that this is an empty exercise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	300	It is , in the end , the ultimate controlling factor which the court must apply if it is to ensure , in a case such as this which is for breach of confidence , that the right of access to the court of the receiving party to vindicate her right to privacy under article 8 of the Convention is properly balanced against the losing party 's article 10 right of free speech . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	301	Account must , of course , be taken of the fact that it is to be the losing party that is being called upon to pay the success fee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	302	But any reduction in the amount of the percentage increase that is to be paid by the losing party will have to borne by the client under her agreement with the solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	303	So the rights and interests of both sides must be considered and weighed up against each other in deciding whether , having regard to the interests at stake , the amount was proportionate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope

285	317	Prior to the passing of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 it was not possible for parties to litigation and their lawyers to enter into conditional fee agreements -LRB- `` CFAs '' -RRB- , whereby the lawyers were entitled to charge an extra success fee in the event of success in the litigation , but the clients would not be liable to pay the lawyers ' fees if they were unsuccessful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	318	The reasons why such agreements were unenforceable at common law and contrary to professional ethics are well known and do not require repetition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	319	They centre round twin concerns : first , the conflict of interest seen to exist in the temptation for a lawyer to advise settlement of a case below its value in order to secure payment of his costs and , secondly , the temptation for the client to press on with a hopeless and irresponsible claim in the hope that he might obtain some profit , while at no risk in respect of his own side 's costs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	320	As late as 1979 , when the government accepted the view of the Royal Commission on Legal Services to that effect , this was conventional morality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	321	51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	322	The government , allied with the Law Society , underwent a Pauline conversion in 1989 , when it published a Green Paper favouring the introduction of CFAs and followed it up by making statutory provision for them in the 1990 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	323	The reasons for the shift in opinion were described by Lord Woolf CJ in para 7 of his judgment in Callery v Gray -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 1 WLR 2112 , 2116 : `` The introduction of the legislation which made conditional fees lawful was motivated primarily by two problems in relation to the provision of legal aid for civil litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	324	The first was that progressively fewer members of the public were eligible for legal aid to bring civil proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	325	It was thought that the introduction of CFAs would have the effect of enabling those who could not afford to bring proceedings without the benefit of legal aid to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	326	The second problem was that the cost of providing legal aid was growing year on year . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	327	Accordingly the Government decided to reduce the areas of litigation which were funded by legal aid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	328	It was considered that this would not reduce access to justice since those affected could bring proceedings using CFAs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	329	The reason for reducing the areas of litigation eligible for legal aid was not , it was said , to reduce expenditure overall but rather to use the funds saved thereby to meet the need for publicly funded legal services to be provided in a different manner . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	330	52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	331	The subsequent history of CFAs has been fully set out in the opinion of Lord Scott of Foscote in the House of Lords in Callery v Gray -LRB- No 1 -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 WLR 2000 , to which I would refer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	332	For present purposes the two most significant developments were the extension of the scheme to defamation actions , which were originally not covered by it , and the provision in the Access to Justice Act 1999 and consequent rules of court which made the opposing party liable for payment of the successful party 's success fee and after-the-event insurance premium . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	333	The former change opened the way for claimants to pursue causes of action which could thitherto be afforded only by litigants with very deep pockets , as the size of the costs bills in the present case amply demonstrates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	334	The latter completely changed the balance between litigating parties : the losing party is now liable for not only his own costs , which he could generally not recover when he won against a legally aided party , but the success fee payable to the winner 's lawyer , which could be up to 100 per cent of the base costs , and even the premium paid by the winner for insurance to protect himself against the consequences of losing the case .

285	335	53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	336	It is , however , worth mentioning that that system has not been universally accepted in all parts of the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	337	As Lord Hope of Craighead has pointed out in paras 40 and 41 of his opinion , in Scotland the client who has succeeded in the litigation has to pay the success fee out of his damages and it can not be recovered from the losing party . 	lord carswell	lord hope	partagr	0.9	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope

285	339	It is still under consideration which of these will receive the support of the government as a substitute for the existing system of legal aid still in operation , but the model of litigation funding agreements has attracted considerable support .

285	341	It has to be said that there are many who regard the imbalance in the system adopted in England and Wales as most unjust . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	342	The regimen of CFAs and the imposition of these charges upon the losing party is , however , legislative policy which the courts must accept , as Lord Hoffmann has stated in para 16 of his opinion , and the present case has to be judged against this background . 	lord carswell	lord hoffmann	partagr	1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	343	55 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	344	It is necessary to bear in mind that the House has been asked to rule only on the matter of principle whether success fees can be charged at all in cases brought against the media involving issues such as breach of confidence or defamation or whether they are incompatible with article 10 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	345	That such fees constitute a `` chill factor '' can not be doubted , but the issue is whether they are a proportionate way of dealing with the issue of the funding of such litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	346	As Lord Hoffmann has stated -LRB- para 23 of his opinion -RRB- , it is not really in dispute whether the legislature can in principle adopt this method of funding access to justice . 	lord carswell	lord hoffmann	partagr	1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	347	56 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	348	The petition before the House then turns upon the question whether it is nevertheless still proportionate to permit the operation of the CFA system to the detriment of a losing defendant in a breach of confidence case when the claimant could be regarded as well able to afford to pay the costs and so as not being in need of the support of a CFA . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	349	It seems to me undeniable that there is a degree of roughness about the justice of this , but there are inevitably incidents of any system for the funding of litigation which will bear more harshly upon some parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	350	The practical problems involved in determining at the time when parties enter into CFAs with their lawyers whether they can afford to finance the litigation themselves would be enormous . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord carswell, lord hoffmann, lord hope
285	351	It was submitted on behalf of the appellant Ms Campbell , supported by the helpful written submission of the Law Society , that such an examination would be unworkable , and I have to agree with this conclusion , attractive as the idea might appear at first sight .
