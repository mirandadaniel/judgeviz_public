240	9	On 4 and 5 October 1999 the House heard two conjoined appeals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
240	10	At the end of the hearing the House dismissed both appeals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
240	11	This judgment records my reasons for agreeing to that way of disposing of the appeals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
240	12	In both appeals orders by magistrates for the return of individuals to the Republic of Ireland under section 1 of the Backing of Warrants -LRB- Republic of Ireland -RRB- Act 1965 were called into question on the grounds that the offences identified in the Irish warrants do not , as required by section 2 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , `` correspond '' with offences under English law , which are indictable offences or are punishable on summary conviction with imprisonment for six months . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
240	13	In a judgment given on 12 January 1998 the Divisional Court held in the case of Mr. Gilligan that the requirement of correspondence was satisfied : -LSB- 1998 -RSB- 2 All E.R. 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
240	14	At the same time the Divisional Court rejected a submission on behalf of Mr. Gilligan that the magistrate had erred in law in holding that he had no jurisdiction to entertain an abuse of process application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
240	15	Applying the reasoning in Gilligan the Divisional Court on 27 January 1998 held in the case of Mr. Ellis that the requirement of correspondence was also satisfied in his case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
240	16	The brief judgment is unreported . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
240	17	It will be convenient to start by considering the issue of correspondence in the light of the case of Mr. Gilligan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN

240	23	On 19 February 1997 a magistrate committed Mr. Gilligan for trial on three counts , namely , concealing or disguising property representing the proceeds of drug trafficking contrary to section 49 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994 ; attempting to remove from the jurisdiction property representing the proceeds of his drug trafficking contrary to section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 ; and assisting another person to retain the benefit of that other person 's proceeds of drug trafficking contrary to section 50 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994 .

240	36	Counsel told the court that there would be a preliminary issue to determine whether the court had jurisdiction to consider allegations of abuse of process as Mr. Gilligan contended that he had been improperly arrested for domestic proceedings in the United Kingdom in an effort to hold him in custody while the extradition request from Ireland could be perfected .

240	42	No evidence of the conduct constituting the Irish offences was adduced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
240	43	On 28 October 1997 the magistrate rejected submissions that the offences specified in the Irish warrants were not shown to correspond with relevant English offences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
240	44	He ordered Mr. Gilligan to be delivered up to Ireland . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN

240	46	The Backing of Warrants -LRB- Republic of Ireland -RRB- Act 1965 At the outset the core principles of the Act of 1965 , and the differences between the system contained in it and extradition under the Extradition Act 1989 must be explained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
240	47	There is no extradition treaty between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
240	48	The process for rendition between the two countries of persons accused and convicted is modelled on the backing of warrants system long familiar to English law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
240	49	Historically , magistrates in England only had local jurisdiction and a warrant was valid only in the jurisdiction of the issuing magistrate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
240	50	A fresh warrant had to be obtained if an accused went to another county . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
240	51	In due course the practice developed that where an accused left the jurisdiction where a warrant was issued a justice who had jurisdiction in the area where the accused was residing would endorse the warrant so that it could be executed in that jurisdiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
240	52	Blackstone observed that `` the practice of backing warrants had long prevailed without law '' : Commentaries on the Law of England , 7th ed. , 1772 , 290-292 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
240	53	Backing was a purely administrative process and the magistrate was not required to conduct any judicial enquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
240	54	From the middle of the eighteenth century the process was put on a statutory footing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
240	55	The successive statutes were progressively broadened in scope and laid down the duties of magistrates : see the review of the history in counsel 's argument in Reg . v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner , Ex patre Hammond -LSB- 1965 -RSB- A.C. 810 , at 814-817 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
240	56	The system of backing of warrants was adopted in respect of the rendition of persons between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
240	57	It was in due course put on a statutory footing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
240	58	Until 1965 it was regulated by the Indictable Offences Act 1848 and in the Petty Sessions -LRB- Ireland -RRB- Act 1851 both of which came into force at a time when the Republic of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
240	59	Under the Act of 1851 the endorsement of a warrant by a magistrate was administrative only : the English magistrate merely had to be satisfied as to the authenticity of the signature of the issuing Irish magistrate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
240	60	In 1922 the Irish Free State -LRB- Eire -RRB- was founded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
240	61	In 1949 it became a Republic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
240	62	In Reg . v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner , Ex parte Hammond a warrant endorsed by the Deputy Commissioner of the Garda Siochána -LRB- police -RRB- for execution in England was held to be unlawful because the Act of 1851 , which was still in force , required the warrant to be endorsed by the `` Inspector General , '' an office that had disappeared in 1922 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
240	63	At about the same time the Irish Supreme Court found that the system was unconstitutional : The State -LRB- Quinn -RRB- v. Ryan -LSB- 1965 -RSB- I.R. 70 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
240	64	These decisions led to the enactment of the Act of 1965 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
240	65	The purpose of the Act of 1965 was to create appropriate machinery for the backing of warrants and to introduce specific safeguards in the interests of justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
240	66	Section 1 of the Act of 1965 provides for the production and endorsement in the United Kingdom of warrants issued in the Republic of Ireland . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
240	67	Section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- reads as follows : `` Where -LRB- a -RRB- a warrant has been issued by a judicial authority in the Republic of Ireland -LRB- in this Act referred to as the Republic -RRB- for the arrest of a person accused or convicted of an offence against the laws of the Republic , being an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary conviction with imprisonment for six months ; and -LRB- b -RRB- an application for the endorsement of the warrant is made to a justice of the peace in the United Kingdom by a constable who produces the warrant and states on oath that he has reason to believe the person named or described therein to be within the area for which the justice acts or on his way to the United Kingdom ; then subject to the provisions of this section the justice shall endorse the warrant in the prescribed form for execution within the part of the United Kingdom comprising the area for which he acts .

240	90	A specimen warrant In order to explain the nature of the issue of law it will be sufficient at this stage to refer to a specimen warrant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
240	91	For this purpose I select the first and the most important warrant , namely that relating to the count of murder of Veronica Guerin . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
240	92	A schedule to the warrant describes the charge as follows : `` Statement of offence Murder contrary to Common Law and Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act , 1964 and as provided for in Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act , 1990 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
240	93	Particulars of offence You John Gilligan on the 26 June 1996 , at Naas Road , Clondalkin , Dublin , did murder one Veronica Guerin . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
240	94	The warrant was accompanied by certificates recording that it was issued by three judges of the Special Criminal Court of Ireland in accordance with the laws of Ireland and that murder is an indictable offence under the laws of Ireland . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
240	95	This warrant was duly endorsed by a Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
240	96	The submission Counsel for Mr. Gilligan argued before the Divisional Court that the definition of murder in Ireland and in England may be materially different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
240	97	In any event , he said that on the sparse particulars in the warrant there was no basis to think otherwise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
240	98	Accordingly , he submitted , the requirement of correspondence was not satisfied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
240	99	In a valuable judgment May L.J. -LSB- 1998 -RSB- 2 All E.R. 1 rejected this argument on the following grounds -LRB- at 16J-17A -RRB- : `` Apart from legal definition , murder is an ordinary English word meaning unlawful intentional killing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
240	100	No ordinary person would think twice before concluding that there is a sufficiently serious English offence which what is specified in this warrant would correspond with in English law if it had occurred in England , i.e. murder . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
240	101	I have indicated that in my view extraneous evidence is not admissible to determine ` the offence specified in the warrant , ' except that exceptionally evidence might be admissible for the strictly limited purpose of explaining technical language in the warrant or words which an English court would not otherwise understand . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
240	102	In my view , there is not such technical language here nor is ` murder ' in the particulars a word which an English court would not otherwise understand . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
240	103	In my judgment , submissions on other matters apart , the magistrate was plainly obliged to order Mr. Gilligan to be delivered up on this warrant . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
240	104	Counsel for Mr. Gilligan renewed his submission before your Lordships . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
240	105	I therefore must examine the merits of this argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
240	106	The preliminary question The question arises what materials the magistrate may take into account in deciding whether the requirement of correspondence is satisfied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
240	107	In the Divisional Court May L.J. held -LRB- at 10G-H -RRB- : `` The court has to read the warrant and find what offence is there specified in whatever form it is specified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
240	108	Habitually a warrant may specify an offence in a form equivalent to that used in indictments by giving a label and saying that the offence so stated is contrary to a statute or common law and then giving short particulars of what is alleged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
240	109	But however the warrant is drawn , that is what the court has to look at . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	110	No other material is admissible to determine ` the offence specified in the warrant , ' except that exceptionally evidence might be admissible for the strictly limited purpose of explaining technical language in the warrant or words which an English court would not otherwise understand . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	111	But such evidence would not extend to explaining the legal components in Irish law of any label given to the offence in the warrant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	112	A warrant with short particulars will to that extent specify conduct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	113	It is to that extent a conduct based inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	114	But the conduct is to be derived from the warrant , not from external material or evidence . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	115	On appeal to your Lordship 's House all sides accepted and supported this ruling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	116	In these circumstances it is sufficient for me to say that given the purpose of the Act of 1965 , as well as the wording of sections 1 and 2 , I would respectfully adopt the reasoning and conclusion of May L.J. on this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	117	The interpretation of the word `` correspond '' in section 2 -LRB- 2 -RRB- In renewing his submission on the interpretation of `` correspond '' counsel for Mr. Gilligan , and indeed counsel for Mr. Ellis , invited your Lordships to adopt a strict requirement of correspondence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	118	Counsel attached great importance to a judgment of the Irish Supreme Court , which was decided in 1970 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	119	In the The State -LRB- Furlong -RRB- v. Kelly -LSB- 1971 -RSB- I.R. 132 , an English warrant recited that the accused had entered premises and did there `` steal '' a certain machine . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	120	The court commented on the difficulties created by the Theft Act 1968 `` which could not have been foreseen in 1965 . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	121	It was held that it had not been shown that the offence specified in the English warrant corresponded to the offence of theft under Irish law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	122	The narrow reasoning of the court is reflected in the following passage in the judgment of O'Dalaigh C.J. -LSB- 141 -RSB- : `` If the English offence consists of , say , four essential elements a-b-c-d , then a corresponding Irish offence exists only if it contains either precisely these same four essential elements or a lesser number thereof . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	123	If the only Irish offence that can be pointed to has an additional essential ingredient -LRB- that is to say , if the Irish offence may be defined as a-b-c-d-e -RRB- , then there is no corresponding Irish offence to satisfy the requirements of section 47 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the -LSB- Irish Extradition -RSB- Act of 1965 for the simple reason that , ex hypothesi , conduct a-b-c-d falls short of being an offence under Irish law or , in plainer words , is not an offence .

240	124	It is fundamental to extradition that no one shall be extradited for acts or omissions -LRB- the offence alleged in the warrant -RRB- which , if repeated within the State , would not offend against our law . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	125	In Wyatt v. McLoughlin -LSB- 1974 -RSB- I.R. 378 the Irish Supreme Court came to the opposite conclusion in respect of a warrant which contained the words `` and did thereby steal the lorry contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	126	It was held that the popular meaning of these words corresponded to larceny under Irish law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	127	But the shadow of Furlong remained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	128	Walsh J. observed with the agreement of the other members of the Irish Supreme Court -LRB- at 398 -RRB- : `` For the reasons stated in Furlong 's Case , it is necessary that either the warrant or some other document accompanying it should set out sufficient information as to these acts to enable the courts of the State to identify the corresponding offence , if any , in our law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	129	It can not be sufficient simply to use the name by which the crime is known , or alleged to be known , in the requesting country even though that same name may be used in this country as the name of a crime , because the acts complained of , although having identical names , may constitute quite different criminal offences in different countries or , indeed , no offence at all in one of them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	130	For example , what constitutes embezzlement in one country may be larceny in another , and acts which would constitute the offence of abortion or unlawful homosexual behaviour in one country may not constitute any offence in the other . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	131	This dictum also reflects a technical approach at variance with the natural and contextual meaning of `` correspond '' in the statute , and it runs counter to the purpose of the backing of warrants system which was intended to be simple and straightforward . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	132	It is clear that in subsequent cases the Irish Supreme Court has not followed the restrictive approach in Furlong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	133	The view has prevailed that the words `` steal '' and `` rob '' in English warrants `` correspond '' to theft and robbery under Irish law : see Wilson v. Sheehan -LSB- 1979 -RSB- I.R. 423 ; Hanlon v. Fleming -LSB- 1981 -RSB- I.R. 489 ; O'Shea v. Conroy -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 2 I.L.R.M 527 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	134	It seems tolerably clear that Furlong does not represent current Irish law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	135	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	136	`` correspond '' is not a term of art : it is an ordinary English word not used in any special sense and must be so applied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	137	In this context it would be unwise to propose a synonym . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	138	It would not be right to embark on a search for a legal definition where the legislature thought none was necessary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	139	If one substitutes another word or words for `` correspond '' one will be inviting magistrates to construe and apply other words : Cozens v. Brutus -LSB- 1973 -RSB- A.C. 854 , at 861F-H per Lord Reid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
240	140	The task of magistrates is simply to apply the word `` correspond '' and to determine whether the test of correspondence is satisfied on the basis of a perusal of the warrants or , exceptionally , where technical words of expressions are involved , on all the materials before them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	141	Counsel for the appellants invited your Lordships to approach the meaning of the word `` correspond '' on the basis that it either mandates a test based on the conduct of the accused or by a comparison of the juristic elements of offences specified in the warrant with juristic elements of putative English offences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	142	While accepting that conduct and juristic elements are relevant matters in an examination of warrants there is no need to make the choice which counsel suggested . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	143	The correct approach is much simpler . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	144	For my part magistrates should approach the matter in the way indicated by the Divisional Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	145	May L.J. observed -LRB- at 10J-11C -RRB- : `` The offence specified in the warrant has to ` correspond with any offence under -LSB- English -RSB- law which is an indictable offence or is punishable on summary conviction with imprisonment for six months ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	146	The word ` any ' shows that the court is not necessarily looking for an English offence which is identical with the offence specified in the warrant nor one whose juristic elements are the same-rather for a sufficiently serious offence which what is specified in the warrant would correspond with in English law if what is specified in the warrant had occurred in England . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	147	-LRB- Sufficiently serious is defined as an indictable offence or one punishable on summary conviction with imprisonment for six months . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	148	The scheme is , not that the court has to find identical Irish and English offences , but that the offence specified in the warrant is a sufficiently serious Irish offence and that what is specified in the warrant would amount to some sufficiently serious English offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	149	The English offence , which may not be an identical offence , is not the offence specified in the warrant but a putative offence with which the offence specified in the warrant has to correspond . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	150	I would respectfully endorse this reasoning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	151	Conclusion on the first warrant in Mr. Gilligan 's case 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	152	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	153	if this approach is adopted , it is plain that the element of correspondence was satisfied in respect of the warrant charging murder . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	154	The magistrate was entitled to act on the basis that what is murder in the Republic of Ireland would also be murder in England . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	155	And , in any event , if the alleged contract killing of the victim -LRB- an investigative reporter -RRB- , did not amount to murder it would still be another indictable offence , i.e. manslaughter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	156	I would reject the contrary arguments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	157	The other warrants in Mr. Gilligan 's case The points advanced in respect of the other warrants were as follows : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The warrants alleging unlawfully importing a controlled drug -LRB- cannabis -RRB- into the State : Counsel pointed out that the case is concerned with shipments of drugs on the high seas . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	158	Counsel said that in English law the territorial limits are 12 miles off shore . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	159	It may be different in Ireland . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	160	-LRB- 2 -RRB- The warrants alleging possessing a controlled drug for the purpose of selling or otherwise supplying it to another : Counsel said the words ` or otherwise supplying ' introduces a material divergence between Irish law and English law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	161	-LRB- 3 -RRB- The warrants alleging possession or control of firearms and ammunition with intent to endanger life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	162	Counsel said that the words `` has with him '' , which are to be found in the relevant English statute , are materially different from the offence of possession or control of firearms specified in the warrants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	163	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	164	these are specious arguments in the context of the Act of 1965 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	165	The Divisional Court rightly rejected them : at 16A-E . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	166	In the case of each warrant there was an indictable offence under English satisfying the requirements of section 2 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	167	The submissions to the contrary must be rejected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	168	ELLIS In the case of Mr. Ellis there are four warrants : two of unlawfully and carnally knowing a girl under the age of fifteen and two of sexual assault on a female . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	169	The specified particulars of the two offences of unlawful carnal knowledge are that between certain dates Mr. Ellis did unlawfully and carnally know one Mary Clohessy , a girl under the age of fifteen years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	170	The specified particulars of the two offences of sexual assault on a female are that between certain dates Mr. Ellis did sexually assault one Mary Clohessy , a female . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
240	171	Before the magistrates there was no evidence of the conduct underlying the offences specified in the offences and there was no evidence of Irish law on the juristic elements of the offences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	172	The magistrates only had the warrants and accompanying certificates before them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	173	Counsel for Mr. Ellis argued that in the absence of evidence the magistrates could not be satisfied that the Irish offences corresponded to indictable English offences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	174	On 22 September 1997 the magistrates ordered Mr. Ellis to be returned to Ireland on the four warrants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	175	There was an application for habeas corpus . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	176	Following the decision in Gilligan counsel did not feel able to pursue this argument in the Divisional Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	177	Before your Lordships ' House counsel for Mr. Ellis did not in oral argument suggest that evidence was necessary on the correspondence issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	178	The thrust of his argument was that on the sparse particulars in the warrants magistrates were not entitled to conclude that the correspondence test was satisfied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	179	For example , counsel speculated that the phrases `` carnal knowledge '' and `` sexually assault '' may mean different things in the Republic of Ireland and England . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	180	The arguments of counsel invited your Lordships to step outside the real world . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	181	The offences specified in the first two warrants would amount in England to the indictable offence of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under sixteen contrary to section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	182	The offences specified in the third and fourth warrants would in England amount to the indictable offence of indecent assault on a woman contrary to section 14 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	183	The requirement of correspondence was plainly satisfied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	184	The arguments to the contrary must be rejected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	185	GILLIGAN : ABUSE OF PROCESS Mr. Gilligan argued before the magistrate that the magistrate had jurisdiction to stay the proceedings under the Act of 1965 as an abuse of the process . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	186	The magistrate ruled that he had no jurisdiction to entertain such an application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	187	The Divisional Court upheld this ruling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	188	Counsel for Mr. Ellis renewed this argument before the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	189	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	190	in agreement with the Divisional Court I am satisfied that the magistrate had no jurisdiction to entertain such an application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	191	First , section 2 -LRB- 2 -RRB- sets out in precise language limited statutory protections against oppression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	192	It is inconsistent with a general abuse of process jurisdiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	193	The protection in 2 -LRB- e -RRB- is particularly significant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	194	It provides that no order shall be made of inter alia if there are substantial grounds for believing that the warrant was in fact issued in order to secure the return of the accused for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing him on account of his race , religion , nationality or political opinions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	195	If an abuse of process jurisdiction existed there would be no need for such a specific protection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	196	Secondly , an abuse of process jurisdiction would undermine the legislative purpose of simple and expeditious proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	197	It would open the door in England to an examination of the facts relating to crimes allegedly committed in Ireland and to the circumstances of investigations by the police in Ireland . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	198	It would necessarily permit wide ranging evidence , letters of request and discovery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	199	It would create great scope for the delay of criminal proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	200	Thirdly , it must be borne in mind that in respect of extradition proceedings under the Extradition Act 1989 there is no abuse of process jurisdiction : In re Schmidt -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 1 A.C. 339 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	201	True it is that the Secretary of State 's discretion under the Extradition Act 1989 is regarded as a protection against oppression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
240	202	And this feature is not present under the Act of 1965 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	203	On the other hand , in respect of the Act of 1965 there is the countervailing consideration of longstanding and close ties between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	204	The process under the Act of 1965 is realistically regarded as essentially domestic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	205	The Act of 1965 is premised on the basis that the Irish courts are well able to guard against abuses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	206	I am therefore satisfied that a magistrate has no jurisdiction to entertain such an application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	207	In oral argument counsel for Mr. Gilligan submitted that , even if the magistrate has no jurisdiction to entertain an abuse of process application , the Divisional Court has an original jurisdiction to entertain such arguments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	208	No such application was ever made to the Divisional Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	209	The point does not arise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	210	In any event , I am satisfied that the language and purpose of the Act of 1965 rule out such an application to the Divisional Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	211	The legislature must be regarded as aware of the provision in section 10 of the Fugitive Offenders Act 1881 , which empowered a superior court -LRB- as opposed to a magistrates ' court -RRB- to discharge a fugitive when it would be unjust or oppressive to return him but nevertheless chose to make no such provision in the Act of 1965 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	212	The reasons are plain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	213	Ireland has a special position in English law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	214	And such a power would undermine the legislative purpose of a simple and expeditious procedure between neighbouring countries . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	215	In my view the High Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain an abuse of process application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	216	Having dealt with the legal position it is strictly unnecessary to discuss the factual basis for the allegation that there has been an abuse of process under the Act of 1965 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	217	It was suggested that the police authorities in the Republic of Ireland and in England were involved in a conspiracy against Mr. Gilligan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	218	It is necessary to put the record straight . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	219	The two police forces quite properly co-operated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	220	There was not an abuse of the process under the Act of 1965 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	221	DISPOSAL For the reasons given I assented to the dismissal of both appeals . 	lord steyn	self	outcome	0.7	NAN

240	226	First , in ordinary language `` correspond '' is a somewhat flexible verb . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	227	One can say that something corresponds exactly or closely or broadly with something else . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	228	Dictionaries such as The Concise Oxford Dictionary , The Shorter Oxford Dictionary and Chambers include as synonyms `` similar to '' or `` analogous to . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	229	I see no sufficient reason for treating the words in section 2 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1965 as requiring exact correspondence of all the ingredients of offences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	230	A general similarity should be enough and is present in these cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	231	Secondly , judicial experience elsewhere has led me to value the inherent jurisdiction of a high court to prevent abuse of process in matters concerning extradition , rendition and the like , even although its exercise is to be reserved for rare cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
240	232	I accept , however , that the historical and current relationship between the United Kingdom and Ireland and the legislative pattern provide a special context in which it is not inappropriate in Irish cases for the United Kingdom judiciary now to renounce in favour of the Irish judiciary residual control of the endorsed warrant procedure on abuse-of-process grounds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN

240	240	LORD CLYDE 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	241	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	242	The relationship between the UK and what is now the Republic of Ireland has always been a close one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	243	It is founded upon a long history . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	244	And while in the course of time constitutional changes have led to the separate identities of the two states the close relationship has continued and remains today . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	245	The point is illustrated by the successive arrangements made for the transfer of offenders between the respective jurisdictions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	246	In the earlier period simple procedures were provided under the Indictable Offences Act 1848 and the Petty Sessions -LRB- Ireland -RRB- Act 1851 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	247	After the constitution of Irish Free State in 1922 which became in 1949 the Republic of Ireland , it became evident that the former procedures were no longer available . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	248	That point was resolved in Reg . v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner , Ex parte Hammond -LSB- 1965 -RSB- A.C. 810 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	249	Prompt action was then taken in both the U.K. and Ireland to secure a solution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	250	The solution which was mutually arranged was by way of the backing of warrants , introduced in the U.K. by the Backing of Warrants -LRB- Republic of Ireland -RRB- Act 1965 , with reciprocal provisions in Ireland embodied in Part III of the Extradition Act 1965 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	251	This procedure was and is distinct from the regime of the Extradition Act 1989 in the U.K. Indeed by section 3 -LRB- 2 -RRB- the Republic of Ireland is specifically excluded from the definition of `` foreign state '' for the purposes of that Act and under The European Convention on Extradition Order 1990 -LRB- S.I. 1990 No. 1507 -RRB- the provisions of that Convention are not made to apply to procedures between the U.K and the Republic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	252	This is a reflection of the special relationship between the two States , a relationship which also finds expression in the legislation relating to nationality and immigration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	253	It is in the context of that special relationship that the present case requires to be considered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	254	The principle problem in the case arises out of the terminology of section 2 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1965 , and in particular the provision relating to the event that `` the offence specified in the warrant does not correspond with any offence '' under the local law of a stated degree of seriousness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	255	The meaning of the word `` correspond '' may be sufficiently clear but a question arises as to what is involved in its application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	256	It is common ground that an absolute identity is not required ; but there is dispute as to the extent of the specification which the magistrate ought to have before he may find a correspondence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	257	The appellants ask for a specification of all the essential ingredients of an English offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	258	To my mind that requires too high a standard . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	259	In my view it is sufficient that the material in the warrant specifies something similar or analogous to behaviour which constitutes an offence of the required gravity in the local jurisdiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	260	I reach that conclusion on the following grounds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	261	Firstly , the language of the Act itself supports such a view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	262	In the ordinary use of words `` correspond '' looks only for some similarity or analogy in the comparison . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	263	The word is unqualified , and no requirement is imposed that the similarity has to be in all the essential ingredients . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
240	264	A substantial similarity or an equivalence is all that is needed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	265	Secondly , the correspondence is to be with any offence , not simply the offence specified in the warrant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	266	It is enough if it corresponds with some criminal conduct of the required degree of seriousness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	267	That again points to the intention that a broad approach to the question of correspondence is appropriate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	268	Thirdly , the history of the legislation supports a broad approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	269	Under the earlier provisions all that was required was a simple administrative indorsation of a warrant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	270	The Act of 1965 was necessitated by the constitutional changes which had occurred but it is not to be expected that the necessary changes in procedure were intended to introduce any significantly greater elaboration in the technical requirements than were otherwise required . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	271	What was devised and introduced was a simple procedure , not involving any decision by the executive , but entrusting the critical decision to a magistrate or sheriff with the minimum of documentation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	272	The degree of correspondence should not then be expected to be particularly precise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	273	Finally , the purpose of the legislation is plainly to achieve a simple and expeditious method of transfer of persons between the United Kingdom and the Republic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	274	Any approach which involves detailed investigation and fine analysis of facts or of law is not likely to be intended and is totally out of keeping with what the ends of justice require . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	275	I find no error in the approach taken by the magistrates in the two cases and in my view the Divisional Court took the correct approach to the problem . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	276	This leads to the possible further question of the amount of material which the magistrate is entitled to have before him in assessing the matter of correspondence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	277	Again here I consider that the Divisional Court was correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	278	The contrast in language between the first leg of section 2 -LRB- 2 -RRB- `` if it appears ... `` and the second leg `` if it is shown ... '' must reflect a distinction and I consider that while the second may well require the support of extrinsic evidence , the first should not usually require any . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	279	The first leg deals with the case where `` it appears to the court that the offence specified in the warrant '' does not correspond with an offence of the stated gravity in the local jurisdiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	280	That provision seems to me to require the magistrate to determine the matter solely from what is specified in the warrant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	281	He should do that by construing the warrant in accordance with the ordinary use of language . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	282	While there may be circumstances where he requires elucidation of what is specified , in particular if there is some technical term or unusual word whose meaning is not known to him , explanation of that may be given . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	283	But beyond that , that is to say beyond the terms of the warrant sufficiently understood , he may not go . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	284	His task is to see if what is specified as an offence in the warrant corresponds with any offence in his own jurisdiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	285	In deciding whether the offence specified in the warrant corresponds with some offence in the local jurisdiction I do not consider that it is useful to attempt a distinction between matters of fact and matters of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	286	Generally the specification of the offence will comprise allegations of conduct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	287	The part played by the law is in the analysis of the factual elements necessary to constitute any given offence or in the construction of particular legal expressions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	288	But if all the magistrate is required to do is to read the terms of the warrant and understand them by applying the ordinary meaning of the words used , then no fine or sophisticated analysis should be called for . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	289	The warrant will specify the ingredients of the offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	290	But that does not mean that every detail requires to be given in every case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	291	In the case particularly of statutory offences the critical facts will require to be detailed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	292	But the degree of specification which is required will be a matter of circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	293	In some cases , where the act allegedly done notoriously constitutes criminal conduct little detail may be needed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	294	The complaint in the present appeals was that the specification given in the warrants was in every case insufficient to enable the magistrate to make a valid determination upon the matter of correspondence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
240	295	Certainly it is desirable in the interests of the effective implementation of the procedure that warrants should be drawn with care so that the magistrate will readily be able to decide whether there is or is not a corresponding offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
240	296	But I have no difficulty in holding that , with the exception of the two warrants relating to Gilligan identified by the Divisional Court , the magistrates were amply justified in concluding that there was a correspondence with offences in England . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
240	297	The strongest case for the appellants was in my view that relating to the warrant against Gilligan where the statement of offence read `` Murder contrary to Common Law and Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act , 1964 and as provided for in Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act , 1990 '' and the particulars of the offence read `` You John Gilligan on the 26th June 1996 , at Naas Road , Clondalkin , Dublin , did murder one Veronica Guerin . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
240	298	But even in that short information I consider that the magistrate was perfectly entitled to read the words as a layman would read them and hold that the law in his own jurisdiction included some offence of the required seriousness which corresponded with the offence specified in the warrant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
240	299	So far as the matter of the alleged abuse of process is concerned I am entirely persuaded that the Divisional Court was correct in holding that the magistrate had no jurisdiction to entertain a challenge based on such an allegation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
240	300	A distinct issue arose as to the jurisdiction of the High Court to entertain such an argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
240	301	That question does not appear to have been raised by Gilligan in the application for habeas corpus . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
240	302	The complaint in his affidavit is of his being disallowed from presenting the point before the magistrate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
240	303	Furthermore I am not persuaded that there is any substance in the point on the facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
240	304	He was lawfully arrested and detained under the English warrant for the purpose of criminal proceedings in England and there is nothing to support the suggestion that at some stage , through some supposed collusive arrangement between the Irish and the English authorities , the detention was prolonged until the former were in a position to proceed with their own warrants and make the application to have them backed under the Act of 1965 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
240	305	But in any event I am persuaded that the Act does not intend that the provision for redress given by section 3 extends further than a review of the matters which were within the jurisdiction of the magistrate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
240	306	The question here is one of the construction of the provisions of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
240	307	Parliament has set out in section 2 the extent of matters which may be canvassed before the magistrate , and when one finds in section 2 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- e -RRB- an express provision to deal with one kind of case where a prosecution may be being sought in circumstances which could amount to an abuse of basic rights and freedoms it seems to me particularly difficult to hold that an unlimited right of review was intended to be given in section 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
240	308	The necessity for expedition in the whole process and the respect for and confidence in the Irish judicial process which I have already identified as giving guidance to the approach to be adopted to this legislation also support the conclusion that a limited right of redress is intended by Section 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
240	309	It was for the foregoing reasons which I believe are in sympathy with those which have been stated by my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn that I considered that these two appeals should be dismissed . 	lord clyde	lord steyn	fullagr	1	NAN
