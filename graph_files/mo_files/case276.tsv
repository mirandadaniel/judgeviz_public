276	5	Over a period of about six years ending in March 1996 , Mr Andrew Payne , a solicitor practising near Solihull , misappropriated about # 750,000 held in his client account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	6	In each of the years 1988-1995 he delivered to the Law Society an accountant 's report in which Mr Ian Mascord , a partner in the firm of Sephton & Co of Solihull , certified that he had examined Mr Payne 's books and accounts and was satisfied that he had complied with the Solicitors ' Accounts Rules 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	7	Mr Mascord was negligent , if not worse , in signing these reports since he could not have made a proper examination without discovering the misappropriations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	8	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	9	The Law Society , which has broad supervisory and disciplinary powers over the profession , relied upon the reports by refraining from making the investigation it would have made if the reports had not been delivered or had indicated that something was amiss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	10	Mr Payne had staved off discovery by taking money from one client to pay off another -LRB- `` teeming and lading '' -RRB- but in April 1996 a client complained to the Law Society of delay in payment and on 17 May 1996 the Society 's investigating accountant discovered the deficiency . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	11	On 20 May 1996 the Society exercised its statutory powers of intervention ; Mr Payne was afterwards struck off the roll of solicitors and went to prison . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker

276	13	By section 36 of the Solicitors Act 1974 the Society is required to maintain and administer a Compensation Fund for the purpose of making grants for , among other things , the relief of loss caused by dishonesty on the part of a solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	14	The Society has power to make rules about the Fund and the Solicitors ' Compensation Fund Rules 1995 contain `` guidelines '' which explain the circumstances in which grants will ordinarily be made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	15	General principle -LRB- a -RRB- says that the `` basic object of the Fund is to replace ` client 's money ' misappropriated by a solicitor ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	16	General principle -LRB- b -RRB- emphasises that grants are wholly at the discretion of the Council and that `` no person has a right to a grant enforceable at law '' but that the intention of the Council is to `` seek to administer the Fund in an even-handed and consistent manner '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	17	Claims must be made in a form prescribed by the Society -LRB- Rule 5 -RRB- and delivered to the Society within six months after the loss has come to the knowledge of the applicant -LRB- Rule 6 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker

276	19	The first claim by a former client of Mr Payne was made on 8 July 1996 and over the following months more came in . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	20	The claims fell squarely within the object of the Fund and were duly paid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	21	The first payment was made in October 1996 and by 8 January 2003 the Fund had paid a total of # 1,245,764.11 -LRB- including interest -RRB- in respect of claims arising out of Mr Payne 's misappropriations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	22	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	23	On 8 October 1996 the Society wrote to Sephton & Co saying that they proposed to hold the firm liable for payments which had to be made out of the Fund and which they said were attributable to the negligent reports signed by Mr Mascord . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	24	Matters proceeded slowly , not least because the whole question of whether an accountant who gives such a report owes a duty of care to the Law Society was about to be litigated in other proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	25	The Society and Sephton & Co 's insurers agreed to await the outcome . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	26	In 1999 Sir Richard Scott V-C ruled in favour of the Law Society and on 29 June 2000 an appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed : see Law Society v KPMG Peat Marwick -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 1 WLR 1921 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	27	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	28	Negotiations continued but the claim form was not issued until 16 May 2002 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	29	On 20 May 2002 Sephton & Co 's solicitors wrote to say that they had been advised that that the limitation period had expired `` long ago '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	30	The defence filed on 24 June 2002 pleaded that the claims were statute-barred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	31	The Law Society denied that the limitation period had expired and pleaded in the alternative that Sephton & Co were estopped from relying upon the Limitation Act by representations made in the course of correspondence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	32	Both questions were ordered to be tried as preliminary issues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	33	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	34	The normal period of limitation prescribed by section 2 of the Limitation Act 1980 for an action founded on tort is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	35	Since a cause of action may accrue without the knowledge of the injured party -LRB- Cartledge v Jopling -LSB- 1963 -RSB- AC 758 -RRB- the six year period may expire before he is able to bring proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	36	In actions for negligence in which the cause of action accrues before the potential claimant knows the relevant facts , section 14A therefore prescribes an additional period of three years from the date on which he acquires such knowledge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	37	But this provision is of no use to the Law Society because , if the cause of action accrued before the commencement of the six year period , ie before 16 May 1996 , the Society knew all the relevant facts very shortly thereafter ; certainly well before the commencement of the three year period on 16 May 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	38	The Society can therefore bring the proceedings only if the cause of action accrued after 16 May 1996 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	39	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	40	The preliminary issues were tried by Mr Michael Briggs QC , sitting as an additional judge of the Chancery Division -LSB- 2004 -RSB- EWHC 544 -LRB- Ch -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	41	He ruled against the Society on both points , holding that the cause of action had accrued before 16 May 1996 and that Sephton & Co were not estopped from relying upon a limitation defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	42	The Court of Appeal agreed with the judge on the second point but , by a majority -LRB- Carnwath and Maurice Kay LJJ , Neuberger LJ dissenting -RRB- reversed his decision on the first point -LSB- 2004 -RSB- EWCA Civ 1627 ; -LSB- 2005 -RSB- QB 1013 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	43	Sephton & Co appeal to your Lordships ' House on the limitation issue and the Law Society cross-appeal on the estoppel issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	44	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	45	Damage is an essential element in a cause of action for negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	46	Mr Mascord was negligent when he signed his reports at various dates between 1988 and 1995 but the Law Society had no cause of action until it suffered damage in consequence of his negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	47	So the critical question is when the damage happened . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	48	Sephton & Co say that the Society suffered damage whenever Mr Payne misappropriated a client 's money after a negligent report had been delivered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	49	The misappropriation gave the client a right to make a claim on the Fund and liability to such a claim was damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	50	The Law Society says that it suffered damage only when a claim was made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	51	The misappropriation might have been repaid , either out of Mr Payne 's own money or , more likely , by some teeming and lading . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	52	The client might not have made a claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	53	All that could be said was that , once there had been a misappropriation , it was likely that there would be a claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	54	But the Law Society could not have commenced proceedings on the basis that claims were likely . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	55	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	56	There is , I am afraid , a good deal of recent authority on the point , which was considered at some length by Neuberger LJ in his thoughtful dissenting judgment and , slightly more summarily , by the judge and the majority in the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	57	As far back as Bell v Peter Browne & Co -LSB- 1990 -RSB- 2 QB 495 , 502B , Nicholls LJ said that `` the question of damage and the limitation period in negligence claims has been a troublesome one for some years '' and later cases show that the question has not ceased to trouble . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	58	An examination of a number of cases , including a recent decision of your Lordships ' House , is unavoidable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	59	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	60	It is not necessary to go back further than the decision of the Court of Appeal in Forster v Outred & Co -LSB- 1982 -RSB- 1 WLR 86 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	61	On 8 February 1973 Mrs Forster signed a mortgage by which she charged her farm to secure money which her son was borrowing to buy an hotel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	62	The business was a failure and on 21 January 1975 Mrs Forster was called upon to pay about # 70,000 , which she paid on 29 August 1975 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	63	In March 1980 she issued a writ against the solicitors who had advised her in connection with the mortgage , alleging negligence in not explaining the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	64	The question was whether the action was statute barred and that depended upon whether she suffered damage when she executed the deed -LRB- more than six years before the writ -RRB- or when she was called upon to pay . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	65	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	66	Stephenson LJ recorded -LRB- at p 93 -RRB- the submission of Mr Stuart-Smith QC , for the defendants : 13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	67	Later -LRB- at p 94 -RRB- , he recorded Mr Stuart-Smith 's submission on the meaning of the `` actual damage '' needed to complete a cause of action in negligence : 14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	68	Stephenson LJ said -LRB- at p 98 -RRB- that he accepted Mr Stuart-Smith 's statement of the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	69	The ambiguity in these passages -LRB- in an unreserved judgment in an interlocutory appeal -RRB- arises from the inclusion of the words `` it includes liabilities which may arise on a contingency '' in the second quotation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	70	As appears from the first passage , the thrust of Mr Stuart-Smith 's argument was that the mortgage , although the liability which it secured was contingent , had the immediate effect of depressing the value of Mrs Forster 's farm . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	71	But the reference to contingent liabilities in the second passage could give the impression that merely incurring a possible future liability -LRB- for example , by giving a guarantee or indemnity unsecured upon any property -RRB- counted as immediate damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	72	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	73	Dunn LJ also appears to have accepted the argument in the first quotation from Mr Stuart-Smith 's argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	74	He said , at p 100 : 16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	75	The broader interpretation of Forster v Outred & Co was unanimously rejected by the High Court of Australia in Wardley Australia Ltd v State of Western Australia -LRB- 1992 -RRB- 175 CLR 514 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	76	The principal judgment of Mason CJ and Dawson , Gaudron and McHugh JJ -RRB- is a masterly exposition of the law which deserves careful study . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	77	The State of Western Australia sued under a statute creating liability for misleading conduct , claiming that on 26 October 1987 it had been induced by the defendant 's misrepresentation to indemnify a bank against loss on a loan to a company in difficulties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	78	The indemnity was called in November 1988 and the State paid $ 22.5 m in December 1989 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	79	Proceedings were commenced on 24 October 1990 , within the three year limitation period provided by the statute , but the State applied on 14 January 1991 to amend to plead an additional misrepresentation on 25 October 1987 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	80	This was more than 3 years after the execution of the indemnity but less than three years after it had been called and paid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	81	The High Court decided that the State suffered no damage while its obligation under the guarantee remained contingent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	82	Damage occurred only when it was called . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	83	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	84	The High Court said , at pp 529 , 531 , 532 , that Forster v Outred & Co was explicable : 18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	85	I say at once that I am in complete agreement with this analysis , which provides the answer to this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	86	By virtue of the terms of the Solicitors ' Compensation Fund Rules 1995 , Mr Payne 's misappropriations gave rise to the possibility of a liability to pay a grant out of the Fund , contingent upon the misappropriation not being otherwise made good and a claim in proper form being made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	87	Such a liability would be enforceable only in public law , by judicial review , but would still in my opinion count as damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	88	But until a claim was actually made , no loss or damage was sustained by the Fund . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	89	I must however consider certain other authorities and contrary arguments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	90	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	91	My second quotation from the judgment of Stephenson LJ in Forster v Outred & Co -LSB- 1982 -RSB- 1 WLR 86 , 94 was approved by this House in Nykredit Mortgage Bank plc v Edward Erdman Group Ltd -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 1 WLR 1627 , 1630 , but the House did nothing to resolve the ambiguity which I have identified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	92	There was no need to do so because the context was altogether different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	93	In Nykredit the surveyor 's negligent valuation had led to the plaintiff obtaining what turned out to be inadequate security for his loan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	94	There was no question of a contingent liability ; the issue was whether a cause of action arose immediately or when the amount he was owed exceeded the value of his rights under the transaction -LRB- borrower 's covenant plus security -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	95	The House decided that it was the latter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	96	This was entirely in accordance with the principles discussed in the Wardley case , where , in a passage to which Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead referred , at p 1634 , Brennan J said , at 175 CLR 514 , 536 : 20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	97	Nykredit therefore decides that in a transaction in which there are benefits -LRB- covenant for repayment and security -RRB- as well as burdens -LRB- payment of the loan -RRB- and the measure of damages is the extent to which the lender is worse off than he would have been if he had not entered into the transaction , the lender suffers loss and damage only when it is possible to say that he is on balance worse off . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	98	It does not discuss the question of a purely contingent liability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	99	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	100	Next , there are a number of cases in the Court of Appeal which involve transactions , with both benefits and burdens , into which the plaintiff entered as a result of the negligence or breach of contract of the defendant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	101	None of these cases concerned purely contingent obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	102	It is only necessary to observe that in such bilateral transactions the answer to the question of whether damage has been suffered may be different according to whether the liability is for the consequences of the defendant not performing his duty or -LRB- as is usual in claims for misrepresentation -RRB- the consequences , or some of the consequences , of the plaintiff entering into the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	103	If the liability is for the difference between what the plaintiff got and what he would have got if the defendant had done what he was supposed to have done , it may be relatively easy , as Bingham LJ pointed out in D W Moore & Co Ltd v Ferrier -LSB- 1988 -RSB- 1 WLR 267 , to infer that the plaintiff has suffered some immediate damage , simply because he did not get what he should have got . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	104	Thus in Knapp v Ecclesiastical Insurance Group plc -LSB- 1998 -RSB- PNLR 172 , where the plaintiff paid a premium for a voidable fire insurance policy because his insurance broker had failed to disclose material facts , the Court of Appeal held that he had suffered immediate damage because he `` did not get what he should have got '' , namely a policy binding on the insurers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	105	On the other hand , if the damage is -LRB- as it was in Nykredit -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 1 WLR 1627 and First National Commercial Bank plc v Humberts -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 2 All ER 673 -RRB- the difference between the defendant 's position after entering into the transaction and what it would have been if he had not entered into the transaction , the answer may be more difficult . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	106	Despite the breach of duty , the transaction may on balance have originally been advantageous to the plaintiff and some evidence may be necessary to show when he was actually in a worse position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	107	The judgment of Mason CJ and his colleagues in Wardley drew attention to this distinction at 175 CLR 514 , 530-531 : 22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	108	Thus cases like Bell v Peter Browne & Co -LSB- 1990 -RSB- 2 QB 495 and Knapp v Ecclesiastical Insurance Group plc -LSB- 1998 -RSB- PNLR 172 are readily explicable as cases in which the damage was the difference between the plaintiff 's position as it was and as it would have been if the defendant had performed his duty and in which it was possible to infer that the plaintiff 's failure to get what he should have got from a bilateral transaction was quantifiable damage , even though further damage which might result from the flaw in the transaction was still contingent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	109	The plaintiff had paid money , transferred property , incurred liabilities or suffered diminution in the value of an asset and in return obtained less than he should have got . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	110	But these authorities have no relevance to a case in which a purely contingent obligation has been incurred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	111	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	112	The only case to which we were referred which can not in my opinion be explained in this way is Gordon v JB Wheatley & Co -LSB- 2000 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep PN 605 , in which the plaintiff sued his solicitors for negligence in wrongly advising him that a collective mortgage scheme did not require authorisation under the Financial Services Act 1986 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	113	As a result , he was obliged by the Securities and Investment Board to indemnify investors in the scheme against losses and this eventually cost him about # 676,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	114	He began his action more than six years after the advice had been given but less than six years after the SIB required him to indemnify the investors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	115	The Court of Appeal held that he had suffered loss when he continued to take investments after receiving the advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	116	The claim was statute-barred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	117	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	118	If , as a result of entering into the investment transactions , the plaintiff had obtained rights against the investors which were worth less than he should have got , the case would have been similar to Bell v Peter Browne & Co -LSB- 1990 -RSB- 2 QB 495 and Knapp v Ecclesiastical Insurance Group plc -LSB- 1998 -RSB- PNLR 172 , which the Court of Appeal said it was following . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	119	But , as Carnwath LJ pointed out in his judgment in this case -LRB- -LSB- 2005 -RSB- QB 1013 , 1054 -RRB- the risk of action by the SIB was not a liability arising directly from the investment transaction : 25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker

276	121	But otherwise , as Buxton LJ observed in Knapp 's case -LRB- -LSB- 1998 -RSB- PNLR 172 , 192 -RRB- there seems to be no authority inconsistent with the opinion of the High Court of Australia in Wardley that incurring a contingent liability is not , as such , actionable damage .

276	123	I turn to the wider policy considerations discussed by Neuberger LJ in his dissenting judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	124	In Wardley , the High Court said , at 175 CLR 514 , 527 -RRB- that it would be unjust to compel a plaintiff to institute proceedings before the existence of the loss is ascertained or ascertainable : 27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	125	In Knapp 's case , -LSB- 1998 -RSB- PNLR at 172 , 178 , Hobhouse LJ said that Wardley showed that Australia had adopted a different solution to the potential injustice caused by a strict application of the limitation period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	126	The judges had devised a stricter test for deciding when the cause of action accrued , whereas in England Parliament had introduced the alternative three year limitation period in section 14A . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	127	In Nykredit at -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 1 WLR 1627 , 1633 , Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said that : 28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	128	I respectfully think that the reasons of policy advanced by the High Court in Wardley 175 CLR 514 are somewhat overstated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	129	It is often the case that a plaintiff , who has plainly suffered some damage , is obliged to commence proceedings before the full effects of his injury can be known . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	130	This frequently happens in actions for personal injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	131	On the other hand , I do not agree with Hobhouse LJ that Wardley and section 14A of the 1980 Act are different solutions to the same problem . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	132	They are solutions to different problems . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	133	Allowing a plaintiff three years from the date on which he knows that a cause of action has arisen does not help if a mere contingent liability is treated as damage and the plaintiff , at the end of the three years , still does not know whether the contingency will eventuate or not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	134	On the other hand , Wardley is no answer to a case like Cartledge v E Jopling & Sons Ltd -LSB- 1963 -RSB- AC 758 , in which the plaintiff had on any view suffered damage but did not know it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	135	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	136	It also seems to me irrelevant that a prudent accountant , drawing up the accounts of the Compensation Fund to give a true and fair view of its assets and liabilities , would have included provision for contingent liabilities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	137	As Lord Radcliffe pointed out in Southern Railway of Peru Ltd v Owen -LSB- 1957 -RSB- AC 334 , 357 , the principles upon which such provisions are made does not depend upon `` any exact analysis of the legal form of the relevant obligation '' but upon estimates of what in practice is likely to happen . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	138	A cause of action , however , connotes a legal obligation and its existence must be determined by rules of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	139	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	140	In my opinion , therefore , the question must be decided on principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	141	A contingent liability is not as such damage until the contingency occurs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	142	The existence of a contingent liability may depress the value of other property , as in Forster v Outred & Co -LSB- 1982 -RSB- 1 WLR 86 , or it may mean that a party to a bilateral transaction has received less than he should have done , or is worse off than if he had not entered into the transaction -LRB- according to which is the appropriate measure of damages in the circumstances -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	143	But , standing alone as in this case , the contingency is not damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	144	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	145	The majority of the Court of Appeal appear to have decided the case on the basis that the Law Society did not enter into any transaction giving rise to the contingent liability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	146	It did nothing and the contingent liability was created by the misappropriations and the previous existence of the Compensation Fund and the rules which governed its administration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	147	No doubt in most cases in which a party incurs a contingent liability as a result of entering into a transaction , that liability will result in damage for the reasons already discussed in relation to bilateral transactions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	148	But I would prefer to put my decision on the simple basis that the possibility of an obligation to pay money in the future is not in itself damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	149	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker

276	195	The Law Society contends that even though it knew -LRB- from the moment when its investigating accountant reported on the true state of the solicitor 's accounts -RRB- that it was facing the prospect -LRB- or risk -RRB- of having to pay heavy compensation in due course , it did not suffer actual damage in the eyes of the law until it resolved to make its first payment out of the compensation fund to one of the solicitor 's former clients .

276	197	Against that Sephton contend that the Law Society was worse off from the time of each new misappropriation following the issue of successive untrue certificates -LRB- and knew it was worse off from the moment of the investigating accountant 's report as to the true facts -RRB- .

276	223	It is unnecessary to multiply examples of `` transaction '' cases but D W Moore & Co Ltd v Ferrier -LSB- 1988 -RSB- 1 WLR 267 calls for mention , since it has been cited in many later cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	224	A solicitor was instructed to prepare an agreement providing for the introduction of a new working director into an insurance business carried on by a company . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker

276	226	Through careless drafting the covenant was ineffective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker

276	231	A variation on the `` transaction '' cases , but one that to my mind shows essentially the same approach , is when a client instructs a solicitor to bring an action for damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	232	His claim is a chose in action and it is in effect entrusted to the solicitor to bring it to maturity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	233	The solicitor is liable for making his client 's chose in action valueless if he carelessly allows it to become statute-barred -LRB- or `` doomed to failure '' because a striking-out application would be bound to succeed : see Clarke LJ in Hatton v Chafes -LRB- a firm -RRB- -LSB- 2003 -RSB- EWCA Civ 341 , 13 March 2003 , para 23 ; also Sir Anthony Evans at para 82 -RRB- .

276	235	In all these cases the claimant has as a result of professional negligence suffered a diminution -LRB- sometimes immediately quantifiable , often not yet quantifiable -RRB- in the value of an existing asset of his , or has been disappointed -LRB- as against what he was entitled to expect -RRB- in an asset which he acquires , whether it is a house , a business arrangement , an insurance policy , or a claim for damages .

276	236	Your Lordships have not , I think , been shown any case in which the imposition on a claimant of a purely personal and wholly contingent liability , unsecured by a charge on any of the claimant 's assets , has been treated as actual loss .

276	242	Of all the cases cited to the House the only one that causes me any difficulty is the decision of the Court of Appeal in Gordon v J B Wheatley -LRB- a firm -RRB- -LSB- 2000 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep PN 605 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	243	In that case the claimant operated a private mortgage scheme through a number of companies which he controlled . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	244	The claimant 's case was that his solicitors failed to advise him properly about the requirements of the Financial Services Act 1986 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	245	The Securities and Investments Board began an investigation into his companies in May 1992 and alleged that the scheme was an unauthorised -LRB- and so unlawful -RRB- collective investment scheme . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	246	In September 1992 the claimant was advised -LRB- by other solicitors -RRB- to sign an indemnity making himself personally liable for any losses suffered by investors under the scheme , and in due course he became liable for over # 676,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	247	Kennedy LJ -LRB- with whom Kay LJ agreed -RRB- reviewed the authorities at some length , but the actual grounds of the decision , at p 612 , are rather briefly stated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	248	Kennedy LJ rejected the submission of counsel for the claimant that he was , when the various investments were made , `` only potentially worse off '' ; Kennedy LJ said that after the investments were made the claimant was exposed to a risk of an order under section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Financial Services Act 1968 , and He then went on to observe , 51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	249	I think that the first part of this reasoning can not be sustained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	250	The claimant 's risk of being subjected to an order under regulatory legislation can not to my mind be termed a contingent liability or a fetter on the claimant 's assets . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	251	The other way of expressing the ground of decision is more sustainable , on the basis that the claimant had got from his solicitor a defective scheme rather than one which was proof against regulatory attack . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	252	Even so , it seems to me close to the borderline . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	253	I see no good reason to stretch the `` defective product '' analogy to cover every situation in which a professional or commercial adviser carelessly gives inadequate advice and so produces a state of affairs which carries the risk of future loss ; and to do so would be contrary to the unanimous decision of this House in Nykredit -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 1 WLR 1627 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	254	52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	255	I would therefore reject Sephton 's submission that it was enough that the Law Society was , every time that misappropriations were made after the issue of defective accountant 's certificates , at risk of having to meet claims from clients from whom Mr Payne misappropriated funds -- even if that risk -LRB- of a future eventuality -RRB- is beguilingly expressed as `` exposure to claims '' -LRB- suggesting a present or current condition -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	256	It was in a sense a detriment , but it was not a detriment of the sort described in Forster v Outred & Co -LSB- 1982 -RSB- 1 WLR 86 , 94 as understood and developed in the later authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	257	53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	258	That conclusion is reinforced , in my opinion , by the public law character of the Law Society 's functions as trustee of the compensation scheme , but it does not depend on that special feature . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker

276	265	This is the second occasion within a short span when the House has to consider a question of limitation in the context of a claim in tort for economic loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	266	Haward v. Fawcetts -LSB- 2006 -RSB- UKHL 9 ; -LSB- 2006 -RSB- 1 WLR 682 concerned the knowledge required for the purposes of the special time limit for negligence actions `` where facts relevant to the cause of action are not known at -LSB- the -RSB- date of accrual '' -LRB- cf Limitation Act 1980 section 14A -RRB- .

276	267	The present case raises a prior issue regarding the date of accrual of the cause of action for the purposes of section 2 of the Limitation Act 1980 , which provides that `` An action founded on tort shall not be brought after the expiration of six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued '' .

276	268	56 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	269	A cause of action in tort may accrue for the purposes of section 2 of the Limitation Act 1980 -LRB- formerly section 2 of the 1939 Act -RRB- before its beneficiary knew or had reason to know of it : cf Cartledge v.

276	277	The Law Society 's claim is for loss sustained by its Compensation Fund in respect of a sole practitioner , Andrew Payne , who practised under the name of Payne & Co. from 1986 to 1996 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	278	The claim is against a firm of accountants -LRB- `` Sephtons '' -RRB- retained by Mr Payne to provide the Law Society annually with accountants ' reports containing the information prescribed by section 34 of the Solicitors ' Act 1974 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker

276	280	For the purposes of the preliminary issue before the House , it is accepted that between about January 1990 and March 1996 Mr Payne misappropriated client monies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	281	But Sephtons , through their partner , Mr Mascord -LRB- now deceased -RRB- provided clean annual reports for each of the years of practice ending on 30th April in the years 1988 to 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	282	58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	283	The Law Society alleges that , in reliance on such reports , it took no step to investigate or intervene in Payne & Co 's practice , and Mr Payne was able to continue to misappropriate client monies and to cover up prior misappropriations by teeming and lading . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker

276	300	Any cause of action by the Society for negligence accrued when the Society first suffered any `` actual '' damage of a relevant and measurable kind bearing in mind the measure of damage applicable to the wrong in question : see Forster v.

276	303	Sephtons submits that actual loss was sustained each time that the Society received from Sephtons a clean but negligently prepared report and relied upon it by allowing Mr Payne to continue to practise uninterrupted ; alternatively , that it was sustained when Mr Payne first misappropriated further client monies after the Society had received such a report and relied upon it by allowing Mr Payne to continue in practice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	304	If the Law Society is right , then any cause of action for negligence arose within six years prior to its issue of a claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	305	If Sephtons are right , the Law Society 's claim for negligence is time-barred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	306	The three year period in section 14A can not assist the Society , since it knew the relevant facts no later than 1996 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker

276	308	The Compensation Fund is a statutory grant-making fund first established under the Solicitors Act 1941 , and now established under section 36 of the Solicitors Act 1974 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	309	It is funded by a levy on practising members of profession . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	310	When it was first established in 1941 , there was no requirement of professional indemnity insurance in respect of solicitors - this was only introduced by the 1974 Act - and there would in any event have been obvious obstacles facing any insurance-based scheme operating to protect clients and the public in respect of dishonesty or misappropriation of monies by sole practitioners . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	311	There is no necessary equation between the redress available by a grant out of the Fund and that available in circumstances covered by professional indemnity insurance : see R v.

276	313	Under section 36 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , the Society may make a grant out of the Fund for the purpose of relieving loss or hardship where satisfied -LRB- a -RRB- that a person has suffered or is likely to suffer loss in consequence of dishonesty on the part of a solicitor , or his employee in connection with his practice or a trust of which he was trustee or -LRB- b -RRB- that a person has suffered or is likely to suffer hardship in consequence of failure on the part of a solicitor to account for money which has come into his hands in connection with his practice or any such trust or -LRB- c -RRB- that a solicitor has suffered or is likely to suffer loss or hardship by reason of his liability to any of his firm 's clients in consequence of some act or default of any of his partners or employees in circumstances where but for the liability of that solicitor a grant might have been made out of the Compensation Fund to some other person .

276	315	In deciding whether or not to make a grant out of the Fund , the Society has under section 36 a discretion , though one which is susceptible to judicial review to ensure that it is exercised on rational and intelligible grounds : see R v Law Society , ex p Mortgage Express Ltd. -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 2 All ER 348 and R v Law Society , ex p Ingman Foods Oy AB -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 2 All ER 666 .

276	316	In the former case , the Society exercised its discretion to limit the payment of compensation to that part of loss incurred through entering into a transaction on security brought about by a solicitor 's dishonesty which could be attributed to such dishonesty , as opposed to a subsequent fall in the market . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	317	It did this , although a solicitor 's duty is , in contrast to a valuer 's , not confined to obtaining or advising on adequate security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	318	The court upheld the exercise of discretion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	319	The breadth of the discretion and the fact that its exercise depends on the policies and circumstances at the time of any claim on the Fund appear from the judgment of Lord Bingham of Cornhill MR at p 360 : In the latter case , Latham J upheld the Society 's exercise of discretion to refuse a payment to an applicant whose recklessness the Society regarded as justifying a 100 % reduction .

276	351	A similar line of authority establishes that the cause of action against a solicitor whose negligence deprives his client of a claim which the solicitor was engaged to pursue accrues when the claim becomes time barred or liable to be struck out for want of prosecution -LRB- thereby obviously eliminating or reducing the value of any claim -RRB- : Hatton v.

276	353	In all these cases except Forster v.

NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	354	In Forster v. Outred the claimant 's case was that , but for the defendant 's negligence , she would never have entered into the transaction at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	355	But in that case , by doing so , she clearly depreciated the value of her house in a measurable way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	356	However , while a defendant 's failure to preserve or protect a particular asset by proper performance of his duty in relation to a particular transaction may readily be seen to have caused measurable loss , negligence causing a claimant to enter into a transaction which he would not otherwise have entered may not immediately , or indeed ever , cause measurable loss to any particular asset .

276	365	In Wardley Australia Ltd. v . The State of Western Australia -LRB- 1992 -RRB- 175 CLR 514 the State was allegedly led by misrepresentations by Wardley about Rothwells Ltd. , to grant to the bank an indemnity , which it would not otherwise have granted , in respect of a facility granted by the bank to Rothwells Ltd. .

276	367	The issue arose whether the State 's cause of action against Wardley accrued when the indemnity was granted or when it was called upon . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	368	The High Court held that the indemnity generated `` an executory and contingent liability '' and that the State `` suffered no loss until that contingency was fulfilled and time did not begin to run until that event '' -LRB- p 534 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	369	The High Court indicated that the contingency was fulfilled and the State incurred a liability to the bank `` if and when the Bank 's relevant ` net loss ' was ascertained and quantified , subject to the making of a claim for payment by the Bank '' -LRB- pp.524-5 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	370	In considering Forster v.

276	372	Wardley was considered in Knapp -LSB- 1998 -RSB- PNLR 172 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	373	Hobhouse LJ viewed it at p. 178A as adopting a different approach to the English approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	374	Buxton LJ at p.192A-D endorsed the rejection in Wardley of any proposition that The rejection in Wardley and by Buxton LJ of any such proposition is consistent with the English authorities discussed in paragraphs 71 to 73 above . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	375	Since the State 's liability through entering into the indemnity was purely contingent on whatever might happen to Rothwells and the bank facility and no particular State asset was depreciated in value on entry into of the indemnity , I think that the same result as the High Court reached in Wardley should also be reached in this jurisdiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	376	76 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	377	Whether or not that is , however , accepted , no English authority indicates and I do not consider that the Society 's present cause of action should be regarded as accruing before any change in its legal position occurred and it received any claim on the Fund . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	378	First and foremost , the Society 's legal position remained unchanged , even in public law , at least until after it received a claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	379	Second , it was not possible until after a claim was received for anyone to know which client -LRB- s -RRB- of Payne & Co might suffer what loss , whether any of them might be able , and choose , to assert that they had as a result suffered hardship justifying a grant out of the Fund and what the circumstances were in which the Society would have to exercise its discretion to make or refuse a grant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	380	Third , in this situation , it is not appropriate to talk of the Fund or any other specific asset of the Society as having suffered any loss at least until after a hardship claim was made on the Society . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	381	77 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	382	It may be that , if the facts had been known contemporaneously , some statistical or experience-based assessment could have been made of the likelihood of a claim or claims emerging , and of the Fund having eventually to make payments , as a result of Mr Payne being able to continue his scheme of fraud . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	383	A similar assessment might be made of the risk of future loss of a physical asset -LRB- deeds or valuables -RRB- of which a solicitor was failing to take reasonable care , but which had not yet been lost or stolen . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	384	But I do not consider that the law should treat purely contingent loss assessed on so remote a basis as sufficiently measurable , in the absence of any change in the claimant 's legal position and of any diminution in value of any particular asset . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	385	Even where negligence brings about a specific transaction and thus a change in the claimant 's legal position , Lord Nicholls observed in Nykredit -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 1 WLR 1627 in the passage at p.1631C-D cited in paragraph 73 above , that the mere entry into the transaction under which `` Financial loss is possible , but not certain '' is not sufficient detriment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	386	78 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	387	Looking at the matter more generally , I also see no particular reason to accelerate the accrual of a cause of action where there has been no transaction changing the claimant 's legal position and no diminution in value of any particular asset . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	388	Where such factors are present the English authorities considered in paragraphs 67-70 above take a clear-cut , though perhaps strict , view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	389	The House has not been asked to review such authorities , nor would I think it appropriate to do so in the light of the way that they and the English legislation have developed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	390	But where such factors are not present , I see attraction in the approach taken by the Australian High Court in Wardley 175 CLR 514 , the effect of which is that unless and until a remote contingency eventuates the claimant is not expected to issue proceedings which he would not normally issue or wish to issue unless and until that point arrives . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	391	79 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	392	Sephtons point out that in Nykredit -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 1 WLR 1627 , 1630 Lord Nicholls endorsed the Court of Appeal 's approval in Forster v. Outred & Co. of counsel 's submission that actual damage meant `` any detriment , liability or loss capable of assessment in money terms '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	393	There can , as I have said , be situations of measurable monetary detriment or loss , even though there has been no change in a person 's legal position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	394	But the passage which I have quoted from p.1631C-D in Nykredit shows that Lord Nicholls was far from accepting that everything that can loosely be described as `` detriment '' will constitute damage for the purposes of a tort claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	395	Lord Nicholls ' words are not in any event to be read as a statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	396	80 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	397	Sephtons also rely on Lord Nicholls ' statement at p.1633C-D that `` within the bounds of sense and reasonableness the policy of the law should be to advance , rather than retard , the accrual of a cause of action '' and that Differences between the limitation periods in contract and tort do however exist . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	398	These were indeed a central part of the argument mounted unsuccessfully in Henderson v. Merrett Syndicates Ltd. . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	399	-LSB- 1995 -RSB- 2 AC 145 to the effect that concurrent causes of action in contract and tort should not be recognised at all -LRB- cf pp. 151H-152B and 162G-163D -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	400	In his speech -LRB- with whom all other members of the House agreed -RRB- Lord Goff of Chieveley rejected what he described as `` the temptation of elegance '' -LRB- p. 186B -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	401	He said that In the present case , there is no question of the Society having any concurrent remedy in contract , and , even if there had been , there are limits to the extent to which the accrual of causes of action in contract and tort can be assimilated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	402	No issue regarding relevant and measurable damage can arise in contract , since nominal damages can be awarded for any breach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	403	Even in Nykredit -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 1 WLR 1627 any contractual claim accrued at a different time to any tortious claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	404	Here , the requirement of relevant and measurable damage before the accrual of a tortious claim has to be interpreted in the context of purely contingent liability occurring without any immediate change in the claimant 's legal position , and I see no reason to add to the strictness of the English legal position by treating the claimant as having suffered measurable loss before the contingency materialised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	405	81 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	406	Finally , Sephtons rely on the further Court of Appeal authority of Gordon v. J. B. Wheatley & Co. -LSB- 2000 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep PN 605 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	407	There , due to the defendant solicitors ' alleged negligence , the claimant was led to carry on , through various companies , business operations in a manner which amounted to the carrying on by such companies of unauthorised investment business within the Financial Services Act 1986 , section 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	408	Under section 6 of that Act the court had power to order any person contravening section 3 `` and any other person who appears to the court to have been knowingly concerned in the contravention to take such steps as the court may direct for restoring the parties to the position in which they were before the transaction was entered into '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	409	In due course the Securities and Investments Board -LRB- `` SIB '' -RRB- investigated the claimant 's operations and alleged a breach of section 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	410	The claimant approached fresh solicitors and on their advice resolved the matter by agreeing to indemnify the companies for over # 676,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	411	He sued the defendant solicitors within six years of doing this , but more than six years after the entry into of the unauthorised investment transactions -LRB- and also more than six years after he approached the fresh solicitors and incurred their fees -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	412	Kennedy LJ , with whom Kay LJ agreed , held that actual loss was incurred once the unauthorised investments were made , since `` the plaintiff was exposed to the risk of being required by a court ... to restore the parties -LRB- i.e. investors and borrowers -RRB- to the position in which they were before the transactions were entered into '' -LRB- p. 612 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	413	This was , he went on `` a liability , albeit a contingent liability , a fetter on his assets '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	414	82 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	415	In my view this reasoning is open to the objection that there was no liability , no change in the claimant 's legal position , unless and until the SIB intervened and the court ordered or the claimant agreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	416	Further , unlike the position in for example D W Moore & Co. Ltd. v. Ferrier -LSB- 1988 -RSB- 1 WLR 267 or Knapp v. Ecclesiatical Insurance Group plc -LSB- 1998 -RSB- PNLR 172 , the risk to which the claimant was exposed did not directly arise from or affect the transaction into which the defendant negligently allowed the claimant to cause his companies to enter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	417	Rather it arose from the collateral regulatory powers and intervention of third parties , the SIB and the court , under independent legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	418	I do not think that the analysis applied in Knapp to a voidable contract between two parties can stretch to cover this situation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	419	In my view , therefore , this aspect of the Court of Appeal 's decision is unsustainable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	420	The actual outcome in the case may have been justified by the Court 's further conclusion -LRB- about which I need express no view -RRB- that actual loss was incurred when the fresh solicitors were instructed and liability for their fees was incurred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	421	83 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	422	For the above reasons , as well as those given in the opinions of Lord Hoffmann and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe , I would conclude that a cause of action in tort did not accrue in the Law Society 's favour against Sephtons until it first received a claim on its Fund from one of Payne & Co 's clients . 	lord mance	lord hoffmann	fullagr	1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	422	For the above reasons , as well as those given in the opinions of Lord Hoffmann and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe , I would conclude that a cause of action in tort did not accrue in the Law Society 's favour against Sephtons until it first received a claim on its Fund from one of Payne & Co 's clients . 	lord mance	lord walker	fullagr	1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	423	This is sufficient to lead to the dismissal of this appeal . 	lord mance	self	outcome	1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	424	Although it is not material on the facts , I would not , as at present advised , accept the Society 's argument that such accrual was further postponed until whenever the Society resolved to meet a claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord mance, lord walker
276	425	It appears to me more realistic to identify the fulfilment of the contingency on which the Society 's liability depended with the time when it received a claim in relation to which it became bound to exercise its statutory discretion to make a payment in accordance with its public law duties .
