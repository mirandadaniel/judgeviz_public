152	2	LORD NICHOLLS OF BIRKENHEAD 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	4	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	5	In this case the claimant Mr Haward invested money in a company on the advice of his accountant Mr Austreng . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	6	The company failed , and Mr Haward lost his money . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	7	The issue before the House concerns a defence of limitation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	8	This was tried as a preliminary issue in the action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	9	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	10	Statutes of limitation seek to hold a balance between two competing interests : the interests of claimants in having maximum opportunity to pursue their legal claims , and the interests of defendants in not having to defend stale proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	11	Traditionally the limitation period for most claims is six years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	12	This goes back to the Limitation Act 1623 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	13	On its face this period , with extensions in cases of fraud and mistake , is a generous , perhaps over-generous , period within which to be able to start court proceedings in respect of a wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	14	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	15	However , with certain types of claims this six year period would be far from generous or even reasonable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	16	The starting date for the six year limitation period is when a cause of action accrues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	17	In claims based on negligence a cause of action accrues when real damage , as distinct from minimal damage , is suffered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	18	This principle has been applied in limitation cases even where , at the date of accrual of the cause of action , the claimant did not know he had suffered damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	19	The injustices to which this harsh approach gave rise are well known . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	20	They were high-lighted in decisions of your Lordships ' House in appeals such as the pneumoconiosis case of Cartledge v E Jopling & Sons Ltd -LSB- 1963 -RSB- AC 758 and the defective chimney case of Pirelli General Cable Works Ltd v Oscar Faber & Partners -LSB- 1983 -RSB- 2 AC 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	21	There claimants were held to be statute-barred before they knew or could be expected to know they had suffered damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	22	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	23	Considerable difficulty has arisen in finding a satisfactory formula remedying this deficiency in the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	24	The relevant statutory provisions now current are sections 11 to 14B of the Limitation Act 1980 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	25	Section 11 made provision for special time limits in respect of personal injuries . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	26	Sections 14A and 14B , inserted into the 1980 Act by the Latent Damage Act 1986 , made similar provision for other negligence claims . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	27	The present appeal is concerned with these latter provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	28	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	29	Both sets of statutory provisions sought to remedy the deficiencies in the law by providing for an extended period of limitation to run from a date later than the date when the cause of action accrued . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	30	In the case of personal injuries claims the relevant later date , stated shortly , is when the person injured first knew his injury was significant , that the injury was attributable to the act or omission alleged to constitute negligence , and the identity of the defendant : section 14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	31	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	32	Parliament subsequently adopted a similar approach to other negligence claims . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	33	The extended three-year limitation period starts when the claimant first had both ` the knowledge required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the relevant damage ' and a right to bring the action : section 14A -LRB- 5 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	34	Section 14A -LRB- 6 -RRB- - -LRB- 10 -RRB- then defines what constitutes knowledge for this purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	35	Essentially knowledge means knowledge of certain facts , of which two are relevant in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	36	These two facts are , first , ` the material facts about the damage in respect of which damages are claimed ' and , second , ` that the damage was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence ' : section 14A -LRB- 6 -RRB- and -LRB- 8 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	37	For convenience I shall henceforth confine my references to section 14A , but my observations apply equally to the corresponding provisions in section 14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	38	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	39	By these provisions Parliament sought to identify the knowledge a claimant needs to possess before it is fair and reasonable that time should run against him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	40	That is their purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
152	41	This is made explicit in section 14A by its introductory description of the requisite knowledge as ` the knowledge required for bringing an action -LSB- etc -RSB- ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	42	The claimant is to have a reasonable period , set by Parliament at three years , in which to start proceedings after he has the knowledge he reasonably needs for that purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	43	The degree of knowledge required 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	44	Two aspects of these ` knowledge ' provisions are comparatively straightforward . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	45	They concern the degree of certainty required before knowledge can be said to exist , and the degree of detail required before a person can be said to have knowledge of a particular matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	46	On both these questions courts have had no difficulty in adopting interpretations which give effect to the underlying statutory purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	47	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	48	Thus , as to the degree of certainty required , Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR gave valuable guidance in Halford v Brookes -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 428 , 443 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	49	He noted that knowledge does not mean knowing for certain and beyond possibility of contradiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	50	It means knowing with sufficient confidence to justify embarking on the preliminaries to the issue of a writ , such as submitting a claim to the proposed defendant , taking advice , and collecting evidence : ` suspicion , particularly if it is vague and unsupported , will indeed not be enough , but reasonable belief will normally suffice ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	51	In other words , the claimant must know enough for it to be reasonable to begin to investigate further . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	52	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	53	Questions about the degree of detail required have mostly arisen in the context of the need for a claimant to know ` the damage was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence ' : section 14A -LRB- 8 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	54	Consistently with the underlying statutory purpose , Slade LJ observed in Wilkinson v Ancliff -LSB- 1986 -RSB- 1 WLR 1352 , 1365 , that it is not necessary for the claimant to have knowledge sufficient to enable his legal advisers to draft a fully and comprehensively particularised statement of claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	55	Where the complaint is that an employee was exposed to dangerous working conditions and his employer failed to take reasonable and proper steps to protect him it may well be sufficient to set time running if the claimant has ` broad knowledge ' of these matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	56	In the clinical negligence case of Hendy v Milton Keynes Health Authority -LSB- 1992 -RSB- 3 Med LR 114 , 117 , Blofeld J said a plaintiff may have sufficient knowledge if she appreciates ` in general terms ' that her problem was capable of being attributed to the operation , even where particular facts of what specifically went wrong or how or where precise error was made is not known to her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	57	In proceedings arising out of the manufacture and sale of the drug Opren Purchas LJ said that what was required was knowledge of the ` essence ' of the act or omission to which the injury was attributable : Nash v Eli Lilly & Co -LSB- 1993 -RSB- 1 WLR 782 , 799 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	58	In Spargo v North Essex District Health Authority -LSB- 1997 -RSB- PIQR P235 Brooke LJ referred to ' a broad knowledge of the essence ' of the relevant acts or omissions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	59	To the same effect Hoffmann LJ said section 14 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- requires that ` one should look at the way the plaintiff puts his case , distil what he is complaining about and ask whether he had in broad terms knowledge of the facts on which that complaint is based ' : Broadley v Guy Clapham & Co -LSB- 1993 -RSB- 4 Med LR 328 , 333 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	60	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	61	A similar approach is applicable to the expression ` attributable ' in section 14A -LRB- 8 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	62	The statutory provisions do not require merely knowledge of the acts or omissions alleged to constitute negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	63	They require knowledge that the damage was ` attributable ' in whole or in part to those acts or omissions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	64	Consistently with the underlying statutory purpose , ` attributable ' has been interpreted by the courts to mean a real possibility , and not a fanciful one , a possible cause of the damage as opposed to a probable one : see Nash v Eli Lilly & Co -LSB- 1993 -RSB- 1 WLR 782 , 797-798 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	65	Thus , paraphrasing , time does not begin to run against a claimant until he knows there is a real possibility his damage was caused by the act or omission in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	66	Irrelevance of knowledge that the act or omission involved negligence 12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	67	Difficulties may sometimes arise over the interaction of these ` knowledge ' provisions and the statutory provision rendering ` irrelevant ' knowledge that , as a matter of law , an act or omission did , or did not , amount to negligence : section 14A -LRB- 9 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	68	By the latter provision Parliament has drawn a distinction between facts said to constitute negligence and the legal consequence of those facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	69	Knowledge of the former -LRB- the facts -RRB- is needed before time begins to run , knowledge of the latter -LRB- the legal consequence of the facts -RRB- is irrelevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	70	As Sir Thomas Bingham MR said in the clinical negligence case of Dobbie v Medway Health Authority -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 WLR 1234 , 1242 , knowledge of fault or negligence is not necessary to set time running . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	71	A claimant need not know he has a worthwhile cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	72	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	73	A linguistic point , which can give rise to confusion , should be noted here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	74	Sometimes the essence of a claimant 's case may lie in an alleged act or omission by the defendant which can not easily be described , at least in general terms , without recourse to language suggestive of fault : for instance , that ` something had gone wrong ' in the conduct of the claimant 's medical operation , or that the accountant 's advice was ` flawed ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	75	Use of such language does not mean the facts thus compendiously described have necessarily stepped outside the scope of section 14A -LRB- 8 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	76	In this context there can be no objection to the use of language of this character so long as this does not lead to any blurring of the boundary between the essential and the irrelevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	77	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	78	This point is exemplified in Dobbie v Medway Health Authority -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 WLR 1234 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	79	The judge held the claimant had ` broad knowledge of sufficient facts to describe compendiously -LSB- 1 -RSB- that her breast had been unnecessarily removed , -LSB- 2 -RSB- that something had gone wrong , and -LSB- 3 -RSB- that this was due to the defendant 's negligence ' : -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 WLR 1234 , 1243 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	80	In the Court of Appeal this part of the judge 's reasoning was criticised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	81	These matters , it was said , were irrelevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	82	In my respectful view the Court of Appeal 's criticism was well directed so far as it related to the third of these three matters , but not so far as it related to the other two . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	83	The essence of the claimant 's case was that she had suffered injury by the removal of a healthy breast , that is , her breast had been removed unnecessarily and something had gone wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	84	These were the acts and omissions she alleged constituted negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	85	Under the statute time did not begin to run until she knew of these acts or omissions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	86	Until she was aware of these matters she could not know her injury was attributable to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	87	I agree with the observations to this effect made by the Court of Appeal in Hallam-Eames v Merrett Syndicates Ltd -LSB- 2001 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep PN 178 , 181 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	88	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	89	In many cases the distinction between facts -LRB- relevant -RRB- and the legal consequence of facts -LRB- irrelevant -RRB- can readily be drawn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	90	In principle the two categories are conceptually different and distinct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	91	But lurking here is a problem . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	92	There may be difficulties in cases where a claimant knows of an omission by say , a solicitor , but does not know the damage he has suffered can be attributed to that omission because he does not realise the solicitor owed him a duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	93	The claimant may know the solicitor did not advise him on a particular point , but he may be totally unaware this was a matter on which the solicitor should have advised him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	94	This problem prompted Janet O'Sullivan , in her article ` Limitation , latent damage and solicitors ' negligence ' , 20 Journal of Professional Negligence -LRB- 2004 -RRB- 218 , 237 , to ask the penetrating question : unless a claimant knows his solicitor owes him a duty to do a particular thing , how can he know his damage was attributable to an omission ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	95	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	96	This particular difficulty does not arise in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	97	The facts are set out fully by my noble and learned friend Lord Mance . 	lord nicholls	lord mance	factagr	0.1	NAN
152	98	Once Mr Haward knew enough for it to be reasonable for him to investigate whether Mr Austreng 's advice was flawed , he would thereupon have known his losses might well be attributed in whole or in part to that flaw . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	99	He would have known this , because he had relied upon Mr Austreng 's advice when investing money in the company . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	100	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	101	On the contrary , the present case calls simply for a careful application of section 14A -LRB- 8 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- as interpreted as summarised above . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	102	The judge 's approach was that Mr Haward knew all the material facts as they occurred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	103	He knew the terms of Mr Austreng 's retainer , he knew the advice Mr Austreng gave him , and he relied on that advice , with the consequence that he lost his money . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	104	The causal connection between the advice and the damage was patent and obvious . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	105	The only thing Mr Haward did not know was that Mr Austreng 's firm was -LRB- allegedly -RRB- negligent , or that he had a cause of action against the firm ; but those matters are irrelevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	106	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	107	This approach treats knowledge that Mr Austreng 's advice might well be flawed as irrelevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	108	The Court of Appeal held that in so doing the judge fell into error . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	109	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	110	I agree with the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	111	I agree with the Court of Appeal that the judge in the present case fell into the same error as the first instance judge in Hallam-Eames v Merrett Syndicates Ltd -LSB- 2001 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep PN 178 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	112	The language and intent of section 14A -LRB- 8 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- are clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	113	As already noted , in addition to having knowledge of the material facts about the damage , a claimant must know there was a real possibility the damage was caused by -LRB- ` attributable to ' -RRB- the acts or omissions alleged to constitute negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	114	The conduct alleged to constitute negligence in the present case was not the mere giving of advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	115	The conduct alleged to constitute negligence was the giving of flawed advice : Mr. Austreng did not give the advice appropriate to the true financial state of the company 's affairs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	116	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	117	This feature of the advice can not be brushed aside as a matter of detail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	118	Nor can it be treated , as it was by the judge , as a matter going only to particulars . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	119	Far from it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	120	This feature is the very essence of Mr Haward 's claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
152	121	Stated in simple and broad terms , his claim is that Mr Austreng did not do his job properly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	122	Time did not start to run against Mr Haward until he knew enough for it to be reasonable to embark on preliminary investigations into this possibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	123	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	124	There may be cases where the defective nature of the advice is transparent on its face . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	125	It is not suggested that was so here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	126	So , for time to run , something more was needed to put Mr Haward on inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	127	For time to start running there needs to have been something which would reasonably cause Mr Haward to start asking questions about the advice he was given . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	128	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	129	The judge made no specific finding about when that was in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	130	The judge did express a view on a different question , namely , when Mr Haward first knew he had a ` claim ' against Mr Austreng 's firm . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	131	On this question the judge held that Mr Haward had not discharged the burden of proving he first acquired this knowledge after 6 December 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	132	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	133	On the latter question the judge 's reasons were subject to forceful criticism by Mr Haward 's counsel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	134	But that is beside the point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	135	The relevant date was not when Mr Haward first knew he might have a claim for damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	136	The relevant date was an earlier date , namely , when Mr Haward first knew enough to justify setting about investigating the possibility that Mr Austreng 's advice was defective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	137	Mr Haward had the burden of proving that this date was after 6 December 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	138	Mr Haward , it seems , did not attempt to discharge this burden . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	139	His evidence was not directed at this anterior issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	140	His evidence was directed at the date when he first knew he might have a claim for damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	141	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	142	Accordingly , although the judge made no finding on this point , it is evident that , not having directed evidence to the relevant issue , Mr Haward failed to discharge the burden of proof resting on him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	143	It may well be that an investigation into a possible causal link between the losses and Mr Austreng 's advice , or the lack of it , did not begin until May 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	144	Jonathan Parker LJ so held -LRB- paragraph 147 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	145	But it by no means follows from this that until then Mr Haward lacked sufficient knowledge for it to be reasonable for him to set about investigating the possibility that Mr Austreng had slipped up when giving his advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	146	After all , the disparity between Mr Austreng 's advice and the company 's disastrous losses stared Mr Haward in the face long before December 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	147	And Mr Haward was an experienced businessman . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	148	In these proceedings Mr Austreng 's firm did not rely upon section 14A -LRB- 10 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	149	But this does not preclude the House from finding that this disparity confirms , if confirmation is needed , that Mr Haward failed to discharge the burden of proof resting on him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	150	I would allow this appeal and restore the judge 's order . 	lord nicholls	self	outcome	0.2	NAN

152	152	LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	153	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	154	Background to section 14A of the Limitation Act 1980 25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	155	This is a case in which professional negligence is alleged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	156	The defendant , appellant before your Lordships , is a firm of accountants , Fawcetts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	157	Mr J. H. Haward , the first respondent in the appeal , was a client of theirs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	158	In October 1994 Mr Austreng , a partner in Fawcetts , gave professional advice to Mr Haward regarding the proposed acquisition by Mr Haward of a company , then called Kings Stag Engineering Ltd but later re-named Haward Agriculture Ltd -LRB- henceforth `` the Company '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	159	On 9 December 1994 , and in reliance on the advice of Mr Austreng , Mr Haward -LRB- or his family company W. J. Haward Ltd , the second respondent -RRB- subscribed for 60,000 newly issued # 1 shares in the Company at par . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	160	This shareholding constituted a controlling interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	161	In addition a Haward family Trust -LRB- the third respondent -RRB- acquired the freehold of the leasehold premises from which the Company carried on business for a price of # 100,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	162	Fawcetts were appointed auditors to the Company . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN

152	175	The only reason the Company was not put into liquidation , for it was plainly insolvent in a balance sheet sense , was that the bulk of the family investment to which I have referred had taken the form of loans and the lenders , via Mr Haward , controlled the Company . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN

152	178	The involvement of Mr Hughes and associates of his in the Company 's business affairs and fortunes led eventually to a claim for damages for professional negligence being made against Fawcetts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN

152	180	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	181	The professional negligence claim was both a contractual claim and a claim in tort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	182	Fawcetts ' defence denied the alleged negligence but raised also the defence that the claims based on breaches of contract prior to 6 December 1995 were statute barred and that tortious claims for losses accruing prior to 6 December 1995 were likewise statute barred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	183	If this were so the negligence claim could proceed in respect of the 1996 , 1997 and 1998 investments but not in respect of the initial # 160,000 invested in 1994 nor in respect of the # 431,000 invested in 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN

152	187	It has , of course , been common ground throughout this litigation that the basic period of limitation for both the contractual claims and the tortious claims brought in these proceedings is six years from the date on which the causes of action accrued . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	188	The respondents , however , rely on the three year extended time limit provided by section 14A of the Limitation Act 1980 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	189	The question is whether , in relation to the 1994 and 1995 investments , their action is saved by section 14A . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	190	A limitation defence 32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	191	It seems to me desirable , before attempting to apply section 14A to the facts of this case , to review the nature of a limitation defence and the intended purpose of section 14A . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	192	It is important , in my opinion , to keep in mind that limitation defences are creatures of statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	193	The expression `` statute-barred '' makes the point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	194	And , in prescribing the conditions for the barring of an action on account of the lapse of time before its commencement , Parliament has had to strike a balance between the interests of claimants and the interests of defendants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	195	It is a hardship , and in a sense an injustice , to a claimant with a good cause of action for damages to which , let it be assumed , there is no defence on the merits to be barred from prosecuting the cause of action on account simply of the lapse of time since the occurrence of the injury for which redress is sought . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	196	But it is also a hardship to a defendant to have a cause of action hanging over him , like the sword of Damocles , for an indefinite period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	197	Lapse of time may lead to the loss of vital evidence ; it is very likely to lead to a blurring of the memories of witnesses and to the litigation becoming even more of a lottery than would anyway be the case ; and uncertainty as to whether an action will or will not be prosecuted may make a sensible and rational arrangement by the defendant of his affairs very difficult and sometimes impossible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	198	Each of the various statutes of limitation that over the years Parliament has enacted , starting with the Limitation Act 1623 -LRB- 21 Jac.1.c .16 -RRB- and coming down to the 1980 Act , represents Parliament 's attempt to strike a balance between these irreconcilable interests , both legitimate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	199	It is the task of the judiciary to identify from the statutory language and the purpose of each amending enactment the balance that that enactment has endeavoured to strike and to apply the enactment accordingly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	200	It is emphatically not the function of the judges to try to strike their own balance , whether as a response to the apparent merits of a particular case or otherwise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
152	201	In 1825 in A'court v Cross -LRB- 3 Bing .329 -RRB- Best CJ , commenting on the 1623 Act , said that he was `` sorry to be obliged to admit that the courts of justice -LSB- had -RSB- been deservedly censured for their vacillating decisions '' -LRB- p ,330 -RRB- and went on I think these strictures need to be borne in mind in the present case .

152	203	In reviewing the development of the statutory regime it is not necessary to delve deeper into history than the Limitation Act 1939 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	204	This Act prescribed a six year limitation period for both contract and tort actions but allowed an extended period for actions based on the defendant 's -LRB- or his agent 's -RRB- fraud or for relief from the consequences of a mistake -LRB- s. 26 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	205	In fraud and mistake cases the six year period did not begin to run until the fraud or mistake had been , or with `` reasonable diligence '' could have been , discovered by the claimant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	206	There was no extended period for cases where the damage had been suffered but had been undetectable by , and therefore unknown to , the claimant until after the six year limitation period had expired . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	207	Cartledge v Jopling & Sons Ltd -LSB- 1963 -RSB- AC 758 drew attention to this feature of the statutory regime and confirmed that the six year limitation period ran from the time the cause of action accrued , that is to say , in tort cases when the damage happened . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	208	Lord Reid at p. 772 said : Cartledge v Jopling was a personal injury case and all their Lordships advocated amendment of the 1939 Act to cover the case of undetectable physical injury that only becomes apparent years later . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

152	210	Parliament was swift to respond and the Limitation Act 1963 was enacted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	211	Section 1 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1963 Act enabled an action for personal injuries to be brought The meaning of `` material facts relating to that cause of action '' was defined in section 7 -LRB- 3 -RRB- : In Central Asbestos Co. Ltd v Dodd -LSB- 1973 -RSB- AC 518 a majority of this House rejected the proposition that knowledge of `` material facts '' for section 1 -LRB- 3 -RRB- purposes included knowledge that the defendant 's conduct entitled the plaintiff to a legal remedy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	212	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	213	The Law Reform Committee in its 1974 Report on Limitation of Actions in Personal Injury Claims -LRB- Cmnd .5630 -RRB- thought that the date of knowledge of material facts , when the applicable limitation period would start to run , should be the date `` when the plaintiff has knowledge , actual or constructive , both of his injured condition and of its having been caused by acts or omissions of the defendant '' -LRB- para . 55 and see para . 69 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	214	This Report led to the 1975 Limitation Act which was later consolidated into the 1980 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	215	Section 11 of the 1980 Act prescribes a three year limitation period for personal injury claims with the period commencing either when the cause of action accrued , i.e. when the damage occurred , or on `` the date of knowledge '' whichever be the later . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	216	Section 14 adopted the Law Reform Committee 's recommendation in para .69 of the Report as to when `` the date of knowledge '' would occur -LRB- see s.s -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

152	221	Attention was drawn to this feature of the statutory regime by Pirelli General Cable Works Ltd v Oscar Faber & Partners -LSB- 1983 -RSB- 2 AC 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	222	Damage to a factory arose out of the use of a material in constructing a factory chimney that was unsuitable for the purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	223	The chimney had been built in 1969 but the faulty condition of the chimney could not have been discovered with reasonable diligence until 1972 and was not in fact discovered until 1977 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	224	A writ was issued in 1978 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	225	The question was whether the six year period ran from the date the faulty chimney was built or from the date when the fault could have been or was discovered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	226	This House , following Cartledge v Jopling , held that the former was the starting date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

152	228	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	229	The Law Reform Committee took the problem under advisement again and recommended the adaptation of section 14 of the 1980 Act so as to provide an extension of time where the negligence complained of had led to the creation of a latent defect in property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	230	The Committee 's Report -LRB- Cmnd .9390 -RRB- resulted in the Latent Damage Act 1986 section 1 of which incorporated section 14A into the 1980 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	231	Just as Cartledge v Jopling had led to an extension of the limitation period in personal injury cases so the Pirelli case led to an extension in latent damage cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	232	Section 14A and its intended purpose are critical to the outcome of this appeal and it is helpful , in my opinion , to bear in mind some of the Law Reform Committee 's comments in its Latent Damage Report that led to the enactment of that section . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	233	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	234	In paragraph 4.2 the Committee formulated `` three principles ... of critical importance ... '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	235	They were : In para .4.4 the Committee commented that `` a plaintiff who has no means of knowing that he has suffered damage should not as a general rule be barred from taking proceedings by a limitation period which can expire before he discovers -LRB- or could discover -RRB- his loss '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	236	This comment is clearly directed at Pirelli type cases of latent damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	237	In para .4.8 the Committee recommended `` the adaptation of section 14 of the 1980 Act to cases of latent defect other than those of personal injury '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	238	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	239	Section 14A applies to any action for damages for negligence other than personal injury actions -LRB- s.s -LRB- 11 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	240	So although the provenance of section 14A was the problem presented by cases of damage to property where the damage was not immediately apparent , the section applies also to cases , such as the present case , where the damage consists of economic loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	241	Here , too , it is reasonable to suppose that the mischief being addressed was that of loss that was not immediately apparent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	242	Sub-section -LRB- 4 -RRB- of section 14A provides two alternative limitation periods , namely , the normal six year period from the accrual of the cause of action , or , alternatively , a three year period from `` the starting date '' as defined by sub-section -LRB- 5 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	243	It is convenient to set out sub-sections -LRB- 5 -RRB- to -LRB- 10 -RRB- in full . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	244	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	245	It is to be noted that sub-sections -LRB- 6 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- and -LRB- 7 -RRB- refer to `` material facts '' , an expression used in sections 1 -LRB- 3 -RRB- and 7 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1963 Act but not found in sections 11 and 14 of the 1980 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

152	248	In section 14A -LRB- 6 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- the reference is more limited - '' ... the material facts about the damage '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	249	The limited character of the reference is underlined by the definition of the expression in sub-section -LRB- 7 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	250	What is wanted is knowledge of `` such facts about the damage '' as would be expected to lead to the institution of a claim against a solvent defendant who had no defence to the claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	251	This demonstrates that the sub-section -LRB- 6 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- `` material facts '' of which knowledge is needed do not include any facts about the acts or omissions of the defendant that allegedly constitute the negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

152	253	In addition , however , to knowledge of the sub-section -LRB- 6 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- `` material facts '' , knowledge is needed also of the sub-section -LRB- 6 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- `` other facts '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

152	256	Nothing for present purposes turns on the `` other facts '' specified in -LRB- b -RRB- or -LRB- c -RRB- but -LRB- a -RRB- is critical . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

152	259	Section 7 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1963 Act had required knowledge of the fact that the personal injuries were `` attributable '' to the negligence , nuisance or breach of duty constituting the cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	260	In Central Asbestos Co. Ltd v Dodd Lord Pearson examined the meaning of `` attributable '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

152	262	The statutory language in sub-section -LRB- 8 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- has been considered in a number of cases and raises the question whether a claimant , in order to obtain the extended period of three years , need show no more than a lack of knowledge of an allegedly negligent act or omission that is a link in the causation chain leading to the damage , and regardless of the importance of that link in the chain .

152	273	What was the `` damage '' allegedly caused by Fawcetts ' negligence of which the respondents complain ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	274	The damage was the investment of the Haward money first in acquiring the Company and its business premises in 1994 and subsequently in trying to bring the Company to profitability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	275	The damage , as I think was common ground , was the making of a bad investment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	276	The measure of the loss depended on the eventual worth of the Company but the damage allegedly caused by Fawcetts ' negligence was the making of the investment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	277	Mr Haward plainly had knowledge that the investment of Haward money in 1994 and 1995 had taken place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	278	He knew the exact amount of money that had been invested . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	279	But , on the footing that it was indisputable that Fawcetts ' advice in respect of the investment had been negligent , at what date did Mr Haward know that the investment was a sufficiently seriously bad one to justify suing them ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	280	Mr Haward needs to establish that he did not have this knowledge until after 6 December 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	281	This is the sub-section -LRB- 6 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	282	47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
152	283	On this issue there can not , in my opinion , be any doubt but that Mr Haward had the requisite knowledge well before 6 December 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	284	He had made the initial investment in 1994 on the footing that a further # 100,000 or thereabouts would need to be injected into the Company 's business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	285	But the Company had steadily made losses and # 431,000 in 1995 , # 102,985 in 1996 and a huge # 509,525 in 1997 had had to be put into the Company in order to keep it a going concern . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	286	The 1997 accounts showed a loss for the year of over # 400,000 and an excess of liabilities over assets of # 658,872 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	287	So far as the 1994 investment and 1995 investment are concerned it can not , in my opinion , possibly be contended that there were any `` material facts about the damage in respect of which damages are claimed '' of which Mr Haward did not have knowledge by 6 December 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	288	48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	289	The critical issue , therefore , is whether by that date Mr Haward lacked knowledge that the `` damage '' , i.e. the investment of Haward money in 1994 and 1995 , `` was attributable in whole or in part '' to the acts or omissions of Fawcetts alleged to constitute negligence .

152	292	As to this I would , for my part , accept and apply the opinions expressed in Nash v Eli Lilly , Dobbie v Medway Health Authority and the Hallam-Eames case that the requisite knowledge is knowledge of the facts constituting the essence of the complaint of negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

152	296	Thus , paragraphs constitute to my mind the essence of the respondents ' complaint against Fawcetts , namely , that Fawcetts , their financial advisers , did not give them the advice that the true state of the Company 's affairs warranted and that , if given , would have warned them against a disastrous investment of their money . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	297	The other particulars are , in my opinion , essentially reasons why the failings alleged in paragraphs -LRB- a -RRB- , -LRB- e -RRB- and -LRB- g -RRB- were negligent failings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	298	51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	299	As to knowledge , Mr Haward knew what advice had been given by Fawcetts and he knew what advice had not been given by Fawcetts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	300	He knew by 6 December 1998 that the true financial state of the Company had required , if the Company were to keep trading , the very substantial additional investment that had to be made , and was made , to cover the losses incurred in the years 1995 , 1996 and 1997 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	301	He did not know that the advice actually given or the pleaded failings involved negligence , but knowledge of that is not required -LRB- see s. 14 -LRB- A -RRB- -LRB- 9 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	302	52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	303	Judge Playford QC summed up the situation very well in paragraph 20 of his judgment : In my opinion this summation was factually accurate and in accordance with the requirements of section 14A . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	304	53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	305	In the Court of Appeal Jonathan Parker LJ reviewed the relevant authorities meticulously and correctly identified that the critical issue was whether by 6 December 1998 the section 14A -LRB- 8 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- requirement of knowledge of attributability was satisfied -LRB- para .148 of his judgment -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	306	But he went wrong in my respectful opinion in paragraph 168 of his judgment when he said that there were `` on the evidence , a number of possible causes for the failure of the Company apart from Fawcetts ' advice -LRB- or lack of it -RRB- '' and that '' -LSB- Mr Haward -RSB- did not know -LSB- in July 1998 -RSB- that all or part of the damage was capable of being attributed to Fawcetts ' advice -LRB- or lack of it -RRB- . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	307	The Lord Justice was , it seems to me , looking at the wrong event . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	308	The `` damage '' allegedly caused by Fawcetts ' negligence was not the failure of the Company . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	309	The damage was the making by the respondents of loss-making investments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	310	Fawcetts could not have been made responsible for the failure of the Company . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	311	The respondents were seeking in the action to make Fawcetts responsible for their losses consequent upon the making of the investments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	312	Mr Haward needed to have knowledge that Fawcetts ' acts or omissions were causative of the making of the investments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	313	He plainly had that knowledge at the time the investments were made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	314	And very soon thereafter , in relation to the 1994 and 1995 investments -LRB- which is all that this limitation issue is concerned with -RRB- he knew that the investments were loss-making . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	315	As Judge Playford QC said , all he did not know was that Fawcetts ' advice -LRB- or the lack of it -RRB- had been negligent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	316	But that lack of knowledge is irrelevant -LRB- sub-section -LRB- 9 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	317	54 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	318	A decision of your Lordships in favour of the respondents , enabling the action to be brought within three years of the discovery by Mr Haward of why it was that the advice he had received from Fawcetts was negligent -LRB- if that is what it was -RRB- , or why it was that Fawcetts had not given him the advice that he alleges they should have given , would expand section 14A to cover cases that had nothing whatever to do with latent damage or losses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	319	It would expose those who give advice on financial matters to potential liability not simply until the expiry of three years after the loss-making consequences of the advice are known but until the expiry of three years after all the reasons why that advice was negligent are known . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	320	This , in my opinion , is an unjustifiable extension of the scope of section 14A , substantially altering the balance between claimant and defendant that Parliament has struck . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	321	For these reasons , and also for the reasons contained in the opinions of my noble and learned friends , with all of which I agree , I would allow this appeal and restore the order of Judge Playford QC . 	lord scott	all	fullagr	0.4	NAN

152	326	Despite the best efforts of the Law Commission the law in this area still has many problems . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	327	Section 14A of the Limitation Act 1980 , as inserted by section 1 of the Latent Damage Act 1986 , is closely modelled on sections 11 and 14 of the Limitation Act 1980 -LRB- which apply to actions for damages for personal injuries based on negligence , nuisance or breach of duty -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	328	Whether a claimant has suffered personal injury is in principle a straightforward question of fact , and the fact that the claimant has suffered personal injury is a given once it comes to the application of section 14 -LRB- definition of date of knowledge -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	329	56 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	330	Section 14A , by contrast , covers a much wider field -LRB- `` any action for damages for negligence , other than one to which section 11 of this Act applies '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	331	Moreover the word `` damage '' -LRB- as used in the expression `` relevant damage '' in subsections -LRB- 5 -RRB- and -LRB- 6 -RRB- and elsewhere in subsections -LRB- 6 -RRB- , -LRB- 7 -RRB- and -LRB- 8 -RRB- -RRB- must cover both latent damage to tangible property -LRB- as in Pirelli General Cable Works Ltd v Oscar Faber & Partners -LSB- 1983 -RSB- 2 AC 1 -RRB- and cases of pure economic loss , such as Hallam-Eames v Merrett Syndicates -LRB- 1995 -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep PN 178 -LRB- and the present appeal -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	332	The wide range of claims to which section 14A may extend suggests that general observations made by the court in one type of case may not be directly apposite in a case of another type . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	333	57 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	334	This appeal turns largely on the interpretation , and the application to a rather confused set of facts , of section 14A -LRB- 8 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	335	The effect of that provision is that the claimant must know , before time starts to run , that `` the damage was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	336	It is to be noted that this provision may involve an exercise in hindsight spanning a considerable period of time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	337	Its function is as part of the process of ascertaining the `` starting date '' defined in section 14A -LRB- 5 -RRB- -- that is , the date from which the alternative limitation period in section 14A -LRB- 4 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- is to run . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	338	As numerous reported cases show , the starting date may occur at a time when a claimant 's knowledge about his claim is far from complete . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	339	Inquiries and investigations may have to be made , and expert advice may have to be obtained as to how the claim should be pleaded , and how special damages should be quantified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	340	A claimant may have the requisite knowledge -LRB- as Slade LJ said in Wilkinson v Ancliff -LRB- BLT -RRB- Ltd -LSB- 1986 -RSB- 1 WLR 1352 , 1365 -RRB- But by the time , often years later , that the limitation issue comes to be decided , whether as a preliminary issue or at trial , the claimant 's case will have been pleaded , and the defendant 's `` act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence '' will -LRB- or at any rate should -RRB- have been clearly identified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	341	58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	342	There are , as Charles J recognised in the Court of Appeal in the present case , tensions arising from the juxtaposition of subsection -LRB- 8 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- with subsection -LRB- 9 -RRB- , which is in the following terms : Nevertheless section 14A -LRB- 8 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- requires , as already noted , something of an exercise in hindsight , looking back from the pleaded particulars of negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	343	The Court of Appeal has made clear that section 14A -LRB- 9 -RRB- excludes not only considerations of negligence in the technical sense but also the vaguer concept of fault -LRB- first put forward , in relation to section 7 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Limitation Act 1963 , by Lord Pearson in Central Asbestos Co Ltd v Dodd -LSB- 1973 -RSB- AC 518 , 543 -RRB- : see Broadley v Guy Clapham & Co -LSB- 1993 -RSB- 4 Med LR 328 , 333 -LRB- Hoffmann LJ -RRB- ; Dobbie v Medway Health Authority -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 WLR 1234 , 1242-1243 -LRB- Sir Thomas Bingham MR -RRB- ; and Hallam-Eames v Merrett Syndicates -LRB- 1995 -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep PN 178 , 181 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	344	59 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	345	I shall come back to these cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	346	But considering the matter for the present simply by reference to the statutory text , I think that it is clear that although section 14A -LRB- 9 -RRB- has the effect just mentioned , it can not go so far as to free the section entirely of any hint of legal technicality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	347	There are three pointers to this , all of which I have already mentioned : the word `` damage '' -LRB- which must in this context mean actionable damage , or at any rate what the claimant believes to be actionable damage , the cause of action being negligence -RRB- ; the words `` attributable to '' which are concerned in some way with causation , in the context of what becomes -LRB- once proceedings have been commenced and the claim pleaded -RRB- an allegation of negligence ; and the words `` acts or omissions alleged to constitute negligence . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	348	So although the claimant need not , at the starting date , know anything about the tort of negligence -LRB- not even its name -RRB- his or her state of knowledge can not be assessed , with hindsight , without some reference to legal concepts , including what is causally relevant in the context of a negligence action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	349	60 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	350	This point can be illustrated by the facts of a reported case which was discussed before your Lordships , HF Pension Trustees Ltd v Ellison -LSB- 1999 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep PN 489 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	351	The background to the case appears from the judgment of Knox J in Hillsdown Holdings Plc v Pension Ombudsman -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 1 AER 862 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	352	The matter arose from the takeover in 1983 of Fatstock Marketing Corp Ltd -LRB- FMC -RRB- by Hillsdown Holdings Plc -LRB- Hillsdown -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	353	The trustees of one occupational pension scheme -LRB- the FMC scheme -RRB- , acting on the advice of solicitors , transferred the entire assets of the scheme to another occupational pension scheme -LRB- the HF scheme -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	354	Soon afterwards the trustees of the HF scheme made a transfer of funds to the principal employer , Hillsdown . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	355	That company received about # 11.1 m and a further sum of about # 7.4 m -LRB- that is 40 % tax on the gross sum -RRB- was paid to the Inland Revenue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	356	The Pension Ombudsman 's decision , upheld by Knox J , was that the first transfer was an improper exercise of a fiduciary power and was therefore invalid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	357	Hillsdown repaid the sum transferred to it but recovery of the tax was uncertain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	358	The trustees of the FMC scheme sued the solicitors for damages for professional negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	359	The first transfer was made in November 1989 in reliance on advice given in May 1989 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	360	The second transfer was made in two tranches in December 1989 and June 1990 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	361	The writ was issued in October 1997 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	362	On a striking-out application it was accepted that the claim was statute-barred unless the plaintiff trustees could rely on section 14A . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
152	363	The solicitors argued that the last date on which damage occurred was in June 1990 -LRB- when the second tranche of the second transfer was paid -RRB- and that the plaintiff trustees then knew all the facts relevant to the pleaded case in negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	364	They knew the advice that the solicitors had given , and that they had acted in reliance on it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	365	It was not necessary , the solicitors ' counsel argued , for them to know that the advice was wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	366	The case seems to have been decided on a concession , recorded -LRB- after a reference to Perry v Moysey -LSB- 1998 -RSB- PNLR 657 -RRB- at p 495 : 61 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	367	In my opinion that concession was wrongly made , and should not have been accepted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	368	Until the FMC scheme trustees knew that they had received seriously incorrect advice which overlooked the need for propriety in exercising fiduciary powers , they did not know that the interests of their beneficiaries , the scheme members , were being prejudiced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	369	This lack of knowledge did not mean merely that they were ignorant of having a cause of action in negligence against the solicitors ; more fundamentally and more relevantly , they did not know that they -LRB- on behalf of the beneficiaries -RRB- had suffered any damage at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	370	They did not know that what had happened was not a more or less technical reorganisation of two pension schemes , but an improper abstraction of funds which might -LRB- if the tax was not recovered -RRB- deprive their beneficiaries of over # 7m . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	371	In short , they knew the bare facts , but they were ignorant of their real significance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	372	Their ignorance was at a different and more basic level than that addressed by section 14A -LRB- 9 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	373	62 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	374	Hallam-Eames v Merrett Syndicates -LRB- 1995 -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep PN 178 was another claim for pure economic loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	375	Hoffmann LJ delivered the reserved judgment of the Court -LRB- Sir Thomas Bingham MR , Hoffmann and Saville LJJ -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	376	It merits quotation at some length -LRB- at p 181 -RRB- : 63 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	377	Applying these principles , the Court of Appeal -LRB- reversing the judge -RRB- held that the claimants were not statute-barred because although they knew that they had lost large sums of money as a result of the run-off policies and RITC contracts entered into by their managing agents , they did not know that these heavy losses occurred because the business related to the US casualty market in which very large claims were being made for industrial pollution and asbestos-related risks . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	378	The claimants were ignorant of the real significance of the bare facts which they did know . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	379	The pollution and asbestos factors , which made it impossible to quantify incurred but not reported claims , were part of the essence of the complaint . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	380	64 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	381	It is no coincidence , I think , that both HF Pension Trustees and Hallam-Eames were cases of pure economic loss occurring in areas -LRB- occupational pensions and reinsurance at Lloyd 's -RRB- which call for specialised technical expertise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	382	Areas of that sort are those in which it is most likely that a claimant may know the basic facts , but not know what , to an expert , they add up to . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	383	65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	384	Similar problems can arise in clinical negligence cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	385	In that area too the factual situations which may be contended for as cases of latent knowledge are extremely diverse , and some of them are very fact-sensitive -LRB- for instance Nash v Eli Lilly -LSB- 1993 -RSB- 1 WLR 782 , drawing the distinction between acceptable and unacceptable side-effects of an anti-arthritis drug ; Oakes v Hopcroft -LSB- 2000 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep Med 394 , in which the claimant needed correct medical advice and legal advice before she knew that she had settled her original personal injury claim at too low a figure ; and by way of contrast Davis v Ministry of Defence -LRB- 26 July 1985 , CA Transcript No 413 of 1985 -RRB- , in which the claimant received unsound medical and legal advice -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	386	But it is in the field of economic loss that a higher proportion of difficult cases is likely to arise , for reasons given by Janet O'Sullivan in an astute recent article -LRB- Limitation , Latent Damage and Solicitors ' Negligence -LRB- 2004 -RRB- 20 JPN 218 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	387	66 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	388	Nevertheless the Court of Appeal has given clear general guidance as to the principle to be applied , even if its application raises , as it inevitably will , some difficult borderline cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	389	The general principle is set out in the second paragraph of the passage which I have quoted from Hallam-Eames . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	390	The Court is concerned with the identification of the facts which are the `` essence '' or `` essential thrust of the case '' or which `` distil what -LSB- the claimant -RSB- is complaining about . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	391	Mr Palmer QC -LRB- for the appellant firm of accountants -RRB- submitted that your Lordships should not follow Hallam-Eames , and should revert to a more starkly reductionist view of the minimum core of facts that must be within the claimant 's knowledge -LRB- actual or constructive -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	392	I am not entirely without sympathy for that submission , because this area of the law has become crowded with authority , and it is sometimes necessary to remind oneself that section 14A -LRB- introduced as it was by the Latent Damage Act 1986 -RRB- was intended to cover cases of latent damage -LRB- other than personal injuries -RRB- alleged to have been caused by negligence , and not causes of patent damage , even if they call for a good deal of investigation and advice before proceedings can be launched . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	393	-LRB- This is not a case where there was ever any doubt about the identity of the putative defendant ; the respondents put in the forefront of their case that Fawcetts were the Haward family 's long-standing and trusted financial advisers . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	394	There may well be scope for Parliament to clarify and simplify the law , and the Law Commission has put forward some radical proposals -LRB- Limitation of Actions , Law Com No 270 published in July 2001 , following on the consultation paper published in January 1998 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	395	Nevertheless the body of Court of Appeal authority which culminates in Hallam-Eames provides a reasonably clear and coherent test , and I see nothing in the legislative purpose of the Latent Damage Act 1986 , or in its scheme or language , to lead your Lordships ' House to depart from that line of authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	396	Nor is it necessary to do so , in my opinion , in order to dispose fairly of this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	397	67 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	398	In her article -LRB- p 236 -RRB- Janet O'Sullivan makes this comment : It is indeed a striking feature of the line of authority in the Court of Appeal that -LRB- with the modest exception of the reference in Hallam-Eames to cause for complaint -RRB- the Court has firmly rejected any language which suggests , even in the least technical terms , that some fault or mishap has occurred : see for instance Sir Thomas Bingham MR in Dobbie v Medway Health Authority -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 WLR 1234 at p1243 C-D , observing that the judge was open to criticism for using , not only the expression `` negligence '' , but also `` unnecessarily '' and `` something had gone wrong '' -LRB- the Master of the Rolls nevertheless expressed complete agreement with the judge 's conclusion -RRB- ; see also Steyn LJ at p1247H . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	399	I respectfully doubt whether the insistence on extremely non-judgmental language is required by section 14A -LRB- 9 -RRB- , and I think that it may in some cases ignore the realities of the situation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	400	I respectfully agree with the views expressed on this point by my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in paras 13 and 14 of his opinion . 	lord walker	lord nicholls	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	401	But in any event there is a distinction to be made between two matters : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the generality or specificity -LRB- see Nash v Eli Lilly -LSB- 1993 -RSB- 1 WLR 782 , 798-799 -RRB- of the language in which the essence of the claimant 's complaint is to be identified and expressed , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- the judgmentally colourful or non-judgmentally monochrome character of that language . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	402	So long as section 14A -LRB- 9 -RRB- is kept well in mind , the level of generality or specificity will often -LRB- as in this case -RRB- be the more important matter for the Court to address . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN

152	404	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	405	this is the first case on section 14A to reach your Lordships ' House , and it is therefore appropriate to address , as I have tried to do , the issues of principle which have been raised in argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	406	As I understand it there is little -LRB- if any -RRB- difference in the House as to the principles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN

152	409	In their amended particulars of claim the respondents pleaded that they had retained Fawcetts on two occasions : in September 1994 to investigate and advise on the acquisition of a controlling interest in the company which became Haward Agriculture Ltd -LRB- `` Agriculture '' -RRB- ; and from 9 December 1994 `` to assess -LSB- Agriculture 's -RSB- trading performance and to advise -LSB- the respondents -RSB- in respect of the same '' and in particular to review monthly accounting information . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	410	The first retainer is elaborately pleaded in paragraph 7 , as expanded by paragraphs 8 and 9 , and the second retainer is less elaborately pleaded in paragraphs 23 and 24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN

152	412	But assuming for the purposes of the limitation issue that all the allegations in the particulars of claim can be proved , I regard the essence of Fawcetts ' retainer as to give financial advice and assistance on the acquisition of a controlling interest in Agriculture , and on the subsequent state of that company 's business and further investment in it ; and the essence of the pleaded particulars of negligence -LRB- paragraph 43 -RRB- that Fawcetts failed to carry out their retainer properly , or -LRB- in some instances -RRB- failed to carry it out at all .

152	414	There was not in fact , in December 1994 , any purchase of shares in Agriculture by the respondents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	415	It seems that Mr Haward took up and paid for 60,000 newly-issued # 1 shares at par -LRB- although the schedule of damages attributes the share purchase to W J Haward Ltd -LRB- `` WJHL '' -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	416	Mr Haward became chairman of Agriculture and soon after , in May 1995 -LRB- when Mr and Mrs Rose resigned -RRB- he became company secretary also . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	417	During 1995 he seems to have acquired a further 19,714 shares by purchase , presumably from Mr and Mrs Rose or Mr Coleman -LRB- a sales director who resigned in July 1995 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	418	Mr Haward remained as chairman and company secretary throughout the period with which this appeal is concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	419	The respondents ' pleaded case is that during this period a sum of over # 1.5 m was advanced to Agriculture by way of loan from the respondents and was lost , although the last balance sheet in evidence -LRB- as at 31 December 1997 -RRB- shows a loan of about # 1.022 m from WJHL , and no loan from Mr Haward himself , or from the family trust , is apparent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	420	71 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	421	It is not however necessary to pursue these apparent discrepancies between the pleadings and the accounts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	422	The most salient points disclosed by the accounts are the figures for Agriculture 's turnover , losses and the state of its shareholders ' funds during the relevant period : # 000 72 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	423	Before the judge it seems to have been accepted that by 6 December 1998 at the very latest it was known to Mr Haward and the other respondents that the payments made to Agriculture -LRB- whether on taking up shares or as loans -RRB- were for practical purposes lost . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	424	This point was however in issue in the Court of Appeal -LRB- after a change of counsel on both sides -RRB- and it was also relied on -LRB- though not , I think , very strongly -RRB- before your Lordships . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	425	It seems to me that on this point the respondents are stuck with their own pleading , which asserts that the entire investment in Agriculture is recoverable as damages with interest from the respective dates of payment of each component part of the investment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	426	They are also faced with some indisputable facts which seem to have guided the judge to his conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	427	Mr Haward was a mature businessman , even though most of his work seems to have been practical work on building sites . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	428	He was chairman and company secretary of Agriculture throughout , and he regularly attended board meetings -LRB- at which Mr Austreng of Fawcetts was also present -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	429	He saw the accounts in draft and in their final form -LRB- indeed , he signed them -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	430	The judge was right to conclude that the respondents ' investment was completely lost by 6 December 1998 at the very latest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	431	Mr Haward also knew that it was -LRB- to adapt the language of Hoffmann LJ in Hallam-Eames -RRB- `` something of which -LSB- he -RSB- would prima facie seem entitled to complain . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	432	The outcome was very different from what he had expected when he acquired his controlling shareholding in 1994 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	433	73 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	434	I am therefore inclined to think that -LRB- although his judgment is not without some defects and difficulties -RRB- the judge was basically right in his overall conclusion -LRB- para 20 -RRB- : 74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	435	I do however think that the judge was wrong when he went on to say that he saw no material distinction between the present case and H F Pension Trustees Ltd v Ellison . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	436	That case was concerned with laymen 's understanding and appreciation of legal advice on a highly technical subject , that is , the exercise of fiduciary powers under occupational pension schemes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	437	This case is concerned with a mature businessman 's understanding of financial advice on the trading activities of a small company carrying on a fairly straightforward sort of business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	438	The relevant level of expertise is much lower . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	439	The judge made this point later in his judgment -LRB- at para 24 -RRB- : By this the judge did not of course mean that the accountants were obviously negligent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	440	What he meant was that if the pleaded allegations were proved at trial , causation would be no problem at trial -LRB- and by the same token he had no problem with the `` attributable '' condition -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	441	Conversely if the allegations were not proved at trial , it would be because the claimants ' loss from Agriculture 's undoubted and obvious failure would have been shown to have been caused , not by negligent advice -LRB- or lack of advice -RRB- , but by later events not foreseeable by a reasonably careful and competent financial adviser . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	442	But the judge had to assume that the allegations were capable of being proved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	443	75 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
152	444	Why then did the Court of Appeal reach a different conclusion ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	445	Jonathan Parker LJ embarked on a very lengthy analysis of the authorities , much of which I would respectfully agree with . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	446	But then in paragraph 168 he made these observations : The relevant paragraphs of the letter were as follows : - The Lord Justice went on to conclude that it was not until May 1999 that Mr Haward acquired knowledge of acts or omissions by Fawcetts which were causally relevant for the purposes of his allegations of negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	447	76 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	448	I can not , with respect , follow this reasoning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	449	The respondents ' pleaded case was that they had lost large sums of money invested in Agriculture . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	450	They lost that money because Agriculture became hopelessly insolvent and no one was prepared to throw any more good money after bad . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	451	The calamitous failure of the business no doubt had many causes , probably including all the factors mentioned in the letter quoted above . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	452	But the respondents ' pleaded case was that Fawcetts had failed to perform their professional duty and that this was legally causative of the respondents ' loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	453	Whether their case will succeed at trial , if it comes to trial , will depend on the judge 's findings as to what the scope of the duty really was ; whether Fawcetts performed it properly ; and whether -LRB- or to what extent -RRB- the failure of the business -LRB- and the consequent loss of the respondents ' investment -RRB- was caused by unpredictable factors which no reasonable professional person could have been expected to take into account in his advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	454	The need to investigate and determine these issues at trial can not alter the identification of `` the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	455	It might have been different if -LRB- for instance -RRB- the respondents had engaged one professional to investigate and advise on the company 's books , another professional to investigate and advise on the competence and honesty of the company 's existing and proposed workforce -LRB- including Mr Brunt -RRB- , and yet another professional to investigate and advise on the general state of the agricultural machinery market in the west country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	456	But that is not this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	457	77 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	458	For these reasons I think that Jonathan Parker LJ erred in equating Mr Haward 's position to that of the claimant in Ali v Courtaulds Textiles Ltd -LSB- 1999 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep Med 301 and that of the imaginary claimant described by Sir Thomas Bingham MR in Dobbie v Medway Health Authority -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 WLR 1234 , 1240 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	459	In those two cases the claimant did not know whether his physical disablement was attributable to his working conditions , for which his employer was responsible , or to some more or less natural cause such as ageing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	460	He was therefore in a state of ignorance on a fundamental point , and his ignorance could be dispelled only by a medical expert . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	461	I see no useful parallel with Mr Haward 's situation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	462	The relationship between a man 's working conditions and his natural ageing as competing causative elements in his deafness is quite different , to my mind , from the relationship between a financial adviser 's alleged professional incompetence and the various factors which eventually lead to the collapse of the business on which he advises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	463	78 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	464	At the end of his judgment the judge referred -LRB- as I understand it , for completeness only -RRB- to evidence and submissions as to when the respondents first knew that they had a claim against Fawcetts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	465	Mr Pooles QC -LRB- for the respondents -RRB- made some telling criticisms of this evidence , especially a draft letter dated 8 December 1998 -LRB- but never sent -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	466	But I regard these criticisms as irrelevant because the whole of this discussion was directed to the wrong question : knowledge of the existence of a claim in negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	467	The whole of the respondents ' written evidence -LRB- witness statements by Mr Haward himself , Mr Taylor and Mr Quinney -RRB- was directed to this -LRB- irrelevant -RRB- question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	468	Thus the relevant part of Mr Haward 's witness statement was headed in bold , `` When I first became aware that I might have a claim against Fawcetts '' , and this is the theme reiterated in paragraphs 26 , 28 , 29 , 30 and 31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	469	The date when the respondents knew that they had a worthwhile cause of action against Fawcetts was not the starting date within the meaning of the statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	470	79 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	471	The respondents ' last-ditch argument , as I see it , is that even if the respondents knew of the loss and knew what advice Fawcetts had or had not given , they did not know the reasons why Fawcetts had not given the right advice -- for instance , whether it was because Mr Austreng had not gone into the books thoroughly enough , or had failed to verify trading stocks , or had failed to draw the obvious conclusions from information which was available to him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	472	But the judge considered this point and dismissed it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	473	He said -LRB- para 21 -RRB- , The importance of isolating what is essential has of course been emphasised in later authority to which I have already referred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	474	80 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	475	I see nothing wrong with the judge 's assessment of this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	476	It does not seem to have received any attention in the Court of Appeal -LRB- see the fairly full summary of counsel 's submissions in paras 131-144 of the judgment of Jonathan Parker LJ -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	477	Nor does it appear in the respondents ' printed case in your Lordships ' House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	478	I would treat it as rightly abandoned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	479	To require that a claimant had a detailed knowledge of how and why the defendant failed in his duty of care -LRB- for instance , why in Hallam-Eames the managing agents had plunged so deeply into the US casualty market -RRB- would go beyond the settled principles mentioned in paras 10 and 11 of Lord Nicholls ' opinion , and would tilt the balance too far in favour of dilatory claimants . 	lord walker	lord nicholls	partagr	0.6	NAN

152	486	I am grateful to my noble and learned friends Lord Scott of Foscote , Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe and Lord Mance for their very full exposition of the facts of this appeal , the statutory provisions in play and the many authorities in this difficult area of law . 	lord brown	lord mance	factagr	0.6	NAN
152	487	This enables me to state my own opinion in the matter quite shortly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	488	83 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	489	Shorn of all detail -- indeed , simplified to the very limits of accuracy -- the facts are these . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	490	In December 1994 Mr Haward acquired for # 60,000 a controlling interest in an agricultural machinery company which he knew from the outset would require the injection of a further # 100,000 or so before it turned to profitability but which in the event , despite the injection of some # 431,000 in 1995 , some # 102,000 in 1996 , some # 509,000 in 1997 and some # 208,000 in 1998 , failed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	491	Throughout the whole course of this disastrous enterprise Mr Haward had been advised by Fawcetts , a firm of accountants which had acted for him and his family since 1958 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	492	By , at latest , 6 December 1998 -LRB- three years before he issued proceedings against Fawcetts and thus the date at which Mr Haward 's knowledge falls to be considered for the purposes of section 14A of the Limitation Act 1980 -RRB- Mr Haward knew that these sums had become lost to him : the company was hopelessly insolvent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	493	He believed , however , that his losses were to be explained , not by any deficiency in the advice he had received when making his investments but rather by a variety of damaging economic factors : initially adverse trading conditions such as the general agricultural recession and the effect of BSE , and later by a number of detrimental activities on the part of the company 's sales director . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	494	It was not until May 1999 that Mr Haward for the first time began to question the soundness of Fawcetts ' investment advice and only then did the investigations start which finally led to the issue of a negligence claim against them in December 2001 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	495	84 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	496	It is in these circumstances that the central question arises : at what date did Mr Haward know that `` the damage was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence '' within the meaning of section 14A -LRB- 8 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the 1980 Act ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	497	If it was before 6 December 1998 , section 14A can not avail Mr Haward : his claim would then be restricted to the damage he sustained after 6 December 1995 -LRB- six years before the issue of proceedings , the primary limitation period -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	498	If , however , it was after 6 December 1998 , then he can benefit from section 14A 's alternative three-year period of limitation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	499	This preliminary point accordingly concerns Mr Haward 's initial investment of # 60,000 made in 1994 and the further advances of some # 431,000 made in 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	500	85 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	501	`` The damage '' for the purposes of section 14A -LRB- 8 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- is `` the damage in respect of which damages are claimed '' within the meaning of section 14A -LRB- 6 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- which I take to mean the loss of the sums invested : a loss , as already stated , which was known to Mr Haward at latest by December 1998 and the loss for which he seeks compensation in his claim for damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	502	When , however , did Mr Haward know that this loss was `` attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence '' ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	503	That is the critical question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	504	86 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	505	Is it enough that Mr Haward knew , as plainly he did , that Fawcetts advised him that this was a sound and suitable investment -LRB- both initially and as to the subsequent advancement of further funds to the company -RRB- and that it was on the basis of this advice that he went ahead with it ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	506	Or did he need to know more than that and , if so , what more ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	507	Clearly , for time to start running , he did not have to know that Fawcetts had , as a matter of law , acted negligently in the giving of their advice -- see section 14A -LRB- 9 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	508	On the facts of this case the question ultimately seems to me to come down to this : to set time running did Mr Haward need to know not only that the investment was made on Fawcetts ' advice but also that that advice had not been based on the kind of investigations which must necessarily be undertaken before any such advice can be reliably tendered ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	509	87 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	510	As Lord Mance has pointed out , were Fawcetts able to rely upon section 14A -LRB- 10 -RRB- to assert constructive knowledge on Mr Haward 's part , their case here would be a strong one even if the knowledge required was of their failure to make a preliminary investigation into the company before the advice to acquire it was given . 	lord brown	lord mance	partagr	0.6	NAN
152	511	Having regard to the huge scale of his losses from the outset , Mr Haward ought surely to have sought expert advice and set in train the consideration of a possible claim against Fawcetts long before he did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	512	Given , however , that Fawcetts ' case is based solely on Mr Haward 's actual knowledge , to my mind it must fail if anything more is required than that Mr Haward knew that his loss might well have resulted from an investment made on Fawcetts ' advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	513	88 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	514	Having , I confess , changed my mind upon the point , I have finally come to the conclusion that nothing more is needed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	515	I had earlier been attracted to the view that the analogy here was with Dobbie v Medway Health Authority -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 WLR 1234 , as thereafter analysed in Hallam-Eames v Merrett Syndicates -LRB- 1995 -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep PN 178 : unless and until Mrs Dobbie knew that her removed breast had in fact been healthy , time would not start running against her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	516	So too here , it has been suggested : until the investment was known not merely to have been lost but to have been intrinsically unsound when made -LRB- i.e. an ill-judged and ill-advised investment from the outset rather merely than one which proved unsuccessful as a result of subsequent events -RRB- time should not run . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	517	I have come to recognise , however , a critical difference between the two cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	518	In Dobbie 's case what was unknown was not the attributability of the damage to the defendant 's act but rather the very fact of damage : Mrs Dobbie would clearly have suffered none had her removed breast in fact been unhealthy ; she would have been better off without it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	519	Similarly , as Lord Walker has explained , H F Pension Trustees Limited v Ellison -LSB- 1999 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep PN 489 should have been differently decided , not because of any doubts about attributability but rather on the basis that the trustees there did not know that they had suffered any damage until they learned of the impropriety of the payments made and the consequent likelihood of tax losses . 	lord brown	lord walker	partagr	0.6	NAN
152	520	In both those cases , however , there could have been no question but that , once the fact of damage was known to the respective claimants , time started running . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	521	It was not necessary for Mrs Dobbie also to have known that the reason her healthy breast had been removed was because the surgeon had failed first to carry out a sufficient examination of the lump to be satisfied of its malignancy ; nor would it have been necessary for the trustees in the pension case to have known what underlay the incorrect advice they had received when making the payments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	522	89 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	523	Here , by contrast with those two cases , it is now common ground that Mr Haward knew that he had suffered the relevant damage by the material date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
152	524	Fawcetts ' advice was more than merely the sine qua non of that loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	525	There is no parallel here with Hoffmann LJ 's illustration in Hallam-Eames of the member 's agent taking the Name to lunch and persuading him to join Lloyd 's where he then suffered losses -- an event which would clearly not have been causally relevant in the context of an allegation of negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	526	90 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	527	What the claimant must know to set time running is the essence of the act or omission to which his damage is attributable , the substance of what ultimately comes to be pleaded as his case in negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	528	That essence or substance here could no doubt be characterised in either of two ways : either as the act of recommending investment in the company -LRB- or omitting to caution against it -- on the particular parts of this case these are two sides of the same coin -RRB- , or , with greater particularity , the act of recommending investment without first carrying out the investigations necessary to justify such positive advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	529	Having at first preferred the latter characterisation , I have come to prefer the former . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	530	True , under the former the claimant knows nothing beyond the fact that his advisers led him into what turned out to be a bad investment ; he does not know , as under the latter characterisation he would , that he has a justifiable complaint against his advisers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	531	But he surely knows enough -LRB- constructive knowledge aside -RRB- to realize that there is a real possibility of his damage having been caused by some flaw or inadequacy in his advisers ' investment advice , and enough therefore to start an investigation into that possibility , which section 14A then gives him three years to complete . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	532	91 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	533	If the other approach is adopted , time only starts to run once the claimant recognises that a fuller examination of the company 's prospects should have been carried out than was in fact carried out , knowledge which Mr Haward only learned here at some unascertained date after the investigation into Fawcetts ' conduct had itself begun in May 1999 -LRB- when another accountant first suggested to Mr Haward that a negligence claim might lie against Fawcetts -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	534	But what if that suggestion and the investigation which it prompted had themselves been made at a later date still , perhaps very substantially later ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	535	On this approach the limitation period would appear capable of almost limitless extension and for no sufficient reason : unlike the position in Pirelli General Cable Works Ltd v Oscar Faber & Partners -LSB- 1983 -RSB- 2 AC 1 -- the decision which precipitated what is now section 14A of the 1980 Act -- there is nothing latent here about the damage or , indeed , about the identity of the prospective defendant .

152	543	Under s. 2 of the Limitation Act 1980 , the basic period within which a claimant must bring a cause of action for negligence is six years from the date when the cause of action accrued . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	544	S. 14A provides , as its heading states , a `` special time limit for negligence actions where facts relevant to cause of action are not known at date of accrual '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	545	The period under s. 14A -LRB- 4 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- and -LRB- 5 -RRB- for bringing an action for damages for negligence is three years from the date when the claimant first had `` the knowledge required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the relevant damage '' , where that period expires later than a period of six years from the date when the cause of action accrued .

152	557	The claim in outline 96 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	558	In the present case the three claimants are Mr Haward , W. J. Haward Limited , a family firm of building contractors established in 1902 and under Mr Haward 's control since his father 's death in 1992 , and W. J. Haward Family Trust No. 1 , a family trust of which the trustees were Mr Haward and , until 1999 , Mr Trevor Austreng of the defendants , Fawcetts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	559	The focus for limitation purposes is on Mr Haward 's knowledge , which it is agreed the other two claimants are to be treated as sharing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	560	The claimants allege that Fawcetts , accountants acting as their advisers , were negligent in relation to advice given or not given both in late 1994 and at subsequent dates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	561	They allege that , in reliance on such advice , on 9th December 1994 Mr Haward acquired for # 60,000 a 60 % shareholding in Kings Stag Engineering Limited -LRB- which changed its name in 1995 to Haward Agriculture Limited and which I shall call HAL throughout -RRB- , and the Trust No. 1 acquired for # 100,000 the leasehold of HAL 's premises , and at later dates Mr Haward made substantial further investments in or loans to HAL , using monies advanced to him by the second claimant company . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	562	97 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	563	A business plan for 1995 was prepared before the acquisition of HAL , upon which plan it is alleged that Fawcetts were instructed to advise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	564	The plan included this optimistic assessment : The plan contemplated that only # 106,745 would need to be advanced to HAL during 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	565	In the event , the sums advanced by the end of 1995 totalled # 431,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	566	The business plan contemplated a loss in that accounting year of # 5,520 , whereas the loss in the event totalled # 266,340 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	567	Further loans were made in 1996 totalling # 102,985 and in 1997 totalling # 509,525 , and HAL made net losses in those years of # 27,276 and # 400,062 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	568	The general picture therefore during this period was one of repeated , unexpected requirements for cash injections . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	569	The annual directors ' reports for HAL , prepared for signature by Mr Austreng , remained nevertheless optimistic that the company would turn round . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	570	The report for 1995 , signed on 29th October 1996 , said that : As this report records , HAL had been afflicted by difficult trading conditions , which included a general market decline , the BSE crisis and the strong pound . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	571	In mid-1998 issues also emerged about the conduct of its affairs by its day-to-day manager , Mr Brunt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	572	By 6th December 1998 , the judge found , Mr Haward knew that `` the payments already made had gone '' and had become effectively or at least largely a loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	573	This loss represents the damage which the claimants now claim to have been attributable to negligent advice on Fawcetts ' part regarding investment in HAL . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	574	98 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	575	The agreed Statement of Facts and Issues put before the House records in paragraph 18 that However , the Statement goes on to identify as critical issues in this case : `` What did Mr Haward need to know in order to know , per s. 14A -LRB- 8 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Act , that ` the damage was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence ' ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	576	and , secondly , `` what in this case is/are the acts or omissions which is/are alleged to constitute negligence ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	577	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	578	From this , it is clear that the claimants put in issue whether knowledge of the bare matters asserted in paragraph 18 -LRB- of which Mr Haward on any view knew , at least as regards advice actually given -RRB- was to be equated with knowledge of the acts or omissions now alleged by them to constitute negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	579	99 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	580	Consistently with this , both before the judge in argument at first instance and before your Lordships , the claimants ' submissions have referred to complaints that Fawcetts did not do their `` homework '' before advising the claimants in favour of the acquisition of , and the further investments in , HAL and/or in failing to advise them against further investments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	581	In a note written to the judge with the consent of counsel for Fawcetts after the oral hearing , counsel for the claimants argued that , in addition to knowing that advice had been given or not given , Mr Haward `` must at least have known that the advice or absence of advice was on the basis of inadequate investigation '' , although counsel accepted that it was not necessary to know `` the detailed allegations with regard to what due diligence exercises or audits should have been undertaken '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	582	Finally , the claimants ' written Case before your Lordships describes the complaint in paragraph 14 as being that there was `` inadequate consideration of the underlying state of the Business by -LSB- Fawcetts -RSB- both prior to and following the purchase '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	583	Eliminating as far as possible any suggestion of negligence or fault , the claimants ' claim may on this basis , in my view , be broadly categorised as being for loss flowing from advice or absence of advice in circumstances where Fawcetts had not done certain preparatory work or given any or full consideration to information available to them , and as a result did not identify -LRB- or therefore advise about -RRB- problems in HAL 's affairs and accounts , affecting the soundness from the outset of HAL and investments made in HAL . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	584	In short , omissions on Fawcetts ' part led them to an unsound assessment and inappropriate advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	585	100 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	586	The amended particulars of claim include detailed allegations of negligence which are to similar effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	587	Thus , they complain in paragraph 18 that Fawcetts failed `` properly to carry out due diligence '' in respect of HAL prior to 9th December 1994 , in that they 101 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	588	The first three points go to matters which it is said that Fawcetts should have discovered from materials available to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	589	The final point must have been obvious , and must no doubt be read in conjunction with the previous complaints about Fawcetts ' failure to ascertain HAL 's real financial position from work they should have done and material they saw or should have seen and on the basis of which , it is said , they should have advised the claimants or advised them differently . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	590	It is said that , had Fawcetts fulfilled their duties of skill and care , and as a result advised the claimants properly , HAL would not have been acquired or acquired on the same basis and further investments and loans would not have been made in HAL and to HAL after its acquisition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	591	102 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	592	The basic six year period for any claim for damages in tort in respect of the acquisition of , or any subsequent investment in , HAL expired six years after such acquisition or investment -LRB- cf Forster v. Outred -LSB- 1982 -RSB- 1 WLR 86 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	593	Any claim in contract would also be time-barred by then , if not earlier . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	594	Proceedings were issued on 6th December 2001 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	595	So , in response to the claim , Fawcetts pleaded that any claims for breaches of contractual duty occurring , and any tortious claims for losses accruing , prior to 6th December 1995 were statute barred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	596	In reply , the claimants pleaded that the earliest date on which they had the knowledge referred to in subsection -LRB- 5 -RRB- of s. 14A of the 1980 Act was 17th December 1999 -LRB- a date modified in oral submissions to May 1999 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	597	Pursuant to an order made on 26th November 2002 by Master Leslie , the issues of limitation were tried as preliminary issues before HHJ Playford QC , who decided them in favour of Fawcetts on 15th April 2003 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	598	The Court of Appeal -LRB- Potter LJ , Jonathan Parker LJ and Charles J -RRB- allowed the claimants ' appeal on 11th March 2004 , and the House gave leave to appeal on 14th July 2004 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	599	103 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	600	On one view , HHJ Playford considered that the only knowledge required of the claimants was knowledge that -LRB- a -RRB- sums were invested ; -LRB- b -RRB- that the investments were made either with or without the defendants ' advice ; and -LRB- c -RRB- that the investments so made had become lost ; and that all such matters were patent , while everything else was either a mere particular of negligence -LRB- as he described the allegation of failure to do the necessary homework -RRB- or a matter of law irrelevant under subsection -LRB- 9 -RRB- of s. 14A . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	601	HHJ Playford said that it was Earlier in the same paragraph in his judgment HHJ Playford said : He did not however elaborate on what he meant by the `` causal connection '' which he thought was `` patent '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	602	If -LRB- as I am inclined to think -RRB- all he meant was that it was clear that , but for whatever advice was or was not given , the investments would never have been made and so would never have been lost , that involved , as I shall show , a significant error regarding the statutory test for limitation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	603	At the end of his judgment , HHJ Playford went on `` for the sake of completeness only '' to consider the claimants ' factual case that they had no knowledge that they had any claim against Fawcetts until 1999 , and found that the claimants had not discharged the burden on them to establish this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	604	He also recorded that no question of constructive knowledge had been argued before him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
152	605	104 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	606	The Court of Appeal took a different view on the law and the facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	607	After a full review of authority , Jonathan Parker LJ concluded that s. 14A is concerned with knowledge of facts , rather than law , that the claimants ' allegations of negligence were relevant under subsection 8 -LRB- a -RRB- as identifying the acts or omissions claimed to have caused the loss or damage in respect of which damages are sought , and that `` knowledge '' in s. 14A means `` know with sufficient confidence to justify embarking on the preliminaries to the issue of a writ '' , while `` attributable ... to '' in subsection 8 -LRB- a -RRB- means `` capable of being attributed to '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	608	On the facts , Jonathan Parker LJ pointed to other `` possible causes for the failure of the company '' , notably uncertainties over the future of farm income , the effect of BSE and the strong pound , as well as the alleged activities of a director , Mr Brunt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	609	He took as a finding of fact , and himself also endorsed , a statement by HHJ Playford in his judgment that the claimants ' investigation into a possible causal link between their losses and Fawcetts ' advice or lack of it `` did not even commence until May 1999 '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	610	On that basis , he concluded that Mr Haward and hence the other claimants `` did not acquire the requisite actual knowledge prior to 6 December 1998 '' -LRB- paragraph 170 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	611	He recorded at paragraphs 86 and 143-4 that Fawcetts had sought , by respondents ' notice and in oral submissions , to raise issues of constructive knowledge on Mr Haward 's part under s. 14A -LRB- 10 -RRB- , but he refused at paragraphs 170-171 to entertain any such issue , because it was not investigated and no cross-examination was directed to it at trial before HHJ Playford . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	612	Potter LJ agreed with Jonathan Parker LJ 's analysis of authority and conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	613	Charles J also agreed , adding that in his view the act or omission alleged to constitute Fawcetts ' negligence was not simply their advice , but rather that there were causes of the continuing losses and increasing deficit `` which existed and should have been identified by Fawcetts at the times that the relevant purchase and investments were made '' , but of which the claimants did not become aware until May 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	614	105 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	615	Before your Lordships Fawcetts as appellants have not sought to rely on any suggestion of constructive knowledge under s. 14A -LRB- 10 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	616	The case is thus a special , and I would think unusual , one , concerned only with the issue of Mr Haward 's actual knowledge of the matters referred to in s. 14A . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	617	The law 106 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	618	Under s. 14A the onus is on a claimant to plead and prove that he first had the knowledge required for bringing his action within a period of three years prior to its bringing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	619	Subsection -LRB- 6 -RRB- of s. 14A distinguishes two aspects of the knowledge required . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	620	The first aspect relates to the seriousness of the damage , the second to `` the other facts relevant to the current action '' including in particular that such damage was attributable in whole or part to the act or omission alleged to constitute negligence and the identity of the defendant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	621	The seriousness of the damage is relevant because there may be cases where , although it is known that loss has been suffered due to the negligence of another person , the loss may appear for a time so minor that no-one would contemplate instituting proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	622	That is I think more likely in the area of personal injuries and fatal accidents , covered by s. 14 on which s. 14A -LRB- 7 -RRB- to -LRB- 10 -RRB- were modelled , than in the area covered by s. 14A itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	623	In both areas , the statutory language assumes that it is known that there has been some injury -LRB- under s. 14 -RRB- or damage -LRB- under s. 14A -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	624	But this too can give rise to difficulty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	625	If a doctor advises that it is necessary to operate , or to remove a breast , in order to remove a malignant tumour , one would not usually speak of the patient sustaining an injury until one knew that the diagnosis was misconceived and there was no such tumour . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	626	Similarly , if a financial adviser advises in favour of an investment , one would not describe the making of the investment itself as `` damage '' until one discovered that it had been a bad or unsound investment from the outset . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	627	107 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	628	In such cases , there is an inter-play between knowledge of what would ordinarily be regarded as injury or damage and knowledge regarding the factual circumstances in which the operation or investment occurred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	629	Yet , the first aspect of the knowledge required relates to damage of sufficient seriousness `` to justify -LSB- the claimant -RSB- instituting proceedings '' , whereas the knowledge required regarding the attributability of such damage to some act or omission of the defendants is , as will appear , not necessarily such knowledge as to justify proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	630	To maintain a coherent scheme , the better view therefore appears to be to treat the first aspect of knowledge as relating solely to matters of quantum and all questions regarding the evaluation or classification of damage as such as falling within the second aspect of the knowledge required . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	631	This is also the view taken in authority : see Dobbie v. Medway Health Authority -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 WLR 1234 , 1241G-1242A , per Sir Thomas Bingham MR. In the present case , the judge said that Mr Haward knew by 6th December 1998 that at any rate part of the large investments which had been made in HAL would not be recovered and had become lost , whatever happened to HAL . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	632	But that is not the same as saying that he knew that the investments were bad from the outset . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	633	108 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	634	The second aspect of knowledge required under s. 14A is that the damage was attributable in whole or part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	635	It is clear from both the heading and language of s. 14A that this aspect deals with difficulties facing a claimant separate from those which are presented by cases where the fact or quantum of damage itself is latent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	636	The background to s. 14A confirms this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	637	The 20th Report of the Law Reform Committee of May 1974 -LRB- Cmnd . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	638	5630 -RRB- led to the definition of knowledge in personal injury cases in the Limitation Act 1975 , which became by consolidation s. 14 of the Limitation Act 1980 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	639	In paragraphs 42 , 49 and 54-55 , the Law Reform Committee treated the two aspects as independent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	640	In particular in paragraph 49 it said : 109 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	641	The Committee went on to consider whether there should be any further requirement that the plaintiff should know that he had a worthwhile cause of action , or -LRB- taking an intermediate possibility suggested , uniquely , by Lord Pearson in Central Asbestos v. Dodd -LSB- 1973 -RSB- AC 518 -RRB- that he should at least be aware that his injury was attributable to some fault of the defendant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	642	They rejected both possibilities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	643	At paragraph 55 , they therefore accepted as -LRB- they believed -RRB- `` a date capable of precise definition and not presenting any particular difficulties of proof '' the date `` when the plaintiff has knowledge , actual or constructive , both of his injured condition and of its having been caused by acts or omissions of the defendant '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	644	In the later Law Reform Committee 's 24th Report -LRB- Latent Damage -RRB- of November 1984 , which led to the insertion by the Latent Damage Act 1986 of s. 14A , applying to cases of negligence not involving personal injury , the Committee at paragraph 4.7 preferred to model s. 14A on s. 14 , rather than on s. 11 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Prescription and Limitation Act -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1973 , because it was arguable that s. 11 -LRB- 3 -RRB- 110 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	645	The reference in parenthesis to awareness of causation being `` sometimes ... difficult to ascertain in a latent damage context '' can not mean that the Committee intended that it should only be where damage remained latent that knowledge of causation was to be relevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	646	Indeed , so long as damage remains latent , knowledge regarding causation can not really arise as a problem . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	647	Another point in this Report which it is of interest to note is the Committee 's recognition at the end of paragraph 4.7 - in contrast with the optimism of the 1974 Report - that an approach adapted from s. 14 `` does have its disadvantages too '' and `` is a complicated formulation '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	648	111 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	649	Under the terms of s. 14A -LRB- 8 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- , it is relevant to consider what is meant by -LRB- i -RRB- `` knowledge '' , -LRB- ii -RRB- `` the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence '' and -LRB- iii -RRB- knowledge that damage was `` attributable '' to such an act or omission .

152	652	The degree of certainty of knowledge required under s. 14 was considered by Purchas LJ giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Nash v. Eli Lilly -LRB- at p. 792C-D and also p. 796C-D . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	653	At p 791G-H Purchas LJ also quoted the conclusion of Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR in Halford v. Brookes -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 428 , 443 , that knowledge here `` clearly does not mean ` know for certain and beyond possibility of contradiction ' '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	654	Purchas LJ proceeded at p 792 C-D `` on the basis that knowledge is a condition of mind which imports a degree of certainty and that the degree of certainty which is appropriate for this purpose is that which , for the particular plaintiff , may reasonably be regarded as sufficient to justify embarking upon the preliminaries to the making of a claim for compensation such as the taking of legal or other advice '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	655	In Broadley v. Guy Clapham & Co. -LSB- 1993 -RSB- 4 Med LR 328 , 334 , Hoffmann LJ re-phrased the purpose of s. 14 -LRB- 1 -RRB- as being `` to determine the moment at which the plaintiff knows enough to make it reasonable for him to begin to investigate whether or not he has a case against the defendant '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	656	This was taken up by Brooke LJ in another case under s. 14 , Spargo v. North Essex District Health Authority -LSB- 1997 -RSB- PIQR P235 , P242 , where he said : 113 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	657	Turning to the phrase `` the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence '' , the word `` constitute '' is in my view significant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	658	It indicates that the claimant must know the factual essence of what is subsequently alleged as negligence in the claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	659	Once such knowledge has been acquired , it is under subs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	660	-LRB- 9 -RRB- irrelevant whether or not the claimant knew that the relevant act or omission `` did or did not , as a matter of law , involve negligence '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	661	So , there must be knowledge of the act or omission allegedly constituting negligence , but there need not be knowledge that , as a matter of law , such act or omission involved negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	662	Whether an act or omission involves negligence is a matter of law for the court , even though a court may of course hear a good deal of evidence -LRB- e.g. about accountancy principles and practices -RRB- in order to determine it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	663	Evidence of relevant accountancy principles or practices will commonly be deployed on the issue whether , as a matter of law , such act or omission involved negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	664	The difficulty is that knowledge of such principles or practices may also in some cases be said to bear on the question whether a person suffering loss would attribute such loss to accountants who had advised or not advised him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	665	114 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	666	As Charles J rightly observed , there are tensions arising from the inter-action of subs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

152	669	Under subs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	670	-LRB- 9 -RRB- if a claimant knows the relevant circumstances , it is irrelevant that he does not appreciate that they , as a matter of law , involve negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	671	And the history of the legislation , which I have already recited , shows that the aim was also to eliminate awareness of fault from the knowledge required . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	672	Yet in everyday life we may only be prepared to attribute responsibility if and when we appreciate what ought normally or properly to have happened , and so it is not surprising the authorities contain not only clear statements in line with the Law Reform Committee 's intention in its 20th report , but also statements showing the difficulty of avoiding terminology which has some flavour of fault-based thinking . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	673	115 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	674	This problem , which can arise most acutely in relation to omissions in professional negligence cases , is closely examined by Janet O'Sullivan in Limitation , latent damage and solicitors ' negligence -LRB- 2004 -RRB- 20 Journal of Professional Negligence 218 , 233-244 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	675	It is , as she shows , most acute in a case of alleged negligence on the part of a solicitor or other adviser , where the negligence consists simply in omitting to do something which it was the adviser 's duty in law to do -LRB- or in doing something that it was his duty not to do -RRB- and where the only reason why the client does not attribute any resulting damage to the adviser is that he does not know that the adviser would have been expected so to do -LRB- or not to do -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	676	Even in such a case , Hart & Honoré , in Causation in the Law -LRB- 2nd Ed . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	677	p. 38 , demonstrate that the concepts of causation -LRB- dependent on knowing what is factually usual -RRB- and reprehensibility -LRB- central to the concept of breach of duty -RRB- are conceptually distinct , although on the particular facts coincident . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	678	116 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	679	Whatever the position in such case , it is in any event not on all fours with a case where an adviser causes or allows a client to enter into a transaction but the client has no reason to attribute loss suffered in the transaction to his adviser until he discovers that the transaction was from the outset intrinsically unsound . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
152	680	In such a case there is authority that knowledge that the transaction was from the outset unsound -LRB- giving rise to a prima facie right to complain -RRB- may be distinguished from the -LRB- under s. 14A -LRB- 9 -RRB- irrelevant -RRB- knowledge that the adviser was negligent : see Hallam-Eames v.

152	682	The distinction may in such a case be narrow , as Hoffmann LJ giving the judgment of the court himself recognised at p. 181 -LRB- right column -RRB- in that case and as Janet O'Sullivan points out in her article at p. 236 , but it is an important , and I think a just , one .

152	686	-LRB- 9 -RRB- of knowledge , as a matter of law , that such facts involve negligence mean that the decision in HF Pension Trustees Ltd. v. Ellison -LSB- 1999 -RSB- Ll.R . Prof. Neg . 489 was correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	687	The court there treated the impermissibility of transfers , which resulted from advice given by the defendants , as a matter of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	688	In my view , this impermissiblity should , in context , have been regarded as an -LRB- unknown -RRB- fact - an aspect of the acts or omissions alleged to constitute negligence - or possibly -LRB- as my noble and learned friend Lord Walker has suggested -RRB- as unknown damage resulting from such acts or omissions . 	lord mance	lord walker	partagr	0.9	NAN
152	689	In either case , it should not have been until the impermissibility was known to the claimants that time started running against them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	690	The distinction between fact and law has never been that rigid -LRB- cf e.g Cooper v. Phibbs -LRB- 1867 -RRB- LR 2 HL 149 and , in the present field , the decision of Judge Raymond Jack QC , as he then was , in Perry v. Moysey -LSB- 1998 -RSB- PNLR 657 -RRB- , while subs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	691	-LRB- 9 -RRB- of s. 14A goes no further than to make irrelevant knowledge that acts or omissions involved negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	692	118 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	693	For present purposes what matters is that it is , in my opinion , wrong to suggest that all a claimant needs to know is that he has received professional advice but for which he would not have acted in a particular way which has given rise to loss , or that he has not received advice when , if he had received it , he would have acted in a way which would avoided such loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	694	The defendants ' primary contention to that effect was , I think , accepted by the judge at first instance -LRB- cf paragraph 103 above -RRB- , and was advanced again before the House by counsel for Fawcetts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	695	But it is , in my view , untenable , and could lead to unjust results . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	696	Mere `` but for '' causation is insufficient . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	697	This was pointed out by Hoffmann LJ in Hallam-Eames v. Merrett Syndicates -LSB- 2001 -RSB- Ll.R . Prof. Neg . 178 , 181 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	698	The decision in that case illustrates the point , since it was not the writing of the run off policies or of the reinsurances to close -LRB- `` RITCs '' -RRB- or the certification by the auditors of the accounts which were alone regarded as the acts or omissions alleged to constitute the negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	699	Rather it was those facts plus the fact that they exposed the Names to potentially huge liabilities -LRB- and in the case of the accounts also attributed values to incurred but not reported losses - `` IBNRs '' -RRB- none of which were capable of reasonable quantification : see especially at p. 181 -LRB- top right and the whole left column -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	700	A claimant who has received apparently sound and reliable advice may see no reason to challenge it unless and until he discovers that it has not been preceded by or based on the investigation which he instructed or expected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	701	A claimant who has suffered financial loss in a transaction entered into in reliance on such advice may not attribute such loss to the advice unless and until he either makes the like discovery about the inadequacy of the work done , or at least discovers some respect in which the transaction was from the outset unsound giving him -LRB- as Hoffmann LJ said -RRB- prima facie cause to complain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	702	Such a scenario may well occur where there are other causes of loss which appear to him capable of explaining the whole loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	703	119 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	704	On the other hand , as counsel for the claimants accepted in his note to the judge -LRB- paragraph 99 above -RRB- , a claimant can not postpone the running of time almost indefinitely by reference to detailed factual points which often only become known in the course of investigation of a possible claim , or during litigation itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	705	The Court of Appeal was right in Broadley v. Guy Clapham & Co. to disapprove a test adopted by Hirst J in Bentley v. Bristol & Weston Health Authority -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 2 Med LR 359 , in so far as it would have required a claimant to know all factual matters necessary to establish negligence or to draft a fully and comprehensively particularised claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	706	120 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	707	The authorities have thus adopted as the relevant test when the claimant acquired `` knowledge of the essence of the act or omission to which the injury is attributable '' : see Nash v. Eli Lilly & Co. -LSB- 1993 -RSB- 1 WLR 782 , 799C per Purchas LJ and Hallam-Eames v. Merrett Syndicates -LSB- 2001 -RSB- Ll.R . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	708	178 , 181 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	709	The Court of Appeal in Hallam-Eames thus distinguished between , on the one hand , `` elaborating the detail by requiring knowledge of precisely how he had come to do the act complained of '' -LRB- which is irrelevant -RRB- and , on the other , knowledge of facts which are `` part of the essence of -LSB- the -RSB- complaint '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	710	An example given of the latter was the fact in Dobbie v. Medway Health Authority -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 WLR 1234 that the breast removed by the surgeon had been healthy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	711	In Hallam-Eames , the essential facts of which knowledge was required were of a reverse character - viz that the run-off policies and reinsurances to close and the certified accounts were in effect unsound -LRB- or `` unhealthy '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	712	Hoffmann LJ explained : He -LSB- the claimant -RSB- must have known the facts which can fairly be described as constituting the negligence of which he complains . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

152	714	Hoffmann LJ continued : 122 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	715	The third element is what is meant by damage being `` attributable '' in whole or part to the act or omission allegedly constituting negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	716	The authorities establish that the word `` attributable '' means here `` capable of being attributed '' , rather than `` caused by '' : Guidera v. N.E.I. Projects -LRB- India -RRB- Ltd. -LRB- 30 January 1990 , CA Tr . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	717	No. 60 of 1990 -RRB- per Sir David Croom-Johnson , Nash v. Eli Lilly at pp.797-8 , per Purchas LJ and Dobbie v. Medway Health Authority at p. 1240 , per Sir Thomas Bingham MR. Consistently with the clear wording of the statutory language , the authorities also emphasise that s. 14A is concerned with knowledge in this sense of the attributability of the damage suffered to the act or omission allegedly constituting negligence : see e.g. Halford v. Brookes -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 428 , 443D per Lord Donaldson MR , Dobbie v. Medway Health Authority -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 WLR 1234 , 1240E-H per Sir Thomas Bingham MR and Spargo v. North Essex District Health Authority -LSB- 1997 -RSB- PIQR P235 , P242 , per Brooke LJ in the passages quoted in paragraph 112 above . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	718	This is , of course , of particular relevance in cases where there is another possible cause -LRB- cf Irshad Ali v. Courtaulds Textiles Ltd. -LSB- 1999 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep. Medical 301 -RRB- , though it must always be remembered that all that s. 14A requires is knowledge that loss is `` capable '' of being attributed in whole or `` in part '' to the act or omission alleged to constitute a particular defendant 's negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	719	It has indeed been held that a claimant may have the requisite knowledge although he faces alternative possible defendants , one or other but not both of whom may be liable -LRB- cf Halford v. Brookes -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 428 , 443G-H -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	720	123 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	721	The singularity of the present case is , as I have indicated , that it concerns only actual knowledge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	722	The authorities show the importance of the constructive knowledge which may arise under s. 14 -LRB- 3 -RRB- and s. 14A -LRB- 10 -RRB- : see e.g. Nash v. Eli Lilly at pp.796F-G and 799E-801A , Broadley v. Guy Clapham & Co. at pp. 333 per Leggatt LJ and 333-4 per Hoffmann LJ and Hallam-Eames at pp.180-2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	723	In Broadley the claimant went into hospital for the removal of a foreign or loose body in her knee , but came out with what she was , within a relatively short period , told was permanent foot drop . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	724	Leggatt LJ said at p. 333 that knowledge of the mechanics of damage to a nerve was not required , and that she had `` constructively '' within just over a year of the operation `` such specific knowledge of an act or omission which might amount to negligence as would have enabled her to investigate it timeously '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	725	Hoffmann LJ said at pp.333-4 that : He considered that the relevant knowledge was either possessed by Mrs Broadley , or could have been ascertained by her from any doctor whom she chose to consult , `` within a few months of the operation '' , and that was `` quite enough to make it reasonable for her to commence an investigation into whether or not the acts in question gave rise to a cause of action '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	726	A similar explanation of Broadley was given in Hallam-Eames where Hoffmann LJ said at p. 180 that 124 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	727	In Hallam-Eames , the Court also responded to a submission that `` requiring knowledge of whether potential liabilities were capable of reasonable quantification was to introduce dangerously imprecise criteria '' by pointing out -LRB- at p. 182 -RRB- that Whether the Names knew sufficient to put them over this threshold was , Hoffmann LJ pointed out , a question of degree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	728	On the facts , the Court concluded that the issue `` of what the plaintiffs knew or could reasonably have ascertained '' could not be decided on a summary basis , because , although the accounts showed that `` over successive years , the RITC premium was on each occasion substantially larger than in the year before '' : 125 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	729	As regards the run off policies , a letter written by the underwriting agents had described them as `` outside the traditional scope of our business '' and as representing `` in hindsight ... poor underwriting judgment '' ; the court in Hallam-Eames said that it was `` well arguable '' that this should have prompted Names to investigate , but was ultimately unwilling on a summary judgment application to hold that `` it amounted to constructive knowledge that the risks reinsured were not reasonably quantifiable '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	730	126 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	731	The language of s. 14A thus recognises a range of different states of mind : -LRB- a -RRB- actual knowledge of the material facts about the damage and other facts relevant to the action -LRB- including therefore knowledge that the loss was capable of being attributed to an act or omission alleged to constitute negligence -RRB- ; -LRB- b -RRB- knowledge that a claimant might reasonably have been expected to acquire -LRB- from facts observable by himself or ascertainable by him or with the help of appropriate expert advice which it would have been reasonable for him to seek -RRB- ; and -LRB- c -RRB- ignorance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	732	Actual knowledge within -LRB- a -RRB- involves knowing enough to make it reasonable to investigate whether or not there is a claim against a particular potential defendant : see paragraph 112 above . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	733	Constructive knowledge within -LRB- b -RRB- involves a situation where , although the claimant does not yet know sufficient for -LRB- a -RRB- to apply , he knows sufficient to make it reasonable for him -LRB- by himself or with advice -RRB- to acquire further knowledge which would satisfy -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	734	127 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	735	Because the present case is concerned only with actual knowledge , the claimants have to do no more than negative actual knowledge on Mr Haward 's part that the damage suffered was capable of being attributed to the act or omission now alleged to constitute negligence on Fawcetts ' part . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	736	I therefore turn to the facts to consider the difference in analysis and result between the judge and the Court of Appeal on this essentially factual point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	737	The facts and the evidence 128 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	738	I have in paragraph 96 above summarised in very broad outline the history of the years 1995 to 1998 , during which the claimants made the initial and subsequent unexpectedly large investments and it eventually became apparent that they had become lost . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	739	The question is when Mr Haward actually knew both enough of the acts or omissions now alleged to constitute negligence and that the loss suffered was capable of being attributable thereto to make it reasonable for him to begin to investigate whether or not the claimants had a claim against Fawcetts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	740	That would be the case , taking the reasoning in Hallam-Eames , once he realised that he had prima facie cause to complain of unsoundness from the outset of the investments ; this would in turn suggest unsoundness in the advice given or not given by Fawcetts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	741	In relation to the issue raised by this question , the onus was on the claimants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	742	It was for the claimants to displace the basic limitation period by showing , if they could , that Mr Haward did not have the requisite knowledge prior to 6th December 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	743	129 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	744	Mr Haward 's witness statement and evidence were however focused on a different matter , which was when he was first made aware that he might have `` a claim for damages in negligence '' against Fawcetts and when he `` might first have been in a position to commence proceedings in respect of such a claim '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	745	Mr Haward 's statement merely recited the losses sustained by HAL from A1995 to 1997 , before moving to detailed discussion of events from February 1998 when - `` faced with ever mounting losses '' , as he put it - he instructed a business adviser , Mr Peter Hughes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	746	It was , he said , not until Mr Peter Hughes suggested it in May 1999 that he became aware of the possibility of pursuing a claim against Fawcetts ; some time thereafter investigations into Fawcetts ' advice were begun , leading eventually to a positive opinion from counsel in February 2001 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	747	In response , it was suggested on Fawcetts ' behalf in cross-examination and submissions that serious thoughts were being given to pursuing a claim in negligence against Fawcetts at earlier dates pre-dating 6th December 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	748	It was to this issue , as I see it , that the findings made by HHJ Playford at the end of his judgment `` for the sake of completeness only '' were directed , Like HHJ Playford , but for the different reasons I have already explained , I think that these findings were not directed to the right test . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	749	However , so far as they may be material , I see the force of , and would for my part accept , the criticisms directed by Mr Pooles QC on behalf of Mr Haward at the judge 's finding that the claimants had not even established that it was only after 6th December 1998 that Mr Haward actually thought of pursuing a claim in negligence against Fawcetts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	750	I can in the circumstances state my reasons briefly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	751	130 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	752	First , the judge himself said , as part of his recital of the background , that `` It was not until May 1999 that Mr Hughes first suggested to Mr Haward that a claim might lie against Fawcetts for negligence ... '' and , later , that `` That investigation -LSB- viz `` to isolate the causal link between the acts and omissions alleged against Fawcetts and the losses '' -RSB- did not even commence until May 1999 - apparently as a consequence of Mr Hughes ' involvement ... '' These statements are , as the Court of Appeal thought , in apparent tension with the judge 's later conclusion that the claimants had not established that they first knew that they had any claim against Fawcetts after 6th December 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	753	131 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	754	Secondly , bearing in mind evidence about Mr Hughes 's litigiousness , impetuosity and disinclination to hold back , it is hard to think that , if Mr Hughes had formed adverse views about Fawcetts ' conduct of the affairs of Mr Haward and the other claimants in relation to HAL at an earlier date , Mr Hughes would not given these clear expression in documents , investigation and a claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	755	The judge placed weight on the fact that Mr Hughes would have told Mr Haward at once of any such views . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	756	Not only did Mr Haward deny that he was ever told of any such views , but , if he had been , one would have expected him to have told Mr Taylor , a solicitor with whom he shared an office who had also been introduced to and was acting for Mr Haward . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	757	Yet Mr Taylor gave detailed evidence about how the idea of a claim in negligence against Fawcetts in respect of HAL first occurred to him in the context of discovery in the claim involving Mr Brunt in May 1999 , and how - far from Mr Hughes mentioning it to him - he mentioned it to Mr Hughes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	758	132 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	759	Thirdly , Mr Hughes prepared some instructions to counsel in February 2001 , which purported to record a meeting in March 1998 at which Mr Austreng admitted not carrying out a full and proper audit of HAL 's `` stock or its overall financial position '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	760	But this account was not supported by the oral evidence given by Mr Haward and was contradicted by that given by Mr Taylor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	761	It seems implausible that a professional man in Mr Austreng 's position would react as he is reported to have done , or would admit , at least without saying something by way of excuse or explanation , `` that he had at no time carried out a full and proper audit of either the company 's stock or its overall financial position '' .

152	762	The absence of any follow up by way of investigation , if any such statement was made , would also be striking . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	763	Mr Haward and Mr Taylor gave evidence that Mr Hughes ' advice leading Mr Haward to move from Fawcetts to another accountant , Mr Patel , in Spring 1998 was not based on any concern about Fawcetts ' conduct in relation to HAL , but rather -LRB- Mr Taylor said -RRB- because Mr Patel was a tax specialist .

152	764	133 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	765	Fourthly , the judge 's treatment of a draft letter dated 8th December 1998 , also prepared by Mr Hughes , failed to take account of the unchallenged evidence regarding both its background -LRB- consisting in the discussions and fears about the potential tax penalties relating to the Form IHT 200 -RRB- and the absence of any relevant follow up to it , save in relation to tax penalties and Mr Austreng 's position as trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
152	766	Mr Hughes ' impetuousness is evident in the language of the draft , in the inability of Mr Haward 's then solicitor , Mr Quinney , to see any basis on which to send such a letter and in the fact that none was sent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	767	134 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	768	Accordingly , if the issue had been when Mr Haward first considered the possibility of pursuing a claim in negligence against Fawcetts , I would not disagree with the Court of Appeal 's decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	769	But that is not the critical issue , which is identified in paragraph 128 above . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	770	The critical issue 135 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	771	Mr Haward was described in an unchallenged part of Mr Taylor 's witness statement as `` not very sophisticated in complex financial matters , and ... very trusting of his professional advisers '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	772	Even so , there was a very remarkable discrepancy between the very limited cash injections contemplated as necessary by the 1995 business plan and the actual investments required in 1995 and succeeding years , and concomitantly between the expected profit and loss position and the actual outturn in such years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	773	Mr Haward in his statement did not address his state of mind in the years 1995 to early 1998 regarding the causes of HAL 's losses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	774	In cross-examination he was unable to give a coherent account of his thinking or of any discussion which he might have had with Mr Austreng in these years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	775	He said that he could not remember whether he had asked Mr Austreng about the unanticipated position which emerged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	776	He recalled only saying to Mr Austreng at one stage , in the light of the continuing losses , `` I ca n't keep going on like this '' , as well as being `` very surprised '' at a board meeting at Mr Austreng 's optimism ; so , Mr Haward added , they `` went on a bit more , but it was only a matter of time before you ... . ran out of money '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	777	Mr Haward did briefly mention , as causes which `` all contributed to making losses '' , the recession , the consideration that `` farmers are bad payers '' and the problem with Mr Brunt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	778	But he did not say that he , at any point , believed that all or any of these factors accounted for the whole or even the greater part of HAL 's unanticipated losses and the extra injections of cash thereby necessitated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	779	In re-examination he described the situation in 1997 in these terms : '' ... basically , Mrs Vauxhall would say , ` John , I want some money , you know , to pay the bills ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	780	And ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	781	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	782	either you paid the cheque or you just got the company closed down , and you thought all that money you 've put in you 've lost . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	783	You thought you might , there might be a chance of trading out of it so you , you paid them the money . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	784	136 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	785	Mr Palmer QC for Fawcetts submits that Mr Haward must have realised that the investment losses he sustained by 6th December 1998 were capable of being attributed to some unsoundness in the venture , particularly in the business plan on which Fawcetts advised , or in Fawcetts ' advice , giving prima facie cause for complaint , or at least that Mr Haward 's evidence failed to establish the contrary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	786	Friendship or loyalty , or indeed ignorance of the law of negligence , would not , as such , matter if this was Mr Haward 's state of mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	787	There is in the answer quoted at the end of the preceding paragraph a possible indication that , despite the obvious discrepancy between the expected position allegedly confirmed by Fawcetts ' advice and the loss-making outcome , Mr Haward was prepared to hope for the best , and why he might thus have been prepared to overlook , or at least not to pursue for the time being , obvious question-marks over the advice allegedly received from Fawcetts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	788	Fawcetts were after all long-standing family accountants and financial advisers and he was on friendly terms with Mr Austreng . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	789	137 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	790	In response to such points , Jonathan Parker LJ drew attention to the other problems which affected HAL 's business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	791	However there are difficulties about this response . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	792	First , I have already drawn attention to Mr Haward 's very limited evidence about such other problems and their impact on HAL and on his thinking . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	793	Secondly , Jonathan Parker LJ referred to `` a number of possible causes for the failure of the Company '' , but possible additional causes of damage would not be relevant , if one contributing cause was , to the claimants ' knowledge , also the defendants ' act or omission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	794	Thirdly , and more fundamentally , the present claim is not for damage resulting from failure of HAL . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	795	Rather , it proceeds on the basis that , whatever happened to HAL , the claimants were induced by Fawcetts ' negligence to invest monies which they would not otherwise have invested and which were before 6th December 1998 known to be lost ; and that this process started with the initial acquisition in December 1994 and continued thereafter from year to year , on the basis of Fawcetts ' original advice and -LRB- as Mr Haward put it in his evidence -RRB- their failure to advise to the contrary thereafter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	796	Fourthly , while `` the best-laid schemes o'mice an ' men gang aft agley '' , it is hard to see that the undoubtedly difficult trading conditions which HAL experienced during the relevant period could have been regarded as explaining the hugely and on its face disastrously different position - when compared with that projected by the 1995 business plan - which emerged as soon as Mr Haward had taken over HAL and continued thereafter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	797	One would have thought that there was , on its face , something unsound with the whole venture , and almost inevitably therefore , on the claimants ' case , something unsound about any advice given with regard to its viability and advisability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	798	On this basis , Mr Palmer submits that the present case is comparable to Dobbie , where , once Mrs Dobbie knew that a healthy breast had been removed , then , as Hoffmann LJ said in Hallam-Eames , she knew sufficiently that the operation was an act of which she would seem prima facie entitled to complain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	799	Conclusion 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	800	138	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	801	I have not found this an easy appeal to resolve on the facts , bearing in mind that all that is in issue is actual knowledge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	802	The difficulty I have found would have been unlikely to exist had the issue of constructive knowledge been squarely raised before the judge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	803	The House was not invited to depart from the Court of Appeal ' s conclusion that it was not open to Fawcetts to assert constructive knowledge within s . 14A 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	804	Ultimately however, bearing in mind the limitations and weakness of Mr Haward ' s evidence, the obviousness of the company ' s problems from the outset in contrast with the optimism of the 1995 business plan and of Fawcetts ' alleged advice and attitude , I would decide the appeal on the simple basis that the claimants failed to discharge , or even satisfactorily to address , the onus on them of proving that Mr Haward did not have the requisite knowledge identified in paragraph 128 above . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
152	805	On that basis I agree that the appeal succeeds .	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
