108	1	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
108	2	LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
108	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
108	4	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
108	5	After the conclusion of the hearing , and following deliberation , the parties were informed that the appeal would be allowed for reasons to be given later . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
108	6	The following are my reasons for inviting the House to allow the appeal , to set aside the orders below and to quash the Secretary of State 's decision that the appellant and her son must be returned to Lebanon . 	lord hope	self	outcome	0	lord bingham
108	7	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
108	8	The case for allowing the appellant and her son to remain in this country on humanitarian grounds is compelling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
108	9	That is shown by the facts that my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill has described . 	lord hope	lord bingham	partagr	0	lord bingham
108	10	But the appellant does not wish to rely on the Secretary of State 's discretion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
108	11	She claims that she has a right to remain here under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights read in conjunction with article 14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
108	12	So the question is whether she has established that she and her son would run a real risk of a flagrant denial of the right to respect for their family life guaranteed to her by those articles if they were to be removed from this country to Lebanon . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
108	13	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
108	14	I take the wording of the test to be applied to determine whether there would be a flagrant denial of this right from what Judges Bratza , Bonello and Hedigan said in their joint partly dissenting opinion in Mamatkulov and Askarov v Turkey -LRB- 2005 -RRB- 41 EHRR 494 , 537-539 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
108	15	That was a case where political dissidents claimed that they would not receive a fair trial if they were extradited to Uzbekistan because , among other things , torture was routinely used to secure guilty verdicts and because suspects were frequently denied access to a lawyer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
108	16	Their case was that they ran a real risk of a flagrant denial of justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
108	17	In para O-III14 the judges said : `` In our view , what the word ` flagrant ' is intended to convey is a breach of the principles of fair trial guaranteed by article 6 which is so fundamental as to amount to a nullification , or destruction of the very essence , of the right guaranteed by that article . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
108	18	In paras O-III17 and O-III19 they used the expression `` a real risk '' to describe the standard which the evidence has to achieve in order to show that the expulsion or extradition of the individual would , if carried out , violate the article . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
108	19	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
108	20	I have gone directly to what those judges said about the test in Mamatkulov rather than to what was said in R -LRB- Ullah -RRB- v Special Adjudicator , Do v Immigration Appeal Tribunal -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 2 AC 323 and R -LRB- Razgar -RRB- v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 2 AC 368 for several reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
108	21	First , their description of it is the most up to date guidance that is available from Strasbourg . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
108	22	Second , it combines in a simple formula the approach described in Devaseelan v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2003 -RSB- Imm AR 1 , para 111 referred to with approval by Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Carswell in paras 24 and 69 of Ullah with Lord Steyn 's use of the expression `` the very essence of the right '' in para 50 of Ullah . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
108	23	And , third , it shows that Carnwath LJ in the Court of Appeal -LSB- 2007 -RSB- UKHRR 1 , paras 37-38 was , with great respect , wrong to regard words such as `` complete denial '' or `` nullification '' on the one hand and `` flagrant breach '' or `` gross invasion '' on the other as indicating different tests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
108	24	Attempts to explain or analyse the formula should be resisted , in the absence of further guidance from Strasbourg . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
108	25	There is only one test , although I think that how it is to be applied in an article 8 read with article 14 case needs some explanation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	26	The use by the partly dissenting judges of the expression `` a real risk '' is also significant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	27	It shows that what was said about the standard of proof in the context of article 3 in Soering v United Kingdom -LRB- 1989 -RRB- 11 EHRR 439 , para 91 , applies to cases such as this where the rights in issue are among the qualified rights to be found elsewhere in the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	28	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	29	There is however one aspect of this case which I have found particularly difficult . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	30	The appellant came to this country as a fugitive from Shari'a law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	31	Her son had reached the age of seven when , under the system that regulates the custody of a child of that age under Shari'a law in Lebanon , his physical custody would pass by force of law to his father or another male member of his family . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	32	Any attempt by her to retain custody of him there would be bound to fail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	33	This is simply because the law dictates that a mother has no right to the custody of her child after that age . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	34	She may or may not be allowed what has been described as visitation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	35	That would give her access to her son during supervised visits to a place where she could see him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	36	But under no circumstances would his custody remain with her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	37	The close relationship that exists between mother and child up to the age of custodial transfer can not survive under that system of law where , as in this case , the parents of the child are no longer living together when the child reaches that age . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	38	There is a real risk in all these cases that the very essence of the family life that mother and child have shared together up to that date will be destroyed or nullified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	39	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	40	This system was described by counsel during the argument as arbitrary and discriminatory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	41	So it is , if it is to be measured by the human rights standards that we are obliged to apply by the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	42	The mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other 's company is a fundamental element of family life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	43	Under our law non-discrimination is a core principle for the protection of human rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	44	The fact is however that Shari'a law as it is applied in Lebanon was created by and for men in a male dominated society . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	45	The place of the mother in the life of a child under that system is quite different under that law from that which is guaranteed in the Contracting States by article 8 of the Convention read in conjunction with article 14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	46	There is no place in it for equal rights between men and women . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	47	It is , as Lord Bingham points out , the product of a religious and cultural tradition that is respected and observed throughout much of the world . 	lord hope	lord bingham	partagr	0.1	lord bingham
108	48	But by our standards the system is arbitrary because the law permits of no exceptions to its application , however strong the objections may be on the facts of any given case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	49	It is discriminatory too because it denies women custody of their children after they have reached the age of custodial transfer simply because they are women . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	50	That is why the appellant removed her child from that system of law and sought protection against its effects in this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	51	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	52	It seems to me that the Strasbourg court 's jurisprudence indicates that , in the absence of very exceptional circumstances , aliens can not claim any entitlement under the Convention to remain here to escape from the discriminatory effects of the system of family law in their country of origin . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	53	There is a close analogy between this case and N v United Kingdom -LRB- Application No 26565/05 -RRB- -LRB- unreported -RRB- 27 May 2008 which followed the decision of this House in N v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LRB- Terrence Higgins Trust intervening -RRB- -LSB- 2005 -RSB- 2 AC 296 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	54	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	55	In N 's case the appellant was found after her arrival in this country from Uganda to have an AIDS-defining illness for which she was still receiving beneficial medical treatment when the appeal was heard . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	56	She claimed that the treatment that she needed would not be available to her in Uganda and she would die within a matter of months if she were to be returned to that country , whereas she could expect to live for decades if she were to remain in this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	57	That being so , it was argued , the United Kingdom would be in breach of its obligations under article 3 of the Convention if she were to be returned to Uganda . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	58	As Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said in para 1 , the appeal raised a question of profound importance about the obligations of the United Kingdom in respect of the expulsion of people with HIV/AIDS . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	59	The cruel reality was that if the appellant were to be returned to Uganda her ability to obtain the necessary medication was at best problematic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	60	In para 4 Lord Nicholls described her position as similar to having a life-support machine switched off . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	61	Yet the House , with considerable misgivings in what was plainly a very sad case , dismissed her appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	62	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	63	Following that decision the appellant lodged an application against the United Kingdom in Strasbourg . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	64	The Grand Chamber declared her application inadmissible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	65	In para 42 of the decision it said : `` Aliens who are subject to expulsion can not in principle claim any entitlement to remain in the territory of a Contracting State in order to continue to benefit from medical , social or other forms of assistance and services provided by the expelling State . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	66	The fact that the applicant 's circumstances , including his life expectancy , would be significantly reduced if he were to be removed from the Contracting State is not sufficient in itself to give rise to breach of article 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	67	The decision to remove an alien who is suffering from a serious mental or physical illness to a country where the facilities for the treatment of that illness are inferior to those available in the Contracting State may raise an issue under article 3 , but only in a very exceptional case , where the humanitarian grounds against the removal are compelling . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	68	In para 44 the Grand Chamber recalled that , although many of the rights it contains have implications of a social or economic nature , the Convention is essentially directed at the protection of civil and political rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	69	`` Advances in medical science , together with social and economic differences between countries , entail that the level of treatment available in the Contracting State and the country of origin may vary considerably . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	70	While it is necessary , given the fundamental importance of article 3 in the Convention system , for the court to retain a degree of flexibility to prevent expulsion in very exceptional cases , article 3 does not place an obligation on the Contracting State to alleviate such disparities through the provision of free and unlimited health care to all aliens without a right to stay within its jurisdiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	71	A finding to the contrary would place too great a burden on the Contracting States . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	72	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
108	73	That was a case about article 3 , not one of the qualified Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	74	Yet even in such a case , where there was a very real risk that the harm that would result from the applicant 's expulsion to the inferior system of health care in her country of origin would reach the severity of treatment prescribed by that article , the court held that , other than in very exceptional cases , there was no obligation under the Convention to allow her to remain here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	75	This was because it was not the intention of the Convention to provide protection against disparities in social and economic rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	76	To hold otherwise , even in an article 3 case , would place too great a burden on the Contracting States . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	77	Similar observations about the limits that must be set on practical grounds to the qualified obligations that they have undertaken in the area of civil and political rights are to be found in F v United Kingdom -LRB- Application No 17341/03 -RRB- -LRB- unreported -RRB- 22 June 2004 and Z and T v United Kingdom -LRB- Application No 27034/05 -RRB- -LRB- unreported -RRB- 28 February 2006 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	78	These decisions were not available to the House when it was considering the cases of Ullah -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 2 AC 323 and Razgar -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 2 AC 368 , the judgments in which were delivered on 17 June 2004 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	79	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	80	In F v United Kingdom the applicant was an Iranian citizen who had claimed asylum here on the basis that he feared persecution as a homosexual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	81	His application for asylum was rejected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	82	But he claimed that there would be a breach of article 8 if he were to be removed to Iran because a law in that country prohibited adult consensual homosexual activity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	83	His application was declared inadmissible by the Strasbourg court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	84	At p 12 of its decision the court observed that its case law had found responsibility attaching to Contracting States in respect of expelling persons who were at risk of treatment contrary to articles 2 and 3 of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	85	It said that this was based on the fundamental importance of these provisions , whose guarantees it was imperative to render effective in practice : Soering v United Kingdom -LRB- 1989 -RRB- 11 EHRR 439 , para 88 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	86	But it went on to say this : `` Such compelling considerations do not automatically apply under the other provisions of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	87	On a purely pragmatic basis , it can not be required that an expelling Contracting State only return an alien to a country which is in full and effective enforcement of all the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	88	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	89	In Z and T v United Kingdom the applicants were citizens of Pakistan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	90	They were also Christians . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	91	They feared that they would be subjected to attack by Muslim extremists if they were to be returned to Pakistan because they were Christians . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	92	The case raised a question as to the approach to be taken to article 9 rights that were allegedly at risk on expulsion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	93	It was argued that the flagrant denial test should not be applied , as this would fail to respect the primacy of the applicants ' religious rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	94	The Strasbourg court rejected this argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	95	It found that , even assuming that article 9 was capable of being engaged in the case of the expulsion of an individual by a Contracting State , the applicants had not shown that they were personally at risk or were members of such a vulnerable or threatened group , or in such a precarious position as Christians , as might disclose a flagrant violation of article 9 of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	96	But at p 7 of its judgment the court said that it considered that very limited assistance , if any , could be obtained from article 9 by itself : `` Otherwise it would be imposing an obligation on Contracting States effectively to act as indirect guarantors of freedom of worship for the rest of the world . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	97	If , for example , a country outside the umbrella of the Convention were to ban a religion but not impose any measure of persecution , prosecution , deprivation of liberty or ill-treatment , the court doubts that the Convention could be interpreted as requiring a Contracting State to provide the adherents of that banned sect with the possibility of pursuing that religion freely and openly on their own territories . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	98	While the court would not rule out the possibility that the responsibility of the returning state might in exceptional circumstances be engaged under article 9 of the Convention where the person concerned ran a real risk of flagrant violation of that article in the receiving state , the court shares the view of the House of Lords in the Ullah case that it would be difficult to visualise a case in which a sufficiently flagrant violation of article 9 would not also involve treatment in violation of article 3 of the Convention . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	99	The reference in the last sentence endorses Lord Carswell 's observation in para 67 of his opinion in Ullah -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 2 AC 323 that he found it difficult to envisage a case , bearing in mind the flagrancy principle , in which there could be a sufficient interference with the article 9 rights which did not also come within the article 3 exception . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	100	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	101	Running through these three recent cases is a recognition by the Strasbourg court that , while the Contracting States are obliged to protect those from other jurisdictions who can show that for whatever reason they will suffer persecution or are at real risk of death or serious ill-treatment or will face arbitrary detention or a flagrant denial of a fair trial in the receiving country , limits must be set on the extent to which they can be held responsible outside the areas that are prescribed by articles 2 and 3 and by the fundamental right under article 6 to a fair trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	102	Those limits must be seen against the background of the general principle of international law that states have the right to control the entry , residence and expulsion of aliens . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	103	In N v United Kingdom a distinction was drawn between civil and political rights on the one hand and rights of a social or economic nature on the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	104	Despite its fundamental importance in the Convention system , article 3 does not have the effect of requiring a Contracting State to guarantee free and unlimited health care to all aliens who are without a right to stay within its jurisdiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	105	In F v United Kingdom , an article 8 case , a distinction of a different kind was drawn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	106	On the one hand there are those guarantees which , as they are of fundamental importance , must always be rendered effective in practice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	107	On the other there are the qualified rights of a civil or political nature which , on a purely pragmatic basis , the Contracting States can not be required to guarantee for the rest of the world outside the umbrella of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	108	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	109	As this case shows , the principle that men and women have equal rights is not universally recognised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	110	Lebanon is by no means the only state which has declined to subscribe to article 16 -LRB- d -RRB- of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women of 18 December 1979 which declares that States Parties shall ensure , on a basis of equality of men and women , the same rights and responsibilities as parents , irrespective of their marital status , in all matters relating to their children and that in all cases the interests of the children shall be paramount . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	111	For the time being that declaration remains in most , if not all , Islamic states at best an aspiration , not a reality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	112	As the court said in Soering , para 91 , there is no question of adjudicating on or establishing the responsibility of the receiving state , whether under general international law , under the Convention or otherwise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	113	Everything depends on the extent to which responsibility can be placed on the Contracting States . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	114	But they did not undertake to guarantee to men and women throughout the world the enjoyment without discrimination of the rights set out in the Convention or in any other international human rights instrument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	115	Nor did they undertake to alleviate religious and cultural differences between their own laws and the family law of an alien 's country of origin , however extreme their effects might seem to be on a family relationship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	116	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	117	The guidance that is to be found in these decisions indicates that the Strasbourg court would be likely to hold that , except in wholly exceptional circumstances , aliens who are subject to expulsion can not claim an entitlement to remain in the territory of a Contracting State in order to benefit from the equality of treatment as to respect for their family life that they would receive there which would be denied to them in the receiving state . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	118	The return of a woman who arrives here with her child simply to escape from the system of family law of her own country , however objectionable that system may seem in comparison with our own , will not violate article 8 read with article 14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	119	Domestic violence and family breakdown occur in Muslim countries just as they do elsewhere . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	120	So the inevitable result under Shari'a law that the separated mother will lose custody of her child when he reaches the age of custodial transfer ought , in itself , to make no difference . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	121	On a purely pragmatic basis the Contracting States can not be expected to return aliens only to a country whose family law is compatible with the principle of non-discrimination assumed by the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
108	122	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	123	How then can one distinguish between those cases where a violation of articles 8 and 14 that results from applying Shari'a law will be flagrant from those where it will not ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	124	It is hard to envisage a case where the way the law deals with a child custody case will also violate article 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	125	The possibility of a violation of that article may have a part to play in the assessment in more extreme article 9 religious persecution cases , as Lord Carswell 's observation in Ullah , para 67 and its adoption by the Strasbourg court in Z and T , p 7 , indicate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	126	That may be the case in some article 8 cases , as in F . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	127	But it is likely to be absent in article 8 plus article 14 cases where the complaint is about the effects of discriminatory family law on the relationship that exists between individuals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	128	It has not been suggested in this case that there is a risk that the application of the Shari'a law would result in persecution of the appellant approaching the level prescribed by article 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	129	So that check as to whether a flagrant breach has been established can not be relied on in the assessment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	130	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	131	There remains the observation that the Grand Chamber made in N v United Kingdom , 27 May 2008 , para 42 , that an issue under article 3 may be raised only in a very exceptional medical treatment case where the humanitarian grounds against the removal are compelling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	132	D v United Kingdom -LRB- 1997 -RRB- 24 EHRR 423 , where the applicant was critically ill and close to death , was such a case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	133	This suggests that the key to identifying those cases where the breach of articles 8 and 14 will be flagrant lies in an assessment of the effects on both mother and child of destroying or nullifying the family life that they have shared together . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	134	The cases where that assessment shows that the violation will be flagrant will be very exceptional . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	135	But where the humanitarian grounds against their removal are compelling , it must follow that there is an obligation not to remove . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	136	The risk of adding one test to another is obvious . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	137	But in the absence of further guidance from Strasbourg as to how the flagrancy test is to be applied in article 8 cases , I would adopt that approach in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	138	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	139	As I said as the outset of this opinion , the case for allowing the appellant and her son to remain in this country on humanitarian grounds is compelling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	140	This is particularly so when the effects on the child are take into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	141	His mother has cared from him since his birth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	142	He has a settled and happy relationship with her in this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	143	Life with his mother is the only family life he knows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	144	Life with his father or any other member of his family in Lebanon , with whom he has never had any contact , would be totally alien to him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	145	This enables me to conclude that this is a very exceptional case and that there is a real risk of a flagrant denial of their article 8 rights if the appellant and her child were to be returned to Lebanon . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	146	I would allow the appeal . 	lord hope	self	outcome	0.3	lord bingham
108	147	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	148	LORD BINGHAM OF CORNHILL 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	149	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	150	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	151	By article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights , given domestic effect by the Human Rights Act 1998 , everyone in this country has the right to respect for their family life , which may be the subject of interference by a public authority only if the interference is lawful , proportionate and directed to a legitimate end . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	152	The enjoyment of this right is , by article 14 , to be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	153	The appellant claims that if she and her son AF are removed from this country to Lebanon on the direction of the respondent Secretary of State , her right to respect for her family life will be infringed and will be so on a discriminatory basis attributable to her being a woman . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	154	This claim rests not on any treatment she or AF will suffer in this country but on the consequences if she and her son are returned to Lebanon . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	155	Thus this is what has been described as a foreign case : the only conduct by a British authority of which the appellant complains is her removal to a place where she will suffer these consequences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	156	Her challenge is directed to the decision to remove her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	157	The burden lying on a claimant in a foreign case such as this is , the appellant acknowledges , a very exacting one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	158	But she contends that , on the exceptional facts of her case , and recognising the interests of AF , she discharges it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	159	The courts below held that she did not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	160	The appellant submits that those courts did not correctly understand and apply the test laid down by the authorities , and that the interests of AF -LRB- who was first given leave to intervene in the House -RRB- should be taken into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	161	Her submissions are supported by AF , and also by JUSTICE and Liberty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	162	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	163	The appellant EM is a Lebanese national now aged 36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	164	She came to this country on 30 December 2004 with her son AF , the second intervener , who was born on 16 July 1996 and is now aged 12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	165	She claimed asylum . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	166	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	167	The appellant is Muslim and married in Lebanon according to Muslim rites . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	168	Her evidence , accepted as true in these proceedings , is that during her marriage her husband subjected her to violence , beating her , trying to throw her off a balcony and trying , on one occasion at least , to strangle her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	169	She had a mental breakdown . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
108	170	Her husband was imprisoned for theft from her father 's shop and , later , for failing to support AF . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	171	He ended her first pregnancy by hitting her on the stomach with a heavy vase , saying he did not want children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	172	On the day AF was born he came to the hospital with his family to take the child away to Saudi Arabia , but was prevented from doing so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	173	He has not seen AF since . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	174	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	175	The appellant divorced her husband in Lebanon because of his violence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	176	Under the prevailing law the father retained legal custody of AF , but the divorce court ruled that the child should remain in the appellant 's care until he reached the age of seven . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	177	Thereafter , Islamic law as applied in Lebanon entitled the father to require that physical custody should be transferred to himself or to a male member of his family . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	178	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	179	After the divorce the appellant supported herself and AF by running a hairdressing salon . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	180	When AF was approaching the age of seven she began trying to leave the country to avoid having the child taken from her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	181	After AF 's birthday , she moved out of her parents ' house and lived in hiding to prevent his removal from her care . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	182	Her former husband issued proceedings in the Lebanese court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	183	The police attended at her parents ' house and her former husband harassed them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	184	The appellant and her child left Lebanon with the assistance of an agent , leaving the country on 20 December 2004 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	185	It appears that , if she returned to Lebanon , she would be at risk of imprisonment on a charge of kidnapping AF . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	186	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	187	There was unchallenged evidence before the lower courts of Islamic law as applied in Lebanon in custody cases where -LRB- as in this case -RRB- the husband or both parties are Muslim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	188	Even during the seven year period when a child is cared for by the mother , the father retains legal custody and may decide where the child lives and whether the child may travel with the mother . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	189	In the absence of consent by the father , the transfer to the father at the stipulated age is automatic : the court has no discretion in the matter and may not consider whether transfer is in the best interests of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	190	As a result , women are often constrained to remain in abusive marriages for fear of losing their children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	191	If the father were found to be unfit as a parent , the child would be passed to the paternal grandfather or some other member of the father 's extended family , not to the mother . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	192	The evidence was that in this situation the mother might , or might not , have contact with the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	193	The parent with physical custody can not be compelled to send the child to the other parent 's home on visits , but if ordered by the court must bring the child to a place where the mother could see him or her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	194	A custody hearing , if held in Lebanon , would not consider whether custody should remain with the mother but only the appropriateness of allowing the appellant to have access to AF during supervised visits . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	195	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	196	The appellant 's application for asylum was refused by the Secretary of State in a letter of 21 February 2005 , largely devoted to issues arising under the Refugee Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	197	But the Secretary of State considered , and rejected , her claim under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights , ruling that she had not demonstrated a real risk of mistreatment such as to engage article 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	198	It was not accepted that she would be unable to obtain a reasonable , fair and impartial administration of her case in both the religious and civil courts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	199	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	200	The appellant exercised her right of appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	201	In a decision dated 8 June 2005 the Immigration Judge -LRB- Mr C J Deavin -RRB- found that the appellant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a -LRB- Refugee -RRB- Convention reason , and so rejected her asylum claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	202	He also held -LRB- para 94 -RRB- that she could not choose where she wished to lead her life , and that her removal would not engage article 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	203	In para 95 of his Decision he said : `` It is likely , of course , that her child will be taken away from her , in accordance with the law of the land , but there is every likelihood that she will be allowed visitation rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	204	It is unrealistic on her part to expect to have the child entirely to herself . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	205	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	206	On an application for reconsideration of this decision , a Senior Immigration Judge -LRB- Mr Andrew Jordan -RRB- thought it arguable that inadequate consideration had been given to whether removal would violate the appellant 's human rights and -LRB- perhaps -RRB- those of AF , if those were justiciable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	207	He was also troubled at the prospect that the case had to be considered on the basis of the appellant 's rights , paying scant regard to those of AF and , in particular , his best interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	208	He acknowledged the difficulty of ruling on the best interests of AF in the absence of the father . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	209	He was also concerned about certain aspects of the asylum claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	210	He ordered reconsideration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	211	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	212	The matter then came before the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal -LRB- Mr C M G Ockelton , Deputy President , Mr N W Renton , Senior Immigration Judge , and Mr D R Humphrey , Immigration Judge -RRB- which gave its Determination and Reasons on 22 November 2005 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	213	The AIT first considered , and rejected , the appellant 's asylum claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	214	With reference to her claim under article 8 , the AIT referred to recent decisions of the House in R -LRB- Ullah -RRB- v Special Adjudicator -LSB- 2004 -RSB- UKHL 26 , -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 2 AC 323 and R -LRB- Razgar -RRB- v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2004 -RSB- UKHL 27 , -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 2 AC 368 , which -LRB- para 15 -RRB- established that `` The appellant can only succeed if she can show that the country to which she returns has a flagrant disregard for the rights protected by article 8 '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	215	The tribunal continued -LRB- para 16 -RRB- : `` On the material before us , that is clearly not so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	216	There is a judicial system , to which the appellant has access . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	217	The system of family law to which she , by her religion , is subject , is one which in this respect she does not like : but that does not permit her to choose the law of another country , nor does it permit us to say that it is a system to which nobody should be subject . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	218	As a result , we can not say that the removal of the appellant and her son to Lebanon would itself constitute a breach of the rights they have under article 8 while they remain in the jurisdiction of this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
108	219	After their removal , they simply have no such rights : they are subject to the law of their own country , which is not a party to the European Convention on Human Rights . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	220	The tribunal refused leave to appeal against its decision but Buxton LJ granted it on one ground , later enlarged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	221	The appellant 's claim to asylum lapsed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	222	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	223	The appellant 's appeal to the Court of Appeal came before Carnwath and Gage LJJ and Bodey J , each of whom gave judgments : -LSB- 2007 -RSB- UKHRR 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	224	In his leading judgment , Carnwath LJ made detailed reference to four authorities in particular : Ullah and Razgar , mentioned above , In re J -LRB- A Child -RRB- -LRB- Custody Rights : Jurisdiction -RRB- -LSB- 2005 -RSB- UKHL 40 , -LSB- 2006 -RSB- 1 AC 80 , and Marckx v Belgium -LRB- 1979 -RRB- 2 EHRR 330 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	225	The critical divide between the parties was as to the appropriate test in a foreign case under article 8 and its application to the facts of the appellant 's case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	226	For the appellant Ms Webber contended that her right to have her claim to custody reviewed on a non-discriminatory basis would be completely denied or nullified if she and AF were returned to Lebanon . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	227	Ms Greaney , for the Secretary of State , criticised this as too narrow a formulation of the appellant 's right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	228	Article 8 protected the right to family life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	229	Although the appellant would lose custody of her son , this did not establish that she would lose all contact with him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	230	Thus her enjoyment of family life with her child , though severely restricted , would not be completely denied or nullified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	231	Carnwath LJ said -LRB- paras 36-40 -RRB- : `` 36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	232	With considerable misgivings , I am forced to the conclusion that Miss Greaney is correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	233	My misgivings are due principally to the natural reluctance of an English judge to send a child back to a legal system where a crucial custody issue will be decided without necessary reference to his welfare . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	234	That would be an overriding consideration in other jurisdictions , but it is not suggested that it can be determinative in the context of asylum law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	235	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	236	In addition I have not found it easy to give effect to the different expressions which have been used to define the test . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	237	If ` complete denial ' or ` nullification ' is the test , I agree with Miss Greaney 's analysis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	238	The right in question is the right protected by article 8 , of which custody is but one important aspect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	239	On the evidence her article 8 right would not be completely denied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	240	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	241	However , one finds many other formulations in the passages of high authority cited above : ` flagrant denial ' , ` gross violation ' , ` flagrant violation of the very essence of the right ' , ` flagrant , gross or fundamental breach ' , ` gross invasion of -LSB- her -RSB- most fundamental human rights ' , ` particularly flagrant breaches ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	242	To my mind there is a difference in ordinary language between ` complete denial ' of the rights guaranteed by article 8 , and ` flagrant breach ' or ` gross invasion ' of those rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	243	In short , the former is quantitative ; the latter qualitative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	244	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	245	If one or more of the latter expressions provided the test , I would find it difficult to think they are not satisfied in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	246	This is not a case where the answer could realistically be affected by representations from the receiving state -LRB- a factor mentioned by Lord Bingham of Cornhill in Ullah , para 24 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	247	The parent/child relationship is a fundamental aspect of the rights guaranteed by article 8 , perhaps the most fundamental ; in Lord Steyn 's words , it goes to ` the very essence ' of the right to family life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	248	The ability to participate in that relationship on an equal basis to the father is similarly fundamental to the rights guaranteed by article 14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	249	Those rights are also recognised as fundamental by the wider international community . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	250	The facts disclose the almost certain prospect of an open ` breach ' or ` violation ' of those rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	251	A breach which is open , unmitigated , and in Convention terms indefensible can fairly be described as ` flagrant ' in the ordinary use of that word . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	252	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	253	However , I am persuaded that that is not the right approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	254	The word ` flagrant ' was first used in Soering v United Kingdom -LRB- 1989 -RRB- 11 EHRR 439 not , I think , as a definitive test , but to illustrate the extreme circumstances which would be needed to bring the Convention into play in a ` foreign ' case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	255	As Lord Bingham of Cornhill pointed out in Ullah , the Strasbourg case-law reveals no examples of cases which have been held to meet that test . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	256	The different expressions used in the domestic cases have been used for a similar purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	257	Linguistic analysis and comparison is unlikely to be helpful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	258	Lord Bingham of Cornhill 's adoption of the Devaseelan formula , with the agreement of the whole House , was clearly intended to provide a single authoritative approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	259	Applying that test , I conclude that the appeal on this central issue must fail . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	260	The appellant 's appeal under article 14 of the European Convention was also rejected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	261	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	262	Gage LJ reached the same conclusion , also with misgiving . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	263	He noted -LRB- para 54 -RRB- that the well-established principle of domestic law which requires the welfare of the child to be treated as paramount was agreed to be irrelevant , and continued : `` 55 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	264	For my part I have not found this an easy case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	265	On the one hand to deny a mother the right to care for her child seems totally wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	266	Judge Martens in a different context described the right to care for ` your own children ' as ` a fundamental element of an elementary right ' -LRB- see Gül v Switzerland -LRB- 1996 -RRB- 22 EHRR 93 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
108	267	To deny this right offends against all principles of fairness to a party involved in litigation over the custody of her child or children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	268	It will undoubtedly place a substantial obstacle in the way of this appellant maintaining and fostering her relationship with her son . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	269	It is an entirely arbitrary rule without any apparent justification . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	270	56 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	271	On the other hand I see the force of the submission made on behalf of the respondent that not all the appellant 's rights as a mother will be denied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	272	She will have rights of visitation and will not lose contact with her son . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	273	In that sense her rights can not be said to be completely nullified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	274	57 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	275	In my judgment this is a case , as envisaged by Lord Carswell in Ullah , where the concept of flagrant breach or violation is not easy to apply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	276	Not without some hesitation , I have concluded that the risk of such breaches of her human rights as may occur in respect of the appellant 's right to care for her son are not sufficient to be categorised as flagrant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	277	In reaching this conclusion , in my view , the appellant 's rights of visitation/contact must be taken into account and set against the denial of the right to custody/residence of her child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	278	It is important to note that we are considering her rights and not those of her son . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	279	There is no reason to suppose that the Shari'a Court will prevent the appellant from seeing her son . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	280	The form and nature of visitation rights remain undefined but in my judgment it must be supposed that the appellant will continue to be permitted to see her son . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	281	In that way her ability to maintain her relationship with him will still exist , albeit on a less intense level than before . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	282	In the circumstances I would hold , as the AIT held , that the risk of breaches of her article 8 and 14 rights in all the circumstances are not such as can be said to be flagrant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	283	For the avoidance of doubt I would also hold that the discrimination against her on grounds of gender in the Shari'a Court whether considered as a breach of her article 8 rights or separately as a breach of article 14 rights , is not sufficient to tip the balance so as to cross the high threshold required . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	284	58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	285	For these reasons and the reasons given by Carnwath LJ , with which I agree , I would dismiss this appeal , and dispose of the applications as he proposes . 	lord bingham	self	outcome	0.6	lord bingham

108	288	Acknowledging the right to care for one 's child as `` a fundamental element of an elementary human right '' -LRB- as quoted by Baroness Hale of Richmond , in Razgar -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 2 AC 368 , para 53 -RRB- , Bodey J regarded the anticipated interference with the appellant 's right to respect for her family life to be flagrant , both by virtue of article 8 read alone and especially when read with article 14 -LRB- paras 66 , 76 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	289	But applying what he understood to be the correct test , he concluded with express misgivings that the appellant could not cross the threshold to obtain relief -LRB- paras 66 , 71 , 76 , 80-82 -RRB- . Ullah 32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham

108	291	Thus , as in the present case , the appellants ' claims rested not on the conduct of the British authorities -LRB- save in removing her -RRB- but on the expected consequences in the foreign country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	292	Theirs were foreign cases in the same sense as the appellant 's . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	293	The question in the appeal was whether removal could be resisted in reliance on any article of the Convention other than article 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	294	That removal could be resisted in a foreign case engaging article 3 was clearly established by well-known authority , notably Soering v United Kingdom -LRB- 1989 -RRB- 11 EHRR 439 and Chahal v United Kingdom -LRB- 1996 -RRB- 23 EHRR 413 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	295	But could other articles of the Convention be relied on ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	296	The Court of Appeal -LSB- 2002 -RSB- EWCA Civ 1856 , -LSB- 2003 -RSB- 1 WLR 770 , para 64 , had held that where the Convention was invoked on the sole ground of the treatment to which an alien , refused the right to enter this country or remain here , was likely to be subjected by the receiving state , and that treatment was not sufficiently severe to engage article 3 , the English court was not required to recognise that any other article of the Convention was or might be engaged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	297	The decision of the Secretary of State in such cases was not subject to the constraints of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	298	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	299	Although separate opinions were delivered , the members of the House were at one in giving two answers to the question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	300	First , they held that articles other than article 3 , including article 8 , could in principle be engaged in relation to the removal of an individual from this country : paras 21 , 35 , 39 - 49 , 52 , 53 , 62 , 67 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	301	Secondly , they held that the threshold of success in such a case was a very high one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	302	In para 24 of my opinion , to which much argument was addressed in the present case , in the courts below and in argument before the House , I expressed myself as follows : `` 24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	303	While the Strasbourg jurisprudence does not preclude reliance on articles other than article 3 as a ground for existing extradition or expulsion , it makes it quite clear that successful reliance demands presentation of a very strong case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	304	In relation to article 3 , it is necessary to show strong grounds for believing that the person , if returned , faces a real risk of being subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment : Soering , para 91 ; Cruz Varas , para 69 ; Vlvarajah , para 103 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	305	In Dehwari , para 61 -LRB- see para 15 above -RRB- the Commission doubted whether a real risk was enough to resist removal under article 2 , suggesting that the loss of life must be shown to be a ` near certainty ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	306	Where reliance is placed on article 6 it must be shown that a person has suffered or risks suffering a flagrant denial of a fair trial in the receiving state : Soering , para 113 -LRB- see para 10 above -RRB- ; Drodz , para 110 ; Einhorn , para 32 ; Razaghi v Sweden ; Tomic v United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	307	Successful reliance on article 5 would have to meet no less exacting a test . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	308	The lack of success of applicants relying on articles 2 , 5 and 6 before the Strasbourg court highlights the difficulty of meeting the stringent test which that court imposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	309	This difficulty will not be less where reliance is placed on articles such as 8 or 9 , which provide for the striking of a balance between the right of the individual and the wider interests of the community even in a case where a serious interference is shown . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	310	This is not a balance which the Strasbourg court ought ordinarily to strike in the first instance , nor is it a balance which that court is well placed to assess in the absence of representations by the receiving state whose laws , institutions or practices are the subject of criticism . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	311	On the other hand , the removing state will always have what will usually be strong grounds for justifying its own conduct : the great importance of operating firm and orderly immigration control in an expulsion case ; the great desirability of honouring extradition treaties made with other states . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	312	The correct approach in cases involving qualified rights such as those under articles 8 and 9 is in my opinion that indicated by the Immigration Appeal Tribunal -LRB- Mr C M G Ockelton , deputy president , Mr Allen and Mr Moulden -RRB- in Devaseelan v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2003 -RSB- Imm A R 1 , para 111 : ` The reason why flagrant denial or gross violation is to be taken into account is that it is only in such a case - where the right will be completely denied or nullified in the destination country - that it can be said that removal will breach the treaty obligations of the signatory state however those obligations might be interpreted or whatever might be said by or on behalf of the destination state . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	313	''' Lord Steyn -LRB- para 50 -RRB- said : `` It will be apparent from the review of Strasbourg jurisprudence that , where other articles may become engaged , a high threshold test will always have to be satisfied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	314	It will be necessary to establish at least a real risk of a flagrant violation of the very essence of the right before other articles could become engaged . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	315	Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe agreed with my opinion -LRB- para 52 -RRB- and Baroness Hale of Richmond with those of myself , Lord Steyn and Lord Carswell , while deferring detailed analysis of article 8 to R -LRB- Razgar -RRB- v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 2 AC 368 , which was heard by the same committee immediately following Ullah . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
108	316	Lord Carswell , in paras 69-70 of his opinion , said : `` 69 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	317	The adjective ` flagrant ' has been repeated in many statements where the court has kept open the possibility of engagement of articles of the Convention other than article 3 , a number of which are enumerated in para 24 of the opinion of Lord Bingham of Cornhill in the present appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	318	The concept of a flagrant breach or violation may not always be easy for domestic courts to apply - one is put in mind of the difficulties which they have had in applying that of gross negligence - but it seems to me that it was well expressed by the Immigration Appeal Tribunal in Devaseelan v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2003 -RSB- Imm AR 1 , 34 , para 111 , when it applied the criterion that the right in question would be completely denied or nullified in the destination country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	319	This would harmonise with the concept of a fundamental breach , with which courts in this jurisdiction are familiar . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	320	70 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	321	If it could be said that in principle article 9 is capable of engagement , it does not seem to me that the case of either appellant comes within the possible parameters of a flagrant , gross or fundamental breach of that article such as to amount to a denial or nullification of the rights conferred by it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	322	I accordingly agree that both appeals should be dismissed . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	323	The difficulty of resisting removal in reliance on article 9 was evidenced by the rejection of the appellants ' claims on the facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	324	In Razgar the answers given in Ullah were treated as laying down the relevant principles -LRB- paras 2 , 26 , 32 , 37 , 41-42 , 66 , 72 -RRB- although opinion was divided on the application of those principles to the facts of that case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	325	The threshold test 34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	326	It was not submitted in argument that the threshold test laid down in Ullah misrepresented or understated the effect of the Strasbourg authority as it stood then or stands now . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	327	It is true , as Carnwath LJ pointed out in the Court of Appeal -LRB- para 38 -RRB- , that different expressions have at different times been used to describe the test , but these have been used to describe the same test , not to lay down a different test . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	328	Nor , as I would understand the joint partly dissenting opinion of Judges Bratza , Bonello and Hedigan in Mamatkulov and Askarov v Turkey -LRB- 2005 -RRB- 41 EHRR 494 , 537 , para OIII 14 , did they envisage a different test when they said , with reference to article 6 -LRB- omitting footnotes -RRB- : `` While the court has not to date found that the expulsion or extradition of an individual violated , or would if carried out violate , article 6 of the Convention , it has on frequent occasions held that such a possibility can not be excluded where the person being expelled has suffered or risks suffering a flagrant denial of a fair trial in the receiving country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	329	What constitutes a ` flagrant ' denial of justice has not been fully explained in the court 's jurisprudence but the use of the adjective is clearly intended to impose a stringent test of unfairness going beyond mere irregularities or lack of safeguards in the trial procedures such as might result in a breach of article 6 if occurring within the Contracting State itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	330	As the court has emphasised , article 1 can not be read as justifying a general principle to the effect that a Contracting State may not surrender an individual unless satisfied that the conditions awaiting him in the country of destination are in full accord with each of the safeguards of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	331	In our view , what the word ` flagrant ' is intended to convey is a breach of the principles of fair trial guaranteed by article 6 which is so fundamental as to amount to a nullification , or destruction of the very essence , of the right guaranteed by that article . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	332	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	333	In adopting and endorsing the test formulated by the AIT in Devaseelan I did not in para 24 of my opinion in Ullah -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 2 AC 323 understand that tribunal to be distinguishing a `` flagrant denial or gross violation '' of a right from a complete denial or nullification of it but rather to be assimilating those expressions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	334	This was how the point had been put to the House by the Attorney General for the Secretary of State , as is evidenced from the report of his argument -LRB- p 337D -RRB- : `` If other articles can be engaged the threshold test will require a flagrant breach of the relevant right , such as will completely deny or nullify the right in the destination country : see Devaseelan v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2003 -RSB- Imm AR 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	335	A serious or discriminatory interference with the right protected would be insufficient . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	336	It is difficult , with respect , to see how the point could be put more clearly , and any attempt at paraphrase runs the risk of causing confusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	337	The right to respect for family life 36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	338	The importance of the right to respect for family life has been recognised in Strasbourg and domestic jurisprudence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	339	The Strasbourg case law has recognised the bond which arises at birth between child and parent -LRB- Ahmut v Netherlands -LRB- 1996 -RRB- 24 EHRR 62 , para 60 -RRB- and reference has been repeatedly made to `` the mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other 's company '' as `` a fundamental element of family life '' -LRB- McMichael v United Kingdom -LRB- 1995 -RRB- 20 EHRR 205 , para 86 ; Johansen v Norway -LRB- 1996 -RRB- 23 EHRR 33 , para 52 ; Bronda v Italy -LRB- 1998 -RRB- 33 EHRR 81 , para 51 ; P , C and S v United Kingdom -LRB- 2002 -RRB- 35 EHRR 1075 , para 113 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	340	Judge Martens , in a dissenting judgment , has described the right to care for one 's own children as `` a fundamental element of an elementary human right '' -LRB- Gül v Switzerland -LRB- 1996 -RRB- 22 EHRR 93 , 120 , para 12 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	341	More general statements are found in the domestic case law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	342	In M v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions -LSB- 2006 -RSB- UKHL 11 , -LSB- 2006 -RSB- 2 AC 91 , para 5 , reference was made to `` the love , trust , confidence , mutual dependence and unconstrained social intercourse which are the essence of family life '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	343	In Huang v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2007 -RSB- UKHL 11 , -LSB- 2007 -RSB- 2 AC 167 , para 18 , it was said : `` Human beings are social animals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	344	They depend on others . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	345	Their family , or extended family , is the group on which many people most heavily depend , socially , emotionally and often financially . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	346	There comes a point at which , for some , prolonged and unavoidable separation from this group seriously inhibits their ability to live full and fulfilling lives '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	347	My noble and learned friend Baroness Hale has said -LRB- In re B -LRB- Children -RRB- -LRB- Care Proceedings : Standard of Proof -RRB- -LRB- CAFCASS intervening -RRB- -LSB- 2008 -RSB- UKHL 35 , -LSB- 2008 -RSB- 3 WLR 1 , para 20 -RRB- that `` Taking a child away from her family is a momentous step , not only for her , but for her whole family ... '' 37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	348	Families differ widely , in their composition and in the mutual relations which exist between the members , and marked changes are likely to occur over time within the same family . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	349	Thus there is no pre-determined model of family or family life to which article 8 must be applied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	350	The article requires respect to be shown for the right to such family life as is or may be enjoyed by the particular applicant or applicants before the court , always bearing in mind -LRB- since any family must have at least two members , and may have many more -RRB- the participation of other members who share in the life of that family . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	351	In this context , as in most Convention contexts , the facts of the particular case are crucial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	352	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	353	The question to be determined in this appeal is accordingly this : whether , on the particular facts of this case , the removal of the appellant and AF to Lebanon will so flagrantly violate her , his and their article 8 rights as to completely deny or nullify those rights there . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	354	This is , as Ms Carss-Frisk QC for the Secretary of State emphasised , a very hard test to satisfy , never found to be satisfied in respect of any of the qualified Convention rights in any reported Strasbourg decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	355	The present case 39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	356	It seems likely that , following her marriage , the appellant 's immediate family consisted of herself and her husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	357	It would have been the life of that family which would have fallen within the purview of article 8 had the Convention applied in Lebanon , which it did -LRB- and does -RRB- not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	358	But there has been no familial contact between the appellant and her husband since the birth of AF , and AF has never seen his father since the day he was born . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	359	Nor has he had any contact with any of his father 's relatives . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	360	Thus , realistically , the only family which exists now or has existed for the last five years at least consists of the appellant and AF . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	361	It is the life of that family which is in issue : Beoku-Betts v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2008 -RSB- UKHL 39 , -LSB- 2008 -RSB- 3 WLR 166 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	362	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	363	It is no doubt a feature of their family life together that the appellant renders for AF the sort of services which a mother ordinarily does render for a growing adolescent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
108	364	But it would be wrong to regard the relationship between the appellant and AF as simply one in which the mother renders services for the son . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	365	The evidence makes plain that the bond between the two is one of deep love and mutual dependence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	366	It can not be replaced by a new relationship between AF and a father who has inflicted physical violence and psychological injury on the mother , who has been sent to prison for failing to support him , whom he has never consciously seen and towards whom AF understandably feels strongly antagonistic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	367	Nor can it be replaced by a new relationship with an unknown member or members of the father 's family . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	368	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	369	Two members of the Court of Appeal , although taking no account of AF 's right , appear to have held that the appellant 's article 8 right would be flagrantly violated if she were returned to Lebanon , but felt unable to conclude that her right would be completely denied or nullified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	370	As indicated above , these expressions do not propound different tests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	371	But it is in my opinion clear that on return to Lebanon both the appellant 's and AF 's right to respect for their family life would not only be flagrantly violated but would also be completely denied and nullified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	372	In no meaningful sense could occasional supervised visits by the appellant to AF at a place other than her home , even if ordered -LRB- and there is no guarantee that they would be ordered -RRB- , be described as family life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	373	The effect of return would be to destroy the family life of the appellant and AF as it is now lived . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	374	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	375	Considerable emphasis was laid in argument for the appellant and the second interveners on the arbitrary and discriminatory character of the family law applied in Lebanon , and it is plain that this would fall foul of both article 8 and article 14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	376	But Lebanon is not a party to the European Convention , and this court has no standing to enforce observance of other international instruments to which Lebanon is party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	377	Its family law reflects a religious and cultural tradition which , in one form or another , is respected and observed throughout much of the world . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	378	This country has no general mandate to impose its own values on other countries who do not share them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	379	I would therefore question whether it would avail the appellant to rely on the arbitrary and discriminatory character of the Lebanese custody regime had she not shown , as in my opinion she has , that return to Lebanon would flagrantly violate , or completely deny and nullify , her and AF 's right to respect for their family life together . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	380	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	381	The Court of Appeal and the courts below were disadvantaged by the absence of representations on behalf of AF . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	382	The hearing before the House has underscored the importance of ascertaining and communicating to the court the views of a child such as AF . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	383	In the great majority of cases the interests of the child , although calling for separate consideration , are unlikely to differ from those of an applicant parent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	384	If there is a genuine conflict , separate representation may be called for , but advisers should not be astute to detect a conflict where the interests of parent and child are essentially congruent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	385	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	386	For these reasons I would allow the appeal , set aside the orders below and quash the Secretary of State 's decision . 	lord bingham	self	outcome	0.8	lord bingham

108	393	In the words of Judges Bratza , Bonello and Hedigan in Mamatkulov and Askarov v Turkey -LRB- 2005 -RRB- 41 EHRR 494 , 537 , para OIII 14 , `` . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham

108	396	what the word ` flagrant ' is intended to convey is a breach which is so fundamental as to amount to a nullification , or destruction of the very essence , of the right guaranteed `` So far as we are aware , Strasbourg has never yet found that test to be satisfied in a case where the breach of article 8 would take place in the foreign country to which a family is to be expelled , rather than as the result of the expulsion of one of its members -LRB- as in , eg , Al-Nashif v Bulgaria -LRB- 2002 -RRB- 36 EHRR 655 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	397	The possibility is , however , acknowledged , both in Bensaid v United Kingdom -LRB- 2001 -RRB- 33 EHRR 205 , 219-220 , paras 46-49 , and in the dissenting opinion of Judges Tulkens , Bonello and Spielmann in N v United Kingdom -LRB- Application No 16565/05 -RRB- -LRB- unreported -RRB- 27 May 2008 , p 31 , para 26 .

108	399	In this case , the only family life which this child has ever known is with his mother . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	400	If he were obliged to return to a country where he would inevitably be removed from her care , with only the possibility of supervised visits , then the very essence of his right to respect for his family life would be destroyed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	401	And it would be destroyed for reasons which could never be justified under article 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- because they are purely arbitrary and pay no regard to his interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	402	The violation of his right is in my view of greater weight than the violation of his mother 's right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	403	Children need to be brought up in a stable and loving home , preferably by parents who are committed to their interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	404	Disrupting such a home risks causing lasting damage to their development , damage which is different in kind from the damage done to a parent by the removal of her child , terrible though that can be . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	405	47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	406	That is what makes this case so different from the general run of child abduction cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	407	In the general run of such cases , a family life of some sort has been established in the country of origin and it is the abduction rather than the return which has interfered with that family life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	408	In this case there was no family life established in the Lebanon between this child and his father or his father 's family . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	409	A family lawyer in this country might raise an eyebrow at the fact that the mother was able to keep her child entirely away from his father . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham

108	411	Be that as it may , from the child 's point of view , we have to deal with the situation as it now is . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	412	To deprive him of his mother 's care and place him in the care of people who are complete strangers to him and who have shown so little concern for his welfare would be to deprive him of the only family life he has or has ever had . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
108	413	The discriminatory laws of Lebanon are the reason why that is a real risk in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	414	They are also the reason why the interference can not be justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	415	But it is the effect upon the essence of the child 's right with which we have to be concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	416	48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	417	It has been a great help to be able to consider this case from the child 's point of view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	418	In the oral hearing where we considered the child 's application to intervene , the Secretary of State acknowledged that the child might have a separate article 8 claim of his own . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	419	Our recent decisions in Beoku-Betts v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2008 -RSB- UKHL 39 , -LSB- 2008 -RSB- 3 WLR 166 and Chikwamba v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2008 -RSB- UKHL 40 , -LSB- 2008 -RSB- 1 WLR 1420 have made it clear that , not only the Secretary of State , but also the asylum and immigration appeal tribunal , must take account of the article 8 rights of all those who are affected by their decisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	420	This means , as Lord Bingham says in para 43 of his opinion , that they call for separate consideration . 	lady hale	lord bingham	partagr	0.9	lord bingham
108	421	49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	422	Separate consideration and separate representation are , however , two different things . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	423	Questions may have to be asked about the situation of other family members , especially children , and about their views . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	424	It can not be assumed that the interests of all the family members are identical . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	425	In particular , a child is not to be held responsible for the moral failures of either of his parents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	426	Sometimes , further information may be required . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	427	If the Child and Family Court Advisory and Support Service or , more probably , the local children 's services authority can be persuaded to help in difficult cases , then so much the better . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	428	But in most immigration situations , unlike many ordinary abduction cases , the interests of different family members are unlikely to be in conflict with one another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	429	Separate legal -LRB- or other -RRB- representation will rarely be called for . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	430	50 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	431	For these reasons , which are merely a family lawyer 's post-script to those given by Lord Bingham , I too would allow this appeal . 	lady hale	lord bingham	fullagr	0.9	lord bingham

108	432	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	433	LORD CARSWELL 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	434	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	435	51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	436	I have had the advantage of reading in draft the opinion prepared by my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill . 	lord carswell	lord bingham	ackn	0.9	lord bingham
108	437	I agree so entirely with his reasons and conclusions that it would be superfluous to do more than add a few observations of my own . 	lord carswell	lord bingham	fullagr	0.9	lord bingham
108	438	52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	439	In deciding this appeal by the application of article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights the House is applying the domestic law of this country , as it is bound to do . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	440	We have to do so by reference to the values enshrined in the Convention , the common values of the states who are members of the Council of Europe . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	441	We are not passing judgment on the law or institutions of any other state . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	442	Nor are we setting out to make comparisons , favourable or unfavourable , with Shari'a law , which prevails in many countries , reflecting , as Lord Bingham has said -LRB- para 42 -RRB- , the religious and cultural tradition of those countries . 	lord carswell	lord bingham	partagr	0.9	lord bingham
108	443	For this reason I share the doubts expressed by Lord Bingham and by my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead about the appellant 's right to rely on a claim of discrimination under article 14 of the Convention . 	lord carswell	lord bingham	partagr	0.9	lord bingham
108	443	For this reason I share the doubts expressed by Lord Bingham and by my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead about the appellant 's right to rely on a claim of discrimination under article 14 of the Convention . 	lord carswell	lord hope	partagr	0.9	lord bingham
108	444	I am satisfied , on the other hand , that she has established a good claim under article 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	445	53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	446	Where the Court of Appeal went wrong was in misinterpreting the expressions of opinion of the House in R -LRB- Ullah -RRB- v Special Adjudicator -LSB- 2004 -RSB- UKHL 26 , -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 2 AC 323 and R -LRB- Razgar -RRB- v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2004 -RSB- UKHL 27 , -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 2 AC 368 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	447	The test to be applied in this case , which belongs to the class described as `` foreign cases '' , is whether the action of the United Kingdom authorities in removing the appellant to Lebanon would constitute a flagrant breach of her rights contained in article 8 of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	448	The Court of Appeal concluded that for the test to be satisfied the appellant 's article 8 rights had to be completely denied or nullified , with the consequence that if she retained any vestige of those rights her claim must fail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	449	That formula is excessively restrictive and sets the bar too high . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	450	54 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	451	I entirely agree with Lord Bingham -LRB- para 35 -RRB- that any attempt at paraphrase of the test runs the risk of causing confusion , and I do not propose to make any such attempt . 	lord carswell	lord bingham	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	452	It is instructive , however , to re-examine what the members of the Appellate Committee said in Ullah and Razgar , which will reaffirm that the correct test -LRB- as set out in Mamatkulov and Askarov v Turkey -LRB- 2005 -RRB- 41 EHRR 494 -RRB- is the destruction of the very essence of the right guaranteed by article 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	453	55 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	454	The members of the Committee in Ullah were all in agreement in their approach to the test to be applied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	455	Lord Bingham at para 24 referred with approval to the formula of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal in Devaseelan v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2002 -RSB- UKIAT 702 , -LSB- 2003 -RSB- Imm AR 1 , para 111 : `` The reason why flagrant denial or gross violation is to be taken into account is that it is only in such a case -- where the right will be completely denied or nullified in the destination country -- that it can be said that removal will breach the treaty obligations of the signatory state however those obligations might be interpreted or whatever might be said by or on behalf of the destination state . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	456	It may be noted , however , that he did so in the same paragraph as his consideration of the test applied under articles 2 and 3 of the Convention , defined by the European Court of Human rights as a `` near-certainty '' or `` real risk '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	457	Lord Steyn stated in para 50 , after a review of the Strasbourg case-law : `` It will be apparent from the review of Strasbourg jurisprudence that , where other articles may become engaged , a high threshold test will always have to be satisfied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	458	It will be necessary to establish at least a real risk of a flagrant violation of the very essence of the right before other articles could become engaged . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	459	56 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	460	In para 69 of my opinion in Ullah I also expressed approval of the IAT 's formulation of the test in Devaseelan , but added significantly that this would harmonise with the concept of a fundamental breach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
108	461	In Razgar -LRB- which was heard along with Ullah -RRB- at para 72 I used the phrase `` a very grave state of affairs , amounting to a flagrant or fundamental breach of the article , which in effect constitutes a complete denial of his rights '' -LRB- emphasis added -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham
108	462	I returned to the topic in Government of the United States of America v Montgomery -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 2004 -RSB- UKHL 37 , -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 1 WLR 2241 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham
108	463	In para 26 of my opinion , with which the other members of the House agreed , I stated : `` In the Ullah case and the Razgar case the House accepted the validity of these propositions , but also underlined the extreme degree of unfairness which would have to be established for an applicant to make out a case of indirect effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham
108	464	It was of opinion that it would have to amount to a virtually complete denial or nullification of his article 6 rights , which might be expressed in terms familiar to lawyers in this jurisdiction as a fundamental breach of the obligations contained in the article . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham
108	465	57 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham
108	466	It may be seen from the expressions of opinion which I have quoted that it was not the intention of the House in either Ullah or Razgar to define the standard of flagrancy in the absolute terms adopted by the Court of Appeal in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham
108	467	This accords with the views of Judges Bratza , Bonello and Hedigan in Mamatkulov -LRB- 2005 -RRB- 41 EHRR 494 , para OIII 14 , quoted by Lord Bingham at para 34 above , where they expressed the test in familiar Strasbourg terms of `` destruction of the very essence '' of the right guaranteed . 	lord carswell	lord bingham	partagr	1	lord bingham
108	468	The test therefore remains as set out in Ullah and Razgar and does not require redefinition or paraphrase , still less amendment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham
108	469	If correctly applied it forms a correct and workable means of determining `` foreign cases '' , though it remains clear that it is a stringent test , which will only be satisfied in very exceptional cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham
108	470	58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham
108	471	When it comes to applying it in the present case , I have no hesitation in reaching the conclusion , for the reasons summarised by Lord Bingham in paras 39 and 40 , that the appellant 's article 8 rights would be flagrantly violated if she were removed to Lebanon . 	lord carswell	lord bingham	partagr	1	lord bingham
108	472	The facts of the case are very exceptional and , as my noble and learned friend Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood says , provide compelling humanitarian grounds against removal . 	lord carswell	lord brown	partagr	1	lord bingham
108	473	I should be prepared so to hold even without taking into account the effect upon the child AF , but when that is added into the scale -- as it is now clear that it should be taken into account - the conclusion is even more clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham
108	474	59 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham
108	475	I would therefore allow the appeal . 	lord carswell	self	outcome	1	lord bingham

108	482	I agree not least with what Lord Bingham says in para 42 of his opinion , a view echoed in paras 14 and 15 of Lord Hope 's opinion . 	lord brown	lord hope	NAN	1	lord bingham
108	483	It is certainly not the arbitrary and discriminatory character of the rule of Sharia law dictating that at the age of seven a child 's physical custody automatically passes from the mother to the father -LRB- or another male member of his family -RRB- -- wholly incompatible though such a rule is with certain of the basic principles underlying the Convention -- which , uniquely thus far in the jurisprudence both of Strasbourg and the UK courts , qualifies this particular `` foreign '' case as one for protection under article 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham
108	484	Rather it is the highly exceptional facts of the case -LRB- as set out in my Lords ' opinions -RRB- which in combination provide utterly compelling humanitarian grounds against removal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham
