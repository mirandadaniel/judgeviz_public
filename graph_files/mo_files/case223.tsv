223	1	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	2	LORD HOFFMANN 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	4	Summary 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	5	The question is whether someone who has been negligently exposed to asbestos in the course of his employment can sue his employer for damages on the ground that he has developed pleural plaques . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	6	These are areas of fibrous thickening of the pleural membrane which surrounds the lungs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	7	Save in very exceptional cases , they cause no symptoms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	8	Nor do they cause other asbestos-related diseases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	9	But they signal the presence in the lungs and pleura of asbestos fibres which may independently cause life-threatening or fatal diseases such as asbestosis or mesothelioma . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	10	In consequence , a diagnosis of pleural plaques may cause the patient to contemplate his future with anxiety or even suffer clinical depression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	11	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	12	Proof of damage is an essential element in a claim in negligence and in my opinion the symptomless plaques are not compensatable damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	13	Neither do the risk of future illness or anxiety about the possibility of that risk materialising amount to damage for the purpose of creating a cause of action , although the law allows both to be taken into account in computing the loss suffered by someone who has actually suffered some compensatable physical injury and therefore has a cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	14	In the absence of such compensatable injury , however , there is no cause of action under which damages may be claimed and therefore no computation of loss in which the risk and anxiety may be taken into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	15	It follows that in my opinion the development of pleural plaques , whether or not associated with the risk of future disease and anxiety about the future , is not actionable injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	16	The same is true even if the anxiety causes a recognised psychiatric illness such as clinical depression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	17	The right to protection against psychiatric illness is limited and does not extend to an illness which would be suffered only by an unusually vulnerable person because of apprehension that he may suffer a tortious injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	18	The risk of the future disease is not actionable and neither is a psychiatric illness caused by contemplation of that risk . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	19	The earlier rulings 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	20	In the 1980s the actionability of pleural plaques was considered in three decisions at first instance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	21	In all three cases the judges found in favour of the plaintiffs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	22	But their reasoning was not altogether consistent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	23	The first case was Church v Ministry of Defence -LRB- 1984 -RRB- 134 NLJ 623 , an action by a fitter who had until 1954 worked with asbestos in the naval dockyard at Chatham . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	24	A routine X-ray in 1980 revealed pleural plaques . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	25	Peter Pain J said -LRB- at p. 6 -RRB- that it was `` an error to treat the pleural plaques on their own . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	26	There was , he said , damage caused `` by the asbestos passing through the lungs and causing the plaques to form . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	27	Adding that to the plaques themselves , it was not damage `` so minor that the law should disregard it . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	28	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	29	A month later Otton J gave judgment in a similar case -LRB- Sykes v Ministry of Defence The Times , 23 March 1984 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	30	The plaintiff had worked with asbestos in the naval dockyard at Portsmouth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	31	The judge was referred to the decision of Peter Pain J in the Church case but his reasoning was not quite the same . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	32	In the opinion of Otton J , there was no need to add anything to the plaques to produce compensatable damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	33	It was enough that there had been a `` definite change in the structure of the pleura '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	34	That gave the plaintiff a cause of action and therefore , in calculating the damages , one could take into account the risk of other diseases and the plaintiff 's anxiety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	35	As the judge awarded a global sum of # 1,500 damages for `` the three elements of physical damage , anxiety and the risks of further complications '' , he did not have to explain how he would have calculated damages for the symptomless plaques alone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	36	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	37	Patterson v Ministry of Defence -LSB- 1987 -RSB- CLY 1194 was another similar case from the naval dockyard at Chatham . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	38	Simon Brown J did not accept that a `` symptom-free physiological change '' such as a plaque was an actionable injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	39	If Otton J had decided the contrary , he disagreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	40	But the plaques together with the risk of future disease and anxiety could add up to a cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	41	The reasoning of Simon Brown J was therefore based upon what was called , in argument before your Lordships , a theory of aggregation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	42	The proposition was that a physiological change which is not compensatable damage can be aggregated with risk and anxiety -LRB- neither of which would by themselves give rise to a cause of action -RRB- to create a cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	43	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	44	Since these decisions , claims have regularly been settled on the basis that pleural plaques are actionable injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	45	But now the insurers have decided to challenge the practice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	46	Ten test cases were selected for trial before Holland J , who also found that the plaques were actionable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	47	In seven cases the insurers appealed to the Court of Appeal , which reversed the decision of the judge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	48	Four of the claimants now appeal to your Lordships ' House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	49	In order to decide the point , it is necessary to go back to first principles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	50	The concept of actionable damage 7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	51	Some causes of action arise without proof of damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	52	Trespass and breach of contract are examples . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	53	Proof of the trespass or breach of contract is enough to found a cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	54	If no actual damage is proved , the claimant is entitled to nominal damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	55	But a claim in tort based on negligence is incomplete without proof of damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	56	Damage in this sense is an abstract concept of being worse off , physically or economically , so that compensation is an appropriate remedy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	57	It does not mean simply a physical change , which is consistent with making one better , as in the case of a successful operation , or with being neutral , having no perceptible effect upon one 's health or capability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	58	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	59	How much worse off must one be ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	60	An action for compensation should not be set in motion on account of a trivial injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	61	De minimis non curat lex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	62	But whether an injury is sufficiently serious to found a claim for compensation or too trivial to justify a remedy is a question of degree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	63	Because people do not often go to the trouble of bringing actions to recover damages for trivial injuries , the question of how trivial is trivial has seldom arisen directly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	64	It has however arisen in connection with the Limitation Act , under which the primary rule is that time runs from the date on which the cause of action accrues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	65	In an action for negligence , that means the date upon which the claimant suffered damage which can not be characterised as trivial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	66	To identify that moment was the vital question in Cartledge v E Jopling & Sons Ltd -LSB- 1963 -RSB- AC 758 , in which the employees had suffered death or serious injury from damage to their lungs caused by exposure to fragmented silica . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	67	At a date earlier than the commencement of the limitation period their lungs had suffered damage which would have been visible upon an X-ray examination , reduced their lung capacity in a way which would show itself in cases of unusual exertion , might advance without further inhalation , made them more vulnerable to tuberculosis or bronchitis and reduced their expectation of life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	68	But in normal life the damage produced no symptoms and they were unaware of it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	69	The House of Lords affirmed the view of the trial judge and the Court of Appeal that a cause of action had arisen and the claims -LRB- as the law then stood -RRB- were statute-barred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	70	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	71	The members of the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords used slightly different words to express the degree of injury which must have been suffered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	72	In the Court of Appeal -LRB- -LSB- 1962 -RSB- 1 QB 189 -RRB- Harman LJ spoke -LRB- at p 199 -RRB- of loss or damage `` not being insignificant '' and Pearson LJ said -LRB- at p 208 -RRB- that the cause of action accrues when `` the plaintiff concerned has suffered serious harm '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	73	In the House of Lords -LRB- -LSB- 1963 -RSB- AC 758 -RRB- Lord Reid said -LRB- at pp 771-772 -RRB- that the cause of action accrues when the wrongful act has caused personal injury `` beyond what can be regarded as negligible '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	74	Lord Evershed -LRB- at p 774 -RRB- spoke of `` real damage as distinct from purely minimal damage '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	75	Lord Pearce -LRB- with whom all the rest of their Lordships agreed -RRB- said -LRB- at p 779 -RRB- : Are pleural plaques actionable damage ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	76	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	77	Holland J found that the plaques in themselves were not damage which could found a cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	78	He said -LRB- at para 80a -RRB- : 11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	79	This finding of fact is in my opinion unassailable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	80	As the judge noted , the point was conceded by the claimants , who preferred to rely upon the aggregation theory adopted by Simon Brown J in Patterson v Ministry of Defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	81	The same concession was made in the Court of Appeal but withdrawn in the House of Lords . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	82	If the case lay on the borderline , I would have thought that the judge 's finding was open to him on the evidence and should not be disturbed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	83	But this was not a borderline case and I do not see how it was open to the judge , on the evidence , to come to any other conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	84	It was not merely that the plaques caused no immediate symptoms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	85	That was also the case in Cartledge v E Jopling & Sons Ltd -LSB- 1963 -RSB- AC 758 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	86	The important point was that , save in the most exceptional case , the plaques would never cause any symptoms , did not increase the susceptibility of the claimants to other diseases or shorten their expectation of life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	87	They had no effect upon their health at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	88	As the judge put it at para 64 : The aggregation theory 12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	89	If the pleural plaques are not in themselves damage , do they become damage when aggregated with the risk which they evidence or the anxiety which that risk causes ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	90	In principle , neither the risk of future injury nor anxiety at the prospect of future injury is actionable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	91	These propositions are established by the decisions of the House in Gregg v Scott -LSB- 2005 -RSB- 2 AC 176 and Hicks v Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police -LSB- 1992 -RSB- 2 All ER 65 respectively . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	92	How then can they be relied upon to create a cause of action which would not otherwise exist ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	93	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	94	The appellants ' argument is based upon the common law rule that if a claimant has suffered actionable personal injury as a result of the defendant 's breach of duty , he can and must claim damages in the same action for all the damage which he has suffered or will suffer in consequence of that breach of duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	95	As Bowen LJ said in Brunsden v Humphrey -LRB- 1884 -RRB- 14 QBD 141 , 148 : 14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	96	This `` single action rule '' is very old and for the protection of defendants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	97	Coke said that it was based upon the maxim interest rei publicae ut sit finis litium , `` otherwise great oppression might be done under colour and pretence of law '' : see Bowen LJ at p 147 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	98	A defendant should not have to answer more than once for the consequences of the same act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	99	A corollary of the rule is that if a claimant does have a cause of action , he may recover damages for the risk that he may suffer further injury in consequence of the same act of negligence , even though -LRB- under the principle in Gregg v Scott -RRB- , such risk would not be independently actionable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	100	There are also cases which suggest that he may be able to recover damages for anxiety consequent upon an actionable injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	101	But recovery is predicated upon the existence of actionable injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	102	There is nothing to suggest that a claimant can rely upon the single action rule to sue in circumstances in which he does not have a cause of action in the first place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	103	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	104	The rule was modified for personal injury actions by section 32A of the Supreme Court Act 1981 , inserted by section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Administration of Justice Act 1982 : 16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	105	This provision allows a claimant to elect for an award of provisional damages for the injury which he has already suffered and enables him to avoid having to quantify his damages for the chance of developing further injury in the future ; a calculation which is likely to result in his being either undercompensated -LRB- if the injury occurs -RRB- or overcompensated -LRB- if it does not -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	106	Most -LRB- though not all -RRB- of the claimants in these proceedings elected for provisional damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	107	But the statute does not support the aggregation theory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	108	On the contrary , its insistence that provisional damages can be obtained only when there is a chance that a serious disease will develop `` as a result of the act or omission which gave rise to the cause of action '' makes it clear that it applies only where the claimant has a cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	109	The judgment of the Court of Appeal 17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	110	For these reasons I would reject the aggregation theory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	111	The majority in the Court of Appeal , who also rejected it , placed some emphasis upon policy arguments of a consequentialist nature , based upon predictions of how people would behave if they could sue for pleural plaques . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	112	I am bound to say that some of these seemed to me rather speculative and I am inclined to agree with Smith LJ who said in her dissenting judgment -LRB- -LSB- 2006 -RSB- ICR 1458 , 1492 , para 112 -RRB- that `` the question can and should be answered by the application of established legal principle to a new factual situation '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	113	But I respectfully disagree with Smith LJ about that principle , which is , in my opinion , that in order to sue for personal injury you need a cause of action and that symptomless bodily changes with no foreseeable consequences , the risk of a disease which is not consequent upon those changes and anxiety about that risk are not , individually or collectively , damage giving rise to a cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	114	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	115	Smith LJ said that pleural plaques amounted to `` an injury '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	116	She gave two reasons : first , in rare cases plaques might -LRB- on account of the position in which they developed -RRB- cause symptoms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	117	In such a case the symptoms are not the injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	118	It is the plaque . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	119	That shows that the plaque is an injury and it must be an injury whether it causes symptoms or not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	120	Similarly , the plaque is a lesion to the pleura . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	121	A lesion to the body , for example , a disfiguring scar , would be a compensatable injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	122	That shows that a lesion is an injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	123	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	124	It seems to me , with respect , that Smith LJ asked herself the wrong question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	125	One is not concerned with whether the plaque is in some sense `` injury '' or -LRB- as she went on to decide -RRB- a `` disease '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	126	The question is whether the claimant has suffered damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	127	That means : is he appreciably worse off on account of having plaques ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	128	The rare victim whose plaques are causing symptoms is worse off on that account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	129	Likewise , the man with the disfiguring lesion is worse off because he is disfigured . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	130	In the usual case , however -LRB- including those of all the claimants in these proceedings -RRB- the plaques have no effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	131	They have not caused damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	132	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	133	Smith LJ also found support for the aggregation theory in section 32A of the Supreme Court Act 1981 , to which I have already referred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	134	She said -LRB- at p 1497 , para 133 -RRB- : 21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott

223	142	His case is different because he suffered not merely anxiety but clinical depression , a recognised psychiatric illness , in consequence of being told that his pleural plaques indicated a significant exposure to asbestos and the risk of future disease .

223	143	Unlike the kind of anxiety considered in Hicks v Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police -LSB- 1992 -RSB- 2 All ER 65 , psychiatric illness does constitute damage for the purpose of founding an action in negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	144	So the question in Mr Grieves 's case is a different one : not whether he suffered damage , but whether the defendants owed him a duty of care in respect of psychiatric illness caused by his anxiety at the risk of a future illness .

223	149	The question of whether he was owed a duty of care in respect of that illness must in my opinion by answered by reference to the principles stated by Hale LJ in her lucid and comprehensive judgment in Hatton v Sutherland -LSB- 2002 -RSB- ICR 613 , which were approved by this House in Barber v Somerset County Council -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 1 WLR 1089 .

223	153	She rejected the general applicability of the test of whether psychiatric injury was foreseeable in a person of `` ordinary fortitude '' because an employer 's duty was owed to each individual employee and not an undifferentiated member of the public .

223	178	In the case of psychiatric illness , the standard description of what should have been foreseen , namely that the event which actually happened would have caused psychiatric illness to a person of `` sufficient fortitude '' or `` customary phlegm '' , has been part of the law since the speech of Lord Porter in Bourhill v Young -LSB- 1943 -RSB- AC 92 , 117 .

223	233	There is no cosmetic deficit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott

223	244	There must be real damage , as distinct from damage which is purely minimal : Lord Evershed at p 774 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	245	Where that element is lacking , as it plainly is in the case of pleural plaques , the physical change which they represent is not by itself actionable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott

223	248	They maintain that the physical change ought not to be looked at in isolation from other consequences of their exposure to asbestos . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	249	In each case there was medical evidence that the presence of pleural plaques indicated that the claimants were at significantly increased risk of developing an asbestos-related disease which would be actionable - of developing asbestosis , mesothelioma or lung cancer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	250	There was also evidence from the claimants themselves , which the judge accepted , that they had suffered from anxiety on being told that they had pleural plaques and of the increased risks of developing these diseases due to the amount of asbestos fibres in their lungs which the presence of pleural plaques indicated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	251	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	252	The claimants accept that they have no free-standing claim for those increased risks , as it is not the pleural plaques themselves that gave rise to them : Gregg v Scott -LSB- 2005 -RSB- 2 AC 176 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	253	They also accept that they have no free-standing claim for their anxiety , which is mainly about their state of health in the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	254	Emotional reactions of that kind do not , on their own , sound in damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	255	But taken in combination , they say , these various elements when added together do add up to an injury caused by the wrongful exposure to asbestos which is more than negligible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	256	Even when the risk is discounted for the purpose of an award of provisional damages under section 32A of the Supreme Court Act 1981 , an award can , it is submitted , be given for an amount that is more than negligible for the anxiety when it is added to the physical alteration which gave rise to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	257	The physical change resulting from the presence in their lungs of asbestos fibres is the control mechanism or `` hook '' , to adopt Professor Jane Stapleton 's graphic metaphor -LRB- `` Cause-in-Fact and the Scope of Liability for Consequences '' -LRB- 2003 -RRB- LQR 388 , 424 -RRB- , on which they wish to hang their argument .

223	260	It is not possible , by adding together two or more components , none of which in itself is actionable , to arrive at something which is actionable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	261	It would be easy to say that , as the element of anxiety is simply parasitical on another element which on its own is not actionable , it can not in combination create something which is actionable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	262	But I do not think that this would do justice to what , on the evidence , is a genuine problem of legal analysis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	263	The claimants may never develop any of the harmful diseases which they are now at an increased risk of developing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	264	But they have already developed pleural plaques and it has been established that they are suffering from anxiety due to an awareness of what the pleural plaques indicate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	265	The respondents accept that if the claimants were to develop any of the harmful diseases they would then have a claim that was actionable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	266	But the award which that cause of action would produce would give them nothing for any anxiety which preceded the development of the disease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	267	And those who did not develop any of the harmful diseases would not ever , if the respondents are right , be able to recover anything for their anxiety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	268	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	269	The need to examine the problem more closely is indicated by the fact that , prior to this litigation , it was accepted by both lawyers and insurers working in this field that claimants who had developed pleural plaques were entitled to damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	270	As Smith LJ noted in the Court of Appeal -LSB- 2006 -RSB- ICR 1458 , para 128 , this was the result of a trilogy of cases in the 1980s involving the Ministry of Defence : Church v Ministry of Defence -LRB- unreported , 23 February 1984 -RRB- ; Sykes v Ministry of Defence -LRB- unreported , 19 March 1984 -RRB- ; Patterson v Ministry of Defence -LRB- unreported , 29 July 1986 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	271	In Patterson Simon Brown J said that he had no doubt that the plaintiff had suffered material damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	272	This consisted of the symptom-free pleural changes , the risk of the development of diseases that were harmful and what he described as the understandable worry attendant upon those various matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	273	In the present cases Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers CJ , speaking for the majority in the Court of Appeal , accepted that , if the claimants had sustained actionable physical injury , an award of provisional damages could properly reflect anxiety at the risk of sustaining a harmful disease consequent upon the breach of duty that caused the physical injury and that compensation for significant anxiety would normally be expected to fall within a bracket of # 4,000 to # 6,000 : -LSB- 2006 -RSB- ICR 1458 , para 107 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	274	The problem then is not due to the fact that it would not be possible , on this hypothesis , to arrive at an award which crossed the minimal threshold that the maxim de minimis non curat lex stipulates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	275	It is due to the fact that , on their own , the pleural plaques do not amount to an injury , or a disease , which is actionable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	276	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	277	Why should this be ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	278	The respondents say that the answer lies in an application of the de minimis test : the law ought not to concern itself with pleural plaques which in themselves are , at best for the claimants , a trivial injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	279	But the wording of the test itself is liable to mislead . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	280	It is not right to say that the law does not concern itself with matters of small moment or which are trivial in amount . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	281	The dishonest taking of an item of trivial value - a bun from the bakery , for example - is just as much theft as it is when the item taken is of high value . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	282	And in strict legal theory every wrong , however slight , attracts a remedy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	283	Every right , of whatever value , may be enforced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	284	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	285	Two Scottish authorities illustrate this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	286	In Meikle v Sneddon -LRB- 1862 -RRB- 24 D 720 the pursuers claimed damages for the wrongful arrestment of their ship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	287	They claimed # 500 as solatium for injury to their feelings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	288	But the only loss that had been actually sustained was the sum required to relieve the vessel from the arrestment , which was less than # 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	289	Lord Justice-Clerk Inglis said at p 723 : In Strang v Steuart -LRB- 1864 -RRB- 2 M 1015 the same judge lamented the amount of court time that had been taken by what he described at p 1029 as a foolish and absurd litigation about a hedge and ditch that separated the parties ' properties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	290	But he held nevertheless that it was the duty of the court to deal with the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	291	46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	292	On the other hand , in Wood v Carwardine -LSB- 1923 -RSB- 2 KB185 McCardie J held that trivial services , the amount of which could be measured , did not amount to `` attendance '' within the meaning of section 12 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- i -RRB- of the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest -LRB- Restrictions -RRB- Act 1920 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	293	At p 192 he said that the rule had to be applied with robust vigour in favour of the tenant unless the protective object of the Act was to be substantially defeated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	294	He referred to observations on the maxim in the same context by Bankes LJ in Wilkes v Goodwin -LSB- 1923 -RSB- 2 KB 86 , 93-94 , and said that the question of substantiality was an important matter in dealing with the rule . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	295	47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	296	Whatever its strict meaning may be , the maxim in its less literal sense can be appealed to in the present context as an expression of legal policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	297	It is well settled in cases where a wrongful act has caused personal injury there is no cause of action if the damage suffered was negligible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	298	In strict legal theory a wrong has been done whenever a breach of the duty of care results in a demonstrable physical injury , however slight . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	299	But the policy of the law is not to entertain a claim for damages where the physical effects of the injury are no more than negligible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	300	Otherwise the smallest cut , or the lightest bruise , might give rise to litigation the costs of which were out of all proportion to what was in issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	301	The policy does not provide clear guidance as to where the line is to be drawn between effects which are and are not negligible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	302	But it can at least be said that an injury which is without any symptoms at all because it can not be seen or felt and which will not lead to some other event that is harmful has no consequences that will attract an award of damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	303	Damages are given for injuries that cause harm , not for injuries that are harmless . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	304	48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	305	In her dissenting judgment , to which I should like to pay tribute , Smith LJ said that the tissue change resulting from the development of the pleural plaques was a physical injury or a disease and that the cause of action was complete when account was taken of the risks of a harmful disease caused by the same exposure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	306	This was on the view that time began to run against the claimant for the purposes of limitation when the plaques were discovered and he was told about the risks : para 134 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	307	She did not think that it was necessary to include any element of anxiety when deciding whether the cause of action was complete . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	308	But anxiety could be brought into account in the award of damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	309	In summary , she said , the sum of the very minor physical damage and the much more serious damage comprising the risks amounted to material , actionable damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	310	49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	311	This approach does not seem to me , however , to address the fundamental point that , while the pleural plaques can be said to amount to an injury or a disease , neither the injury nor the disease was in itself harmful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	312	This is not a case where a claim of low value requires the support of other elements to make it actionable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	313	It is a claim which has no value at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	314	Pleural plaques are a form of injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	315	But they are not harmful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	316	They do not give rise to any symptoms , nor do they lead to anything else which constitutes damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	317	Furthermore it is not possible to bring the risks of developing a harmful disease into account by applying the ordinary rules of causation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	318	The risks are no doubt due to the same exposure to asbestos . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	319	But they are not created by , or in any way contributed to , by the pleural plaques . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	320	That can also be said of the anxiety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	321	It is the risk of developing a harmful disease in the future that gives rise to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	322	So also where the claimant is required to attend for periodical medical examination and is worried about the results . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	323	Pleural plaques themselves do not require periodical medical attention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	324	The need for this is due to what the pleural plaques indicate about the extent of the exposure to asbestos . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	325	50 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	326	I am not attracted by the other reasons of policy that led the majority in the Court of Appeal to the conclusion that it was undesirable that the development of pleural plaques should give rise to a cause of action : para 67 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	327	I would hold however that there is no cause of action because the pleural plaques in themselves do not give rise to any harmful physical effects which can be said to constitute damage , and because of the absence of a direct causative link between them and the risks and the anxiety which , on their own , are not actionable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	328	I would apply the same proposition for the purposes of the limitation rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	329	Time has not yet begun to run against any of the claimants who may have the misfortune of developing an asbestos-related disease in the future which is actionable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	330	Mr Grieves 's case 51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	331	Mr Grieves is in a different position , because he developed psychological symptoms and was diagnosed as suffering from a depressive illness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	332	He also developed irritable bowel syndrome as a result of his clinical depression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	333	So he claims damages for his depressive illness and his irritable bowel syndrome as well as for his contraction of pleural plaques . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	334	He claims that all these consequences should be aggregated to give him a cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	335	He also claims , in the alternative , that as he was exposed to a foreseeable risk of injury by exposure to asbestos dust he is entitled to recover damages for psychiatric injury suffered in consequence of that breach of duty .

223	336	52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	337	On his first argument Mr Grieves seeks to bring his case within the ratio of Page v Smith -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 155 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	338	He maintains that he was a primary victim of the respondents ' negligence in exposing him to asbestos dust . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	339	So it was not necessary in his case to ask whether the respondents should have foreseen that he , as person of normally robust constitution , would suffer psychiatric injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	340	The respondents advanced various criticisms of that case which , as is well known , has given rise to much controversy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	341	They invited the House to depart from that decision and to hold that , as in the case where damages are sought for physical injury , foreseeability of psychiatric injury should be the test for the recovery of damages by those who suffer psychiatric injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	342	The effect would be to restore to this branch of the law the principle that was laid down by the Privy Council in Overseas Tankship -LRB- UK -RRB- ltd v Morts Dock & Engineering Co Ltd -LRB- The Wagon Mound -LRB- No 1 -RRB- -RRB- -LSB- 1961 -RSB- AC 388 , 426 , that the essential factor in determining liability for the consequences of an act of negligence is foreseeability of the damage that is complained of . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	343	Attractive though that argument is , I would prefer to leave it for another day . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	344	On the facts of Mr Grieves 's case , Page v Smith is distinguishable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	345	53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	346	There are two reasons for taking this view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	347	First , the factor that precipitated Mr Grieves 's psychiatric illness was not a stressful event caused by the breach of duty , such as the accident which gave rise to Mr Page 's nervous shock . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	348	As Dr Rajiv Menon , a consultant psychiatrist , records in his report , Mr Grieves had a long-standing , anticipatory fear of developing an asbestos related disease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	349	But he did not become ill until he was told that slight pleural thickening had been detected when his chest was X-rayed in August 2000 , more than 20 years after the date when he was last exposed to asbestos dust . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott

223	351	In Frost v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 455 , 500 , Lord Steyn said that , in view of the difficulties that they gave rise to , the only prudent course was to treat the categories as reflected in authoritative decisions such as Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police -LSB- 1992 -RSB- 1 AC 310 and Page v Smith -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 155 as settled for the time being but to leave any expansion of this corner of the law to Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	352	In Frost it was argued unsuccessfully that the plaintiffs were entitled to succeed as rescuers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	353	Although the issue in that case was whether they could be classified as secondary victims , I would apply Lord Steyn 's cautionary advice to the present case too . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	354	The labels that were identified in Page v Smith should not be extended beyond what was in contemplation in that case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	355	The category of primary victim should be confined to persons who suffer psychiatric injury caused by fear or distress resulting from involvement in an accident caused by the defendant 's negligence or its immediate aftermath . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	356	A person like Mr Grieves who suffers psychiatric injury because of something that he may experience in the future as a result of the defendant 's past negligence is in an entirely different category . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	357	The immediacy that is characteristic of the situation that applies to primary victims as contemplated in Page v Smith -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 155 is lacking in his case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	358	55 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	359	Secondly , the causal chain between his inhalation of the asbestos dust and the psychiatric injury is stretched far beyond that which was envisaged in Page v Smith -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 155 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	360	That case was concerned with an immediate response to a sudden and alarming accident , for the consequences of which the plaintiff had no opportunity to prepare himself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	361	In this case Mr Grieves inhaled asbestos dust for about eight years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	362	It was not until the end of that period that he became worried . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	363	This was because of the risk that he or his wife or daughter might contract a disease in the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	364	And his depression did not occur until he was told twenty years later about the results of his chest X-ray . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	365	He believed then that his worst fears were being realised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	366	But this was because of the information that he had now been given by his doctor , not because of anything that happened or was done to him by his employers while he was inhaling the asbestos . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	367	His exposure at work was not to stress , but to risk : Sarah Green , `` Risk Exposure and Negligence '' -LSB- 2006 -RSB- 122 LQR 386 , 389 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	368	56 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	369	It was submitted that Mr Grieves 's case fell within the scope of the decision of this House in Simmons v British Steel plc -LSB- 2004 -RSB- ICR 585 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	370	It was held that the pursuer in that case was in the position of a primary victim of the defendant 's negligence : paras 21 , 55 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	371	But in that case the pursuer suffered a severe blow to his head in the same accident which gave rise to a number of significant physical symptoms that lasted for several weeks . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	372	His psychiatric illness was the result of a dermatological condition that he developed because he was angry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	373	That anger had several causes , one of which was the fact that the accident had happened . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	374	So the pursuer was within the category of persons who suffer psychiatric injury caused by fear or distress resulting from involvement in an accident caused by the defendant 's negligence or in its immediate aftermath . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	375	His situation was very different from that of Mr Grieves , whose case falls well outside that category . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	376	57 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	377	The alternative argument is that Mr Grieves 's psychiatric injury was not arbitrarily related to the finding of pleural plaques but was reasonably foreseeable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	378	The judge , Holland J , was not persuaded that it was a foreseeable consequence of the defendants ' breach of duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	379	The majority in the Court of Appeal were unanimous in their view that there was no material that would enable them to make such a finding : -LSB- 2006 -RSB- ICR 1458 , paras 76 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	380	On the view that she took of the case Smith LJ did not need to deal with this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	381	I agree with the majority that the evidence in this case does not support a finding that Mr Grieves 's psychiatric illness was reasonably foreseeable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	382	That complication arose in his case because he had had long-standing , anticipatory fears of developing an asbestos-related disease ever since he had learnt about the dangers of exposure some decades previously . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott

223	386	Furthermore , all the factors which take Mr Grieves 's case beyond the category of cases that was envisaged in Page v Smith -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 155 are relevant to this argument also . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott

223	388	The circumstances that led up to its development were far removed from anything that happened or could reasonably have been foreseen at that time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	389	The question of what was reasonably foreseeable is approached with the benefit of hindsight , in the light of what actually happened : Page v Smith -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 4 All ER 522 , 549 , per Hoffmann LJ . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott

223	391	In The Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease Litigation Group B Plaintiffs v The Medical Research Council -LSB- 2000 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep Med 161 , 166 Morland J held that the circumstances were such that the defendants should have reasonably foreseen the risk of a patient developing psychiatric injury as a result of receiving news and information about the consequences and effects of CJD by 1 July 1977 , prior to the date when the patients received the treatment that proved to be harmful .

223	406	61 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	407	These conjoined appeals arise out of litigation brought by the appellants against their respective former employers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	408	Each appellant complains that during his employment he was exposed by his employer to asbestos dust and that , as a consequence of the exposure , he inhaled asbestos fibres which remain in his lungs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	409	Asbestos fibres in the lungs can lead to mesothelioma or asbestosis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	410	These are very serious life threatening diseases that can emerge many years after the exposure to asbestos dust has ceased . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	411	Medical science has not found any means of forestalling the onset of these diseases once the asbestos fibres have been inhaled . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	412	The unfortunate individual who has inhaled the fibres must simply wait and hope for the best . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	413	62 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	414	None of the appellants has yet contracted any asbestos related disease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	415	It is to be hoped that none will do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	416	But each of them , ever since his exposure to asbestos dust , has had to live with the risk , a risk estimated by the medical experts who have given evidence in these cases to be in the region of a five per cent chance , and will have to continue to live with that risk until he dies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	417	The effect of the shadow cast by this risk on those who must live under it varies from individual to individual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	418	Some people are more prone to worry than others . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	419	One of the appellants , Mr Grieves , has worried about the risk to the point where he has developed psychological symptoms and a depressive illness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	420	63 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	421	Medical examinations of each of the appellants have revealed that inhaled asbestos fibres have made their way to the pleural membrane which surrounds the lungs and have there formed themselves into plaques . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	422	Pleural plaques are characteristic of asbestos exposure but are in themselves asymptomatic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	423	Their presence , and their size and number , provide an indication of the extent to which the individual has inhaled asbestos fibres but are not themselves causative of asbestos related disease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	424	They cause neither impairment of lung function nor disablement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	425	But because they are proof of the presence in the lungs of asbestos fibres they are an indicator of the extent to which the individual is at risk of developing in the future some such disease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	426	The diagnosis of the presence of pleural plaques may , therefore , contribute to or heighten the anxiety of the individual that he may develop a life-threatening asbestos related disease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	427	64 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	428	Each of the appellants has sued the employer , or in some cases employers , who exposed him to asbestos dust . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	429	Damages in negligence are claimed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	430	And it is accepted by each of the employers , respondents before your Lordships , that the exposure represented a breach of the duty each owed to its employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	431	The appellants ' claims , however , are tortious claims based on breach of a tortious duty of care or breach of statutory duty - no distinction between these duties has been , or need be , drawn - and the employers have resisted the claims on the ground that as yet none of the appellants has suffered actionable damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	432	It is accepted that if and when an appellant contracts an asbestos related disease , when , that is to say , the risk under which he is living actually materialises , his employers will be liable to him in damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	433	But that point has not yet been reached . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	434	The present actions are premature , so the respondents , or more accurately their insurers , contend . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	435	The issue for your Lordships is whether that is right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	436	Holland J , who tried the case , thought it was not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	437	In the Court of Appeal Smith LJ agreed with him , but the majority , Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers and Longmore LJ , disagreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	438	They allowed the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	439	The issues now for your Lordships to decide , are , first , whether the presence in the lungs of pleural plaques , a result of the inhalation of asbestos fibres brought about by the exposure of the appellants to asbestos dust , an exposure admitted to constitute a breach of the respondents ' duty to them , entitles the appellants to bring an action in tort for damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	440	The second issue , if the answer to the first is that the presence of pleural plaques is not enough , is whether that presence coupled with the anxiety , produced by knowledge of the risks attendant upon a past exposure to asbestos dust and accentuated by knowledge of the presence in the lungs of pleural plaques , will suffice to create a cause of action in tort for damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	441	And there is a third issue relating only to Mr Grieves , namely , whether , if the answers to the first and second issues are in the negative , he has a tortious cause of action for the psychiatric injury produced by his worry about the possibility that he may contract an asbestos related disease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	442	65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	443	In considering these issues a number of well established principles of law , not in dispute before your Lordships nor I believe at any stage in this litigation , need to be kept firmly in mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	444	First , a cause of action in tort for recovery of damages for negligence is not complete unless and until damage has been suffered by the claimant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	445	Some damage , some harm , some injury must have been caused by the negligence in order to complete the claimant 's cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	446	In Page v Smith -LSB- 1996 -RSB- 1 AC 155 , a case about a psychiatric illness caused by a motorcar accident and of which more must be said later , Lord Lloyd of Berwick said at p 190 that It was not in dispute in Page v Smith that to sustain a damages claim for personal injury caused by a negligent breach of a tortious duty of care some such `` disease or impairment ... '' was necessary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	447	In Cartledge v E Jopling & Sons Ltd -LSB- 1963 -RSB- AC 758 this House held that a physical condition caused by a negligent act or omission had to reach a certain threshold `` beyond the minimal '' in order for it to constitute an injury for which damages in tort could be claimed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	448	Lord Evershed at 773/4 said that : And Lord Pearce at 779 said that As I have said , these principles are not in dispute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	449	66 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	450	Second , it is accepted that a state of anxiety produced by some negligent act or omission but falling short of a clinically recognisable psychiatric illness does not constitute damage sufficient to complete a tortious cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	451	This has been the law for a long time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	452	Lord Wensleydale in Lynch v Knight -LRB- 1861 -RRB- 9 HLC 577 , 598 said that He went on , however , to comment that So , anxiety simpliciter can not constitute the damage necessary to complete the tortious cause of action ; but if there is some such damage the fact of the anxiety can enhance the amount of damages recoverable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	453	67 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	454	Third , it is accepted that a risk , produced by a negligent act or omission , of an adverse condition arising at some time in the future does not constitute damage sufficient to complete a tortious cause of action -LRB- see Gregg v Scott -LSB- 2005 -RSB- 2 AC 176 and Law Society v Sephton & Co -LSB- 2006 -RSB- 2 AC 543 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	455	The victim of the negligence must await events . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	456	Here , too , however , it is common ground that if some physical injury has been caused by the negligence , so that a tortious cause of action has accrued to the victim , the victim can recover damages not simply for his injury in its present state but also for the risk that the injury may worsen in the future and for his present and ongoing anxiety that that may happen . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	457	Are pleural plaques an `` injury '' for the purposes of the tort of negligence ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	458	68 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	459	Holland J held that they were not : -LSB- 2005 -RSB- EWHC 88 -LRB- QB -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	460	He held , first , in para .71 , that and , secondly , in para 80a that pleural plaques per se could not found a cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	461	He said The judge 's conclusion , concurred in by all the members of the Court of Appeal , that pleural plaques could not be characterised as a disease or as an impairment of physical condition was in part a finding of fact but also a conclusion of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	462	The question whether the formation of pleural plaques suffices to complete a tortious cause of action in negligence depends on what the law recognises as damage , not on how medical experts may classify the condition in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	463	The facts , however , lead inevitably in my opinion to the conclusion reached by the judge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	464	Pleural plaques are not visible or disfiguring . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	465	None of the appellants suffered from any disability or impairment of physical condition caused by the pleural plaques . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	466	The plaques were asymptomatic and were not the first stage of any asbestos related disease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	467	The inhalation of the fibres and the formation of the plaques involved no pain or physical discomfort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	468	Those being the facts the conclusion that the presence of pleural plaques could not per se suffice to complete a tortious cause of action in negligence is , in my opinion , unassailable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	469	Indeed both before Holland J and in the Court of Appeal the appellants conceded that that was so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	470	They based their case on the so-called `` aggregation '' theory , namely , that the presence of pleural plaques plus the attendant anxiety and the risk of contracting a life threatening asbestos related disease in the future together constituted sufficient damage to complete the tortious cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	471	The aggregation theory 69 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	472	Holland J accepted the aggregation theory -LRB- para .80 -LRB- c -RRB- of his judgment -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	473	His reasoning had , I think , two limbs to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	474	First , he regarded the pleural plaques , although not sufficient per se to complete the tortious cause of action , as constituting nonetheless `` physiological damage '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	475	Secondly , he held that 70 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	476	In the Court of Appeal the majority , in the judgment delivered by Lord Phillips , pointed out the problem with Holland J 's reasoning , namely , that the pleural plaques , the physiological damage , had `` no potential causal nexus with the asbestos-related diseases that the claimants -LSB- might -RSB- develop in the future '' -LRB- -LSB- 2006 -RSB- ICR 1458 , para 35 -RRB- and that it was the penetration of the chest by asbestos fibres , not the pleural plaques , that would have a causal nexus with the onset of any such disease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	477	In paragraph 36 Lord Phillips posed the following highly pertinent question He held that the door should not be opened -LRB- para 68 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	478	71 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	479	Smith LJ 's dissenting opinion was based on her view that the pleural plaques did constitute an injury - because in rare cases , although in none of the cases of these appellants , pleural plaques could give rise to symptoms -LRB- para .116 -RRB- and because they were comparable to a lesion on the skin caused by a cut or a burn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	480	She said that she could not accept that a visible tissue change was different in nature from a tissue change hidden within the body . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	481	I think , with respect , that the comparison the Lady Justice was drawing was not a helpful one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	482	A scar or lesion on the skin may constitute a tortiously relevant injury because it is disfiguring . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	483	A lesion hidden within the body is plainly not of that character . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	484	A cut or a burn , provided it is not so trivial as to fall in the de minimis category , is a tortiously relevant injury regardless of the scar it may leave . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	485	A cut or a burn hurts when inflicted and often hurts in the process of healing ; but there is no point at which the formation of a pleural plaque causes any discomfort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	486	The individual who has been exposed to asbestos dust will not know that the formation of plaques is taking or has taken place unless he or she undergoes an X-ray or other medical scan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	487	72 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	488	The learned Lady Justice , having formed the view that the formation of the plaques sufficed to complete the claimants ' respective causes of action , did not need to consider the aggregation theory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	489	She did , however , in para .134 , say that 73 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	490	My Lords in my view the aggregation theory can not be accepted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	491	Once it is accepted that neither the presence of pleural plaques nor the risk of future asbestos-related disease nor anxiety about the onset in the future of a life-threatening disease can by itself constitute damage so as to complete the cause of action in tort , there seems to me that neither logic nor principle can support the proposition that the three combined could do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	492	None of the three is ruled out on a de minimis basis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	493	Asymptomatic pleural plaques do not constitute damage ; nor does risk of damage in the future ; nor does anxiety about the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	494	Contrast a mere scratch on the skin which can , conceptually , qualify but may be too trivial to constitute physical damage sufficient to complete a cause of action in tort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	495	A hundred such scratches would be likely to suffice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	496	Ten might do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	497	It would be a question of degree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	498	The mere simple scratch would fail to suffice not because it was not , conceptually speaking , a physical injury but because it was too trivial to attract the attention of the law of tort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	499	The law of tort is not concerned with trivia ; nor should it be . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	500	The aggregation theory put forward in these appeals fails , in my opinion , not because the three elements , plaques , risk and anxiety , are in aggregation too trivial , but because none can sustain a tort action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	501	Nought plus nought plus nought equals nought . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott

223	505	It can not be so based because the gist of the tort of negligence is damage and none of these things , individually or collectively , constitutes the requisite damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	506	But the conclusion that none of the appellants -LRB- leaving out of account for the moment Mr Grieves ' damages claim based on his psychiatric illness -RRB- has a cause of action against his negligent employer strikes , for me at least , a somewhat discordant note . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	507	Each of the appellants was employed under a contract of service . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	508	Each of the employers must surely have owed its employees a contractual duty of care , as well as and commensurate with the tortious duty on which the appellants based their claims . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	509	It is accepted that the tortious duty was broken by the exposure of the appellants to asbestos dust . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	510	I would have thought that it would follow that the employers were in breach also of their contractual duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	511	Damage is the gist of a negligence action in tort but damage does not have to be shown in order to establish a cause of action for breach of contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	512	All that is necessary is to prove the breach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	513	The amount of damages recoverable , once the breach of contract has been proved , is subject to well known rules established by the leading cases and , applying these rules , it might be well arguable that the breach of a contractual duty to provide a safe working environment for employees , an environment where reasonable precautions had been taken to avoid their exposure to injurious asbestos dust , would justify an award of contractual damages to compensate the employees for subjecting them to the risk of contracting in the future a life-threatening asbestos related disease .

223	516	Mr Burton QC made expressly clear in the course of the hearing of this appeal that the appellants ' claims were based on tort and not on breach of contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott

223	518	I would , however , observe that sections 11 and 14 of the Limitation Act 1980 , which apply to negligence actions for damages for personal injuries , not only apply to actions based on breach of a tortious duty of care but can surely apply also to actions based on breach of a contractual duty of care .

223	519	Mr Grieves ' damages claim based on his psychiatric illness 75 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	520	In my opinion , Mr Grieves ' claim fails for the forseeability reasons explained by Lord Phillips in the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	521	As Lord Phillips pointed out -LRB- para 76 -RRB- , Holland J had made no finding that Mr Grieves ' psychiatric injury was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of his employers ' breach of duty and -LRB- para 94 -RRB- no evidence had been adduced to enable such a finding to have been made .

223	523	Mr Burton relied heavily on Page v Smith -LSB- 1996 -RSB- 1 AC 155 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	524	That was a case in which a collision between two motorcars , brought about by negligent driving , had not caused physical injury to either driver but had caused one of them to suffer a recurrence of a psychiatric condition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	525	The Court of Appeal had held that the defendant was not liable because it had not been reasonable foreseeable that the accident would cause psychiatric injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	526	The House of Lords , by a majority , allowed the appeal on the ground , per Lord Lloyd of Berwick at 187 , that : 77 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	527	Mr Kent QC invited your Lordships to depart from Page v Smith and to hold that the recovery of damages in negligence for psychiatric injury depended upon the forseeability of psychiatric injury as a consequence of the negligence but submitted , in the alternative , that Page v Smith was distinguishable from Mr Grieves ' case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	528	It was distinguishable , he submitted , because the psychiatric illness had directly resulted from the motorcar collision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	529	There had been no intervening causative event . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	530	By contrast , in Mr Grieves ' case , his psychiatric illness had not been directly caused by his exposure to asbestos dust but had resulted from his worry about his liability to future illness and his reaction to the X-rays and medical reports which had disclosed the presence of pleural plaques in his lungs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	531	I am in agreement with Mr Kent that Page v Smith is distinguishable on that basis and that a test of forseeability of psychiatric illness as a result of exposure to asbestos dust must be passed if Mr Grieves ' damages action is to succeed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	532	For the reasons given by Lord Phillips that test can not , in my opinion , be passed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott

223	538	The claimants in these appeals were all exposed to asbestos dust while working for the relevant defendants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	539	The defendants all admit that they were at fault in exposing them to the dust . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	540	As a result of the exposure , asbestos fibres entered the claimants ' lungs and some of them worked their way through to the pleura . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	541	There they gave rise to plaques which were detected by x-rays and CT scans . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	542	It is common ground that the plaques are not symptomatic : they do not cause the claimants pain nor do they disable them in any way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	543	But they do indicate that the quantity of fibres in the claimants ' lungs is significant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	544	According to the evidence , the risk that they may develop asbestosis or mesothelioma is significantly higher in men with plaques than in men who have been exposed to asbestos dust in the workplace but who have not developed plaques . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	545	For that reason , during the hearing before the House , the plaques were said to function as a marker or litmus test for this increased risk . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott

223	547	For about twenty years pleural plaques have been regarded as actionable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	548	Courts have awarded damages for them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	549	Employers and their insurers have settled many claims for damages for them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	550	Even though this has not resulted in an unmanageable flood of claims , in the present cases the defendants and their insurers have taken a stand . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	551	They wish to close the gates by establishing that asymptomatic plaques are not actionable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	552	They failed before Holland J , but succeeded in the Court of Appeal : -LSB- 2006 -RSB- ICR 1458 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott

223	554	80 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	555	It is important to emphasise that the injuries for which the claimants , apart from Mr Grieves , seek damages are the pleural plaques , associated risks of developing diseases and associated anxiety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	556	For instance , in Mr Downey 's case the particulars of injuries state : In his submissions before the House Mr Burton QC put the claim in two ways : as a claim for the pleural plaques simpliciter , and as a claim for the pleural plaques with the associated risks and anxiety .

223	557	81 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	558	Mr Grieves gives as his details of injury : Even though Mr Grieves refers only to his anxiety about the risks of malignancy , in fact , he became clinically depressed and developed irritable bowel syndrome after being told that he had pleural plaques . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott

223	565	So far as the law of tort is concerned , it is trite that `` the ground of any action based on negligence is the concurrence of breach of duty and damage '' and that `` a cause of action accrues as soon as a wrongful act has caused personal injury beyond what can be regarded as negligible '' : Watson v Fram Reinforced Concrete Co -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Ltd and Winget Ltd 1960 SC -LRB- HL -RRB- 92 , 109 per Lord Reid , and Cartledge v E Jopling & Sons Ltd -LSB- 1963 -RSB- AC 758 , 771-772 per Lord Reid , respectively .

223	568	The asbestos fibres can not be removed from the claimants ' lungs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	569	In theory , the law might have held that the claimants had suffered personal injury when there were sufficient irremovable fibres in their lungs to cause the heightened risk of asbestosis or mesothelioma . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	570	But the courts have not taken that line . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott

223	572	In Cartledge v E Jopling & Sons Ltd -LSB- 1963 -RSB- AC 758 , 779 , Lord Pearce , with whom the other members of the House agreed , saw the relevant question as being `` whether a man has suffered material damage by any physical changes in his body . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	573	The physical changes that Lord Pearce had in mind were those associated with the actual onset of pneumoconiosis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	574	Indeed the whole question in the case revolved around the plaintiffs having that disease before they could know of it , not around the noxious dust having accumulated in their lungs during their employment between 1939 and 1950 .

223	575	86 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	576	The point was focused in Brown v North British Steel Foundry Ltd 1968 SC 51 when the pursuer tried an argument that had not been run in Cartledge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	577	The Law Reform -LRB- Limitation of Actions etc -RRB- Act 1954 was passed on 4 June 1954 but was not to affect any action or proceeding if the cause of action arose before that date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	578	The Lord Ordinary found that the pursuer did not begin to suffer from pneumoconiosis until 1955 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	579	But the pursuer contended that the injury had been done to his lungs by 1949 because he had been inhaling dangerous dust for some years before that and , as subsequent events showed , he was susceptible to pneumoconiosis in 1949 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	580	So the cause of action had arisen at that date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	581	The First Division of the Court of Session rejected that argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	582	Lord President Clyde held that there was no cause of action in 1949 and added , at pp 64-65 : As Lord Guthrie pointed out , at p 68 , the problem considered by this House in Cartledge v E Jopling & Sons Ltd could not have arisen if the pursuer 's contention had been sound . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	583	87 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	584	In summary , three elements must combine before there is a cause of action for damages for personal injuries caused by a defendant 's negligence or breach of statutory duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	585	There must be -LRB- 1 -RRB- a negligent act or breach of statutory duty by the defendant , which -LRB- 2 -RRB- causes an injury to the claimant 's body and -LRB- 3 -RRB- the claimant must suffer material damage as a result . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	586	88 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	587	In these cases the claimants do not suggest that the presence of the asbestos fibres in their lungs constitutes an injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	588	Rather , they argue that the plaques constitute an injury - the plaques are `` a physical change '' in their bodies , as envisaged by Lord Pearce in Cartledge -LSB- 1963 -RSB- AC 758 , 779 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	589	Taken by themselves , however , the plaques are benign and asymptomatic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	590	So , even assuming that the plaques could constitute a relevant ` injury ' to the claimants ' bodies , they do not cause them any material damage and so do not give rise to a cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	591	There is a small risk that , if the number of plaques increases , they may then cause the claimants some discomfort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	592	But the mere existence of that risk does not give rise to a present claim for damages : Gregg v Scott -LSB- 2005 -RSB- 2 AC 176 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	593	`` The mere possibility of damnum will not found a claim to reparation '' : Brown v North British Steel Foundry Ltd 1968 SC 51 , 68 per Lord Guthrie . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	594	If the risk were to eventuate , then at that stage the claimant concerned would have a claim for damages for the effects of the condition that he developed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	595	89 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	596	Under reference to Gregg v Scott , counsel for the claimants accepted that , by itself , the present risk that they might eventually develop asbestosis or mesothelioma does not give rise to a claim for damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	597	He also accepted , on the authority of Hicks v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire -LSB- 1992 -RSB- 2 All ER 65 , 69d-f , that even extreme anxiety amounting to fear of impending death is not itself actionable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	598	By itself , therefore , the anxiety felt by the claimants about the risks of developing a serious disease in the future is not actionable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	599	But he argued that , if you aggregated the three elements of the non-actionable pleural plaques , the non-actionable risk of developing diseases and the non-actionable anxiety , you produced an actionable claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	600	The logical difficulties of such an approach are self-evident and , in my view , insurmountable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	601	90 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	602	Of course , if the plaques were an actionable injury , the risk that they might eventually result in a harmful condition would be an element in any claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	603	So , too , would the related anxiety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	604	But the starting point for the claimants ' alternative argument is that the plaques are not an actionable injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	605	In other words , the law treats them as a condition that is not serious enough to require its intervention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	606	Very understandably , the claimants may be anxious about the plaques , just as they may be anxious about all sorts of other problems and potential problems in their lives . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	607	Such anxiety is a normal human emotion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	608	But , if the plaques themselves are not a condition for which the law will intervene to give damages , it would make no sense for it to give damages for anxiety associated with the plaques . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	609	91 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	610	There is a further , even more important , objection to the argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	611	The claimants ' anxiety is not actually about any risk to their health caused by the plaques themselves . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	612	Rather , they are worried that at some time in the future they may develop asbestosis or mesothelioma as a result of the accumulation of fibres in their lungs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	613	The plaques alert the claimants to a heightened risk of that happening , but they would not be a cause of the illness if it did develop . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	614	So , on the alternative approach , the claimants are seeking to make the plaques actionable by adding in a risk that they may develop a disease that would not be caused by the plaques but by the accumulation of fibres in their lungs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	615	Putting the point another way , a claimant with plaques would have a claim for damages for the risk that he would develop asbestosis or mesothelioma , when a claimant without plaques , but with exactly the same risk of developing those diseases , would have no claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	616	The plaques would be nothing more than a `` hook '' on which to hang a claim for damages for something which they did not cause . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	617	My noble and learned friend , Lord Hoffmann , rejected that approach in Gregg v Scott -LSB- 2005 -RSB- 2 AC 176 , 288-289 , paras 86-90 , and , for the reasons he gave , I would reject it in this case too . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	618	92 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	619	I would accordingly dismiss the appeals by the claimants other than Mr Grieves . 	lord rodger	self	outcome	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	620	I now turn to his appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	621	93 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	622	Like the other claimants , Mr Grieves puts his case in two ways . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	623	The first , based simply on the presence of the plaques , must fail for the reasons that the other claimants ' cases must fail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	624	Similarly , the mere risk that his plaques may become symptomatic or that he may develop asbestosis or mesothelioma in future does not give rise to a claim for damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	625	He says , however , that he can claim damages for the depression and associated irritable bowel syndrome that he developed as a result of being told about the plaques on his pleura . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	626	94 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	627	Again , two possible approaches were mooted in submissions before the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	628	The first was to treat his claim as one for psychological harm suffered by a claimant who was at risk of suffering physical injury in the form of asbestosis or mesothelioma . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	629	Mr Grieves would be a primary victim of the defendant 's wrongdoing and would be entitled to recover damages for his psychiatric injury , even if it had not been foreseeable : Page v Smith -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 155 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	630	Alternatively , Mr Grieves would have a free-standing claim for the reasonably foreseeable psychological harm that he suffered as a result of learning about the pleural plaques . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	631	95 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	632	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	633	in Page v Smith the plaintiff suffered psychiatric harm as a result of being exposed to , but escaping , instant physical harm . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	634	In other words , he developed his illness as an immediate response to a past event . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	635	Here , by contrast , Mr Grieves developed his illness on learning of a risk that he might possibly develop asbestosis or mesothelioma at some uncertain date in the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	636	In Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease Litigation Group B Plaintiffs v Medical Research Council -LSB- 2000 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep Med 161 the plaintiffs had taken part in a clinical trial organised by the defendants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	637	It included an injection carrying the risk of infecting them with a potentially lethal dose of the CJD agent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	638	It was reasonably foreseeable , and the defendants foresaw , that , over a long period , the patients would suffer psychiatric injury as a result of learning of the risk that they would develop CJD . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	639	Morland J held that the defendants owed the plaintiffs a duty of care . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	640	Nevertheless , he rejected their argument that they were in the same position as the victim in Page v Smith . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	641	Their illness was not caused by the immediate effects of a past traumatic event : it was triggered by their awareness of the risk that they would develop CJD and the nature of that condition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	642	In my view that was a valid distinction , which applies in the case of Mr Grieves also . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	643	Allowing his claim would constitute an expansion of the rule in Page v Smith , contrary to the ` thus far and no further ' guidance of Lord Steyn in Frost v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 455 , 500A-E . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	644	96 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	645	Mr Kent drew attention to a further , associated , point of distinction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	646	In Page v Smith the mechanism -LRB- the crash -RRB- which caused the onset of the plaintiff 's psychiatric harm was the same mechanism as had been liable to result in physical harm to him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	647	Here , by contrast , the mechanisms are different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	648	The risk that Mr Grieves would develop asbestosis or mesothelioma was caused by the defendant 's wrongdoing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	649	On the other hand , his depression is due to his doctor intervening to tell him about the plaques and to the events following on that , including , possibly , some misinformation provided to him by other people . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	650	The distinction confirms that an award of damages for Mr Grieves ' illness would go further than the award for the plaintiff 's illness in Page v Smith . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	651	97 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	652	Mr Allan QC submitted , however , that this distinction could not stand in the light of the application of Page v Smith in Simmons v British Steel plc -LSB- 2004 -RSB- ICR 585 where the pursuer 's mental illness was a consequence , not of the injuries which he suffered in the accident , but of his anger at the defenders ' negligence in allowing the accident to happen . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	653	But in Simmons , as in Page v Smith , the illness was prompted by the pursuer 's reaction to a very unpleasant event that had actually occurred , not by his contemplation of the risk that something unpleasant might occur in the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	654	Moreover , his claim was for a psychiatric illness brought on by an accident in which he had suffered a far from trivial physical injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	655	In my view Simmons is not authority for the application of Page v Smith in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	656	98 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	657	For these reasons I would reject the first basis on which Mr Grieves ' claim for psychiatric injury is put . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	658	99 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	659	Mr Allan argued that , leaving aside Page v Smith , the defendant owed Mr Grieves a duty of care not to cause him foreseeable psychiatric harm . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	660	I have no doubt that the defendants owed him a duty of care not to cause him psychiatric harm as a result of developing asbestosis or mesothelioma . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	661	In practice , a claim for such harm would simply be an element in his overall claim for damages for the illness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	662	But what he asserts is the very different duty to take reasonable care not to cause him psychiatric harm as a result of learning of the risk that he would develop these illnesses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	663	Again , in my view , it would be anomalous to recognise such a duty when the law considers that the risk itself is not actionable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	664	That can only be because the law proceeds on the view that ordinarily people in such a position can be expected to handle that information , very unpleasant though it is , without suffering any morbid effects . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	665	Moreover , as already pointed out , the mechanism which caused Mr Grieves ' illness was not the defendants ' act in exposing him to the asbestos dust , but the doctors ' telling him of the heightened risk that he would develop asbestosis or mesothelioma in the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	666	100 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	667	Mr Allan sought to rely on the Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	668	There , however , Morland J held that it was foreseeable that the victims would hear about their plight , not only from doctors and counsellors , but from angry , ill-informed , relatives and from sensational media reports which would tend to highlight or sensationalise the risk of the potential terrible outcome . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	669	On this basis he held that the psychiatric injury was foreseeable and that the defendants had foreseen it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	670	They were accordingly under a duty of care to avoid it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	671	None of those special circumstances was present in Mr Grieves ' case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	672	Indeed , Dr Menon considered that his case was ` relatively unique ' because he had long-standing anticipatory fears of developing the disease , which had been present since he had learned about the dangers of exposure some decades before . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	673	On the evidence there were no particular circumstances which would have alerted the defendants to the possibility that Mr Grieves would react any differently , in this way , from other men who were told of the risks and who could be expected to deal with them without suffering any psychiatric injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	674	In these circumstances I am satisfied that his illness was unforeseeable and that he has no claim for damages in respect of the depression and associated irritable bowel syndrome from which he suffers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	675	101 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	676	For these reasons , as well as those given by my noble and learned friends , Lord Hoffmann , Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Scott of Foscote , I would also dismiss Mr Grieves ' appeal . 	lord rodger	lord hoffmann	fullagr	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott

223	686	On the application of Page v Smith -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 155 in the appeal by Mr Grieves , assuming that case to have been correctly decided , I agree that it can and should be distinguished on its facts for reasons given by all of your Lordships . 	lord mance	all	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	687	As interpreted by the majority of the House in Frost v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 455 , it concerned psychiatric injury arising as an immediate consequence of an obvious accident , in which the claimant could foreseeably have been physically injured at the time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	688	However , like my noble and learned friend , Lord Hope , I would leave open the correctness of Page v Smith for another day . 	lord mance	lord hope	partagr	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	689	I see some force in the criticisms that have been levied against it , and I am not confident that it does not cause uncertainty and argument -LRB- the latter indeed in this case -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	690	On the one hand psychiatric illness resulting over time from the exacerbation of a physical condition contributed to by anger about the occurrence of a past accident -LRB- in which the claimant did , it is true , suffer a physical injury -RRB- was held recoverable irrespective of foreseeability in Simmons v British Steel plc -LSB- 2004 -RSB- ICR 585 , in reliance on Page v Smith . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	691	On the other hand , the present case establishes that psychiatric illness arising from the stress of belated discovery of a continuing risk of future physical illness arising from past exposure to asbestos dust is not actionable , in the absence of specific foreseeability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	692	Some artificiality may be a necessary result of the controls on which the law insists in this area . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	693	But this distinction , although one that I endorse if necessary , is not , I think , particularly happy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
223	694	However , it is unnecessary to say more about it in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann, lord hope, lord rodger, lord scott
