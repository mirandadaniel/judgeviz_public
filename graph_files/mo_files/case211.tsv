211	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
211	4	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
211	5	On 17 May 2003 the appellant , Mr Whalley , who is an adult , assaulted and injured the respondent , Mr Jones , at Newton-le-Willows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
211	6	The matter was reported to the Greater Manchester Police , and an officer of that force interviewed Mr Whalley concerning an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
211	7	Mr Whalley admitted commission of that offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
211	8	The officer decided that Mr Whalley should not be prosecuted but should instead be cautioned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
211	9	He was notified of this decision in a standard form bearing the imprint of the Greater Manchester Police . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
211	10	This form explained the effect of the caution : In a section directed to adults , the form stated : The form repeated that if Mr Whalley appeared before a Court and was found guilty of another offence then details of this caution might be given to the Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
211	11	It is not found as a fact , but it seems safe to infer , that the effect of the form was explained orally to Mr Whalley by the officer , and that Mr Whalley agreed to be cautioned on these terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
211	12	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
211	13	On 22 December 2003 Mr Jones , acting as a private prosecutor , laid an information against Mr Whalley , charging him with assault occasioning actually bodily harm contrary to section 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
211	14	The matter came before Justices sitting at St Helens , and Mr Whalley submitted that his acceptance of a police caution on the indication that , if he accepted it , he would not face any further criminal proceedings , should preclude a private prosecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
211	15	The Justices heard argument on this issue on 25 October 2004 , when authority was cited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	16	The Justices were satisfied that to allow the prosecution to proceed would be an abuse of the process of the magistrates ' court , and stayed the proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	17	On Mr Jones ' appeal to the Queen 's Bench Divisional Court by case stated , the court -LRB- Sedley LJ and Beatson J -RRB- held that the administration and acceptance of a caution were not sufficient to render the exercise of the right of private prosecution an abuse of process : -LSB- 2005 -RSB- EWHC 931 -LRB- Admin -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	18	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	19	Mr Whalley now challenges the conclusion of the Divisional Court , contending that the Justices were right , on the facts of this case , to reach the conclusion they did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	20	But he also raises a broader question , not deployed in argument below , whether the right of private prosecution can , or should , survive the implementation of a formal cautioning procedure which has not been quashed and set aside on an application for judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	21	Cautions 4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	22	In R -LRB- R -RRB- v Durham Constabulary -LSB- 2005 -RSB- UKHL 21 , -LSB- 2005 -RSB- 1 WLR 1184 , the House had occasion to consider the practice of formal reprimands and warnings established by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 to replace the practice of cautioning young offenders committing less serious offences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	23	The practice had become discredited , first , because cautions had in some areas been given so repeatedly and predictably that they lacked the desirable effect of deterring young offenders , and , secondly , because they did nothing constructively to address the roots of offending behaviour . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	24	Under the new regime , young offenders were no longer to be cautioned , but the new reprimands and warnings were intended to have teeth , and those warned were to be referred to youth offending teams . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	25	By section 65 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1998 Act , a constable may reprimand or warn a young offender only if he has evidence of the commission of an offence such as to give a realistic prospect of conviction ; if the offender admits the offence ; if the offender has not previously been convicted of an offence ; and if the constable is satisfied that it would not be in the public interest for the offender to be prosecuted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	26	In the Home Office/Youth Justice Board Guidance for the Police and Youth Offending Teams on the Final Warning Scheme -LRB- November 2002 -RRB- it is made clear -LRB- paras 1.2 - 1.3 -RRB- that the object of the new scheme is to prevent offending by young people and divert them from their offending behaviour before they enter the court system . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	27	Prominence is given to the requirement that prosecution must be judged to be not in the public interest -LRB- paras 4.7 -LRB- e -RRB- , 4.26 -RRB- , and by section 56 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 was amended to grant power to bail a young offender pending possible reprimand or warning , thus enabling the public interest to be more fully considered and the views of victims ascertained -LRB- paras 4.28 , 6.15 , chapters 7 , 8 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	28	But the views of victims , although an important factor in determining the seriousness of an offence , are not conclusive , and victims should not be involved in decisions on disposals for young offenders , which are the responsibility of the police alone -LRB- para 8.11 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	29	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	30	Sections 22 and 23 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 introduced a new regime , applicable only to adult offenders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	31	It provided for the giving of cautions subject to conditions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	32	Non-compliance with the conditions exposes the offender to prosecution for the original offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	33	The conditions imposed -LRB- s. 22 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -RRB- must be directed to one or both of two objects , facilitating the rehabilitation of the offender and ensuring that he makes reparation for the offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	34	A conditional caution may only be given by an authorised person and where each of five requirements is satisfied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	35	An authorised person is defined -LRB- s. 22 -LRB- 4 -RRB- -RRB- to mean a constable , an investigating officer or a person authorised by a relevant prosecutor -LRB- defined in s. 27 -RRB- for purposes of section 22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	36	The first requirement is that the authorised person has evidence that the offender has committed the offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	37	The second is that a relevant prosecutor decides -LRB- a -RRB- that there is sufficient evidence to charge the offender with the offence , and -LRB- b -RRB- that a conditional caution should be given to the offender in respect of the offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	38	The third requirement is that the offender admit guilt to the authorised person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	39	The fourth requirement is that the authorised person explains the effect of the conditional caution , warning him that failure to comply with the conditions may result in prosecution for the offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	40	The last requirement is that the offender signs a document admitting the detailed offence and consenting to the caution on the specified conditions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	41	By section 24 , failure to comply with the conditions without reasonable excuse may lead to the institution of criminal proceedings against the offender for the offence in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	42	Pursuant to his duty under section 25 of the Act , the Secretary of State has issued a Code of Practice on Conditional Cautioning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	43	This points out -LRB- in para 2.2 -RRB- that `` The simple caution will remain available as a disposal , and may be appropriate in cases where no suitable conditions readily suggest themselves , or where prosecution would not be in the public interest '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	44	Provision is made for involving victims , but -LRB- para 7.1 -RRB- `` it is vital not to give the impression that the victim 's views -LRB- if any -RRB- will be conclusive as to the outcome , which -LRB- it should be explained -RRB- is at the discretion of the CPS '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
211	45	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	46	Neither the reprimand and warning regime established by the 1998 Act nor the conditional cautioning regime introduced by the 2003 Act applies to this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	47	Mr Whalley is an adult . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	48	His caution contained no conditions , and the 2003 Act was not in force when he was cautioned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	49	The procedure adopted when cautioning him was not governed by statute , but was the subject of a series of Home Office circulars , most recently Circular 18/1994 on the Cautioning of Offenders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	50	This set out revised National Standards for Cautioning Offenders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	51	In these the purposes of a formal caution were defined -LRB- para 1 -RRB- : to deal quickly and simply with less serious offenders ; to divert them from unnecessary appearance in the criminal courts ; and to reduce the chances of their re-offending . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	52	It is made clear -LRB- para 2 -RRB- that before a caution may be given there must be sufficient evidence , an admission of guilt and informed consent by the offender to the giving of a caution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	53	A note to para 2 provides : Para 3 provides that where the requirements are met , consideration should be given to whether a caution is in the public interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	54	The police should take into account the public interest principles described in the Code for Crown Prosecutors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	55	These provide that a potential defendant should not be prosecuted , despite the existence of evidence providing a realistic prospect of conviction , where it is judged that prosecution would not be in the public interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	56	The narrower issue 7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	57	On behalf of Mr Whalley , Mr Timothy King QC relied on his client 's agreement to be cautioned on an express assurance by the police officer that he would not have to go before a criminal court in connection with the matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	58	He relied by analogy on R v Croydon Justices , Ex p Dean -LSB- 1993 -RSB- QB 769 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	59	In that case the applicant assisted the police in a murder investigation on the understanding , induced by the police , that he would not himself be prosecuted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	60	Some weeks later , at the instance of the CPS , the applicant was charged with a lesser offence connected with the same crime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	61	In committal proceedings before justices it was submitted that the prosecution was an abuse of the process of the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	62	This contention was rejected by the justices , but accepted by the Divisional Court -LRB- Staughton LJ and Buckley J -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	63	Mr King pointed out that in that case the police had no authority to bind the CPS just as , in this , the police had no authority to bind Mr Jones . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	64	But the court did not regard that point as decisive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	65	At pp 776-777 Staughton LJ said , with the agreement of Buckley J : At p 778 he concluded : Here , Mr King argued , it was necessary to consider the effect on Mr Whalley of the categorical statement the officer made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	66	Mr King distinguished Hayter v L -LSB- 1998 -RSB- 1 WLR 854 , where two defendants who had been cautioned were thereafter privately prosecuted , and the prosecution was held by a Divisional Court -LRB- Schiemann LJ and Poole J -RRB- not to be an abuse . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	67	The point of distinction in that case was that the forms signed by the defendants indicated in terms that such cautions did not preclude the bringing of proceedings by an aggrieved party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	68	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	69	To this argument , Mr Malcolm Swift QC -LRB- who , like Mr King , did not appear below -RRB- advanced a series of answers on behalf of Mr Jones . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	70	First , he submitted , the right of private prosecution is expressly preserved by section 6 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	71	That section provides : This provision means exactly what it says . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	72	Save where the Director of Public Prosecutions is under a duty to take over the conduct of proceedings or , not being under a duty , chooses to do so , Part I of the Act , establishing the CPS , does not preclude the bringing of a private prosecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	73	To that extent the right of private prosecution survives . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
211	74	But Mr Whalley does not rely on any provision of Part I as defeating the private prosecution brought by Mr Jones . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	75	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	76	Secondly , Mr Swift relied on Lord Wilberforce 's recognition of the right to bring a private prosecution as `` a valuable constitutional safeguard against inertia or partiality on the part of authority '' in Gouriet v Union of Post Office Workers -LSB- 1978 -RSB- AC 435 , 477 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	77	In the same case -LRB- p 498 -RRB- Lord Diplock described private prosecutions as `` a useful constitutional safeguard against capricious , corrupt or biased failure or refusal of those authorities to prosecute offenders against the criminal law '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	78	Strong statements to the same effect have been made extra-judicially by , among others , Lord Simon of Glaisdale : see the Law Commission 's Report on Consents to Prosecution -LRB- LC 255 -RRB- of 20 October 1998 , para 4.4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	79	There are , however , respected commentators who are of opinion that with the establishment of an independent , professional prosecuting service , with consent required to prosecute in some more serious classes of case , with the prosecution of some cases reserved to the Director , and with power in the Director to take over and discontinue private prosecutions , the surviving right is one of little , or even no , value : op . cit. , paras 4.5-4 .8 , 5.7 , 5.10-5 .24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	80	The Law Commission concluded -LRB- para 5.24 -RRB- Mr Swift is entitled to insist that the right of private prosecution continues to exist in England and Wales , and may have a continuing role . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	81	But it is hard to regard it as an important constitutional safeguard when , as I understand , private prosecutions are all but unknown in Scotland . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	82	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	83	Thirdly , Mr Swift distinguished R v Croydon Justices , Ex p Dean -LSB- 1993 -RSB- QB 769 by pointing out that the two bodies involved in that case , the police and the CPS , were both arms of the executive , whereas , in the present case , one -LRB- the police -RRB- is an arm of the executive and the other is a private individual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	84	This is certainly a distinction , and I would agree that Dean is a stronger case , and concerned a young person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	85	But what the court relied on in the passage quoted in para 7 above was the effect of the representation on the applicant , and the state has an interest in the integrity of court proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	86	In the present case Mr Whalley was led to believe that if he agreed to be cautioned he would not be prosecuted for this offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	87	He was probably misled into believing , wrongly , that the caution was a criminal conviction , because that is what the form said , an error into which the Justices also were misled , as the Divisional Court pointed out -LRB- para 8 -RRB- -LRB- although the Divisional Court was wrong to suggest that a warning or reprimand given to a young offender under section 65 of the 1998 Act has the status of a conviction : the warning or reprimand may , like a caution , be cited in later proceedings but is not , again like a caution , a conviction -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	88	It is not known whether , in the present case , Mr Whalley was alive to the risk of a civil claim against him by Mr Jones , but he doubtless believed that his acceptance of a caution rendered him immune from the risk of prosecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	89	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	90	Mr Swift submitted , fourthly , that the forms considered in Hayter v L -LSB- 1998 -RSB- 1 WLR 854 stated the true legal position accurately and the form in the present case did not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	91	But Mr Jones was not to be deprived of his rights by a mis-statement in a police form . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	92	If the police chose to caution Mr Whalley and not to instigate a prosecution , that was their decision and could not deny to Mr Jones the exercise of a right he enjoyed at law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	93	This is in my opinion correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	94	But it does not answer the question whether the proceedings brought by Mr Jones were fairly to be regarded by the Justices , in the circumstances , as an abuse of the court 's process . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	95	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	96	Mr Swift relied , fifthly , on the safeguards which exist to prevent or curb misuse of the right of private prosecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	97	These safeguards , listed in Hayter at p 858 , include the power of justices to refuse to issue a summons and the Director 's power to take over private prosecutions and bring them to an end . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	98	The House should not , it was argued , invent any further safeguard . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	99	I would accept the value of these safeguards in some cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	100	Authority shows that the issue of a summons is a judicial act -LRB- R v West London Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate , Ex p Klahn -LSB- 1979 -RSB- 1 WLR 933 -RRB- , but in practice summonses are routinely issued without detailed scrutiny , and there is nothing to suggest that the police caution of Mr Whalley was disclosed when application was made for the summons in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	101	The CPS was , as the Justices record , offered the opportunity to take over Mr Jones ' prosecution , but declined to do so for reasons which are not in evidence : the CPS may have disagreed with the police action and favoured prosecution ; or it may have agreed with the police decision but preferred to leave the matter to the Justices . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	102	It is not clear that either of these safeguards operated effectively in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
211	103	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	104	The narrower issue is whether a private prosecution may or should be regarded as an abuse of the process of the magistrates ' court where the defendant has agreed to be formally cautioned by the police on the assurance that , if he agrees , he will not have to go before a criminal court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	105	The abuse complained of is not abuse impairing the fairness of the trial , since evidence of the admission and caution could be excluded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	106	The abuse complained of goes , as in R v Horseferry Road Magistrates ' Court , Ex p Bennett -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 42 , to the fairness of trying Mr Whalley at all in the circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	107	The Justices recognised , on the authority of that case , that the power to stay must be used sparingly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	108	But they thought it would be an abuse , and not only , as I infer , because they were misled into regarding the caution as a conviction , which , if true , would have given Mr Whalley a complete defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	109	I agree with the Justices ' conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	110	If Mr Jones had legal grounds for attacking the police decision to caution Mr Whalley , he could apply for judicial review to quash that decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	111	If successful , the slate would be clean . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	112	There would be no citable caution on Mr Whalley 's record and Mr Jones would be free to prosecute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	113	But so long as that formal caution stood , induced by a representation that he would not be prosecuted , the private prosecution of Mr Whalley did in my opinion amount to an abuse , as the Justices held . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	114	The broader issue 14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	115	In his oral submissions to the House Mr King questioned whether , irrespective of what may be said to , or stated in a form given to , a person who is cautioned , conditionally cautioned , reprimanded or warned , it can ever be other than an abuse of process for a court thereafter to entertain a private prosecution against him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	116	To the extent that this contention was inconsistent with Hayter , counsel challenged the correctness of that decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	117	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	118	The broad lines of the argument may be summarised in this way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	119	The practice of cautioning , originally developed by the police as a pragmatic response to a certain class of case , has grown into something much more sophisticated and specific , as evidenced by the statutory regimes established by the 1998 and 2003 Acts and a series of Home Office Circulars . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	120	While there are obvious differences between the young offender , conditional cautioning and simple cautioning regimes , they have shared objectives of seeking to keep people out of the criminal courts and preventing further offending . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	121	Underlying a decision to reprimand , warn , caution conditionally or caution simpliciter , and fundamental to each , is a judgment made by a responsible official that prosecution would not be in the public interest , or at least that the public interest would be better served by not prosecuting . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	122	Such a judgment , like a decision not to prosecute , is not immune from challenge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	123	If shown to be unlawful on any of the familiar grounds relied on to seek judicial review , it may be quashed and set aside . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	124	But so long as the decision stands the judgment should be respected , and it would be wrong in principle to allow it to be circumvented at the behest of a private prosecutor whose motives may have little or nothing to do with the public interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	125	The right to prosecute privately is a factor of little weight in the balance , since it is a somewhat anomalous historical survival ; it can not outweigh an extant decision of a responsible official on what will best serve the public interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	126	On this argument , paradoxically , the statement made in the form given to Mr Whalley , in its reference to going before a criminal court , was accurate , and the statement in the Hayter forms was inaccurate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	127	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	128	I see very considerable force in this argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	129	A crime is an offence against the good order of the state . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	130	It is for the state by its appropriate agencies to investigate alleged crimes and decide whether offenders should be prosecuted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	131	In times past , with no public prosecution service and ill-organised means of enforcing the law , the prosecution of offenders necessarily depended on the involvement of private individuals , but that is no longer so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	132	The surviving right of private prosecution is of questionable value , and can be exercised in a way damaging to the public interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
211	133	I would not , therefore , reject this argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
211	134	But nor do I think the House should in this appeal accept it , for reasons which I find , cumulatively , to be compelling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
211	135	It was not advanced in the Divisional Court , so we lack the benefit of its judgment on it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
211	136	It was scarcely foreshadowed in Mr Whalley 's written case , and there was no hint that the correctness of Hayter was to be challenged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
211	137	Thus Mr Swift had little opportunity to prepare an argument in reply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
211	138	The question is one of some importance , and should not be resolved in the absence of representation of the Crown or any police force , both of whom might be expected to have views on how the issue should be decided . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
211	139	The question is one which might well benefit from legislative attention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
211	140	It is not necessary to resolve this question to decide the present appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN

211	146	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
211	147	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
211	148	In May 2003 the appellant , Mr Whalley , assaulted and injured the respondent , Mr Jones . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
211	149	When interviewed by the Greater Manchester Police , he admitted the offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
211	150	The officer concerned decided that Mr Whalley should not be prosecuted , but should be cautioned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
211	151	In the case of the Greater Manchester Police the effects of a caution are set out on a standard form . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
211	152	It is not in dispute that Mr Whalley was informed of those effects and agreed to be cautioned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
211	153	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
211	154	Mr Whalley 's standard form told him that a decision had been made that he was to receive a caution for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm for which he had been interviewed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
211	155	The notice continued : The form went on to spell out the other consequences of the caution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
211	156	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
211	157	Having been told this , Mr Whalley would have been entitled to assume that , since he had accepted the caution with its attendant effects , he would not now be prosecuted for the assault on Mr Jones . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
211	158	The form warned him , however , that details of his caution would be disclosed to the victim in accordance with the victims ' charter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
211	159	And , presumably , having been made aware that there was to be no public prosecution , the victim , Mr Jones , initiated a private prosecution against him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
211	160	Some months later , the Chief Crown Prosecutor for Merseyside declined to take over the prosecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
211	161	The House knows nothing about the reasons for that decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
211	162	In October 2004 , the justices held that it would be an abuse of the process of the court to allow the prosecution to proceed and so they stayed the proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	163	Mr Jones appealed and the Divisional Court reversed the justices , holding that in the circumstances the prosecution was not an abuse of process . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	164	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	165	When the police officer cautioned Mr Whalley , he was not acting under a statutory scheme . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	166	But nor was he off on a frolic of his own , or on a frolic of the Greater Manchester Police . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	167	On the contrary , he was acting in accordance with an officially recognised policy which was intended to be followed by police forces throughout the country in accordance with guidance issued by the Home Office . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	168	The current guidance was to be found in Home Office Circular 18/1994 , to which was annexed a revised version of the National Standards for Cautioning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	169	Paragraph 1 of the Standards describes the purposes of a formal caution as being to deal quickly and simply with less serious offenders , `` to divert them from unnecessary appearance in the criminal courts , '' and to reduce the chances of their re-offending . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	170	All worthwhile policy objectives . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	171	Before the police can contemplate administering a caution , there must be sufficient evidence of the offender 's guilt and he must admit the offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	172	Provided these requirements are met , `` consideration should be given to whether a caution is in the public interest '' : para 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	173	The police are told that they should take into account the public interest principles described in the Code for Crown Prosecutors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	174	In their turn , Crown Prosecutors are told in para 8.3 of the current Code for Crown Prosecutors that a simple caution should only be given if the public interest justifies it and in accordance with Home Office guidelines . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	175	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	176	What is clear from the National Standards is that a police officer should not decide to administer a caution , rather than to prosecute , unless he is satisfied that cautioning rather than prosecution is in the public interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	177	Presumably , the officer in this case was so satisfied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	178	If that view was untenable , his decision to caution rather than to prosecute could be set aside on judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	179	But Mr Jones has not challenged the officer 's decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	180	The assumption must be that the police officer was entitled to decide that it was in the public interest for Mr Whalley to be given a caution and so avoid an `` unnecessary appearance in the criminal courts '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	181	On that basis the officer represented to Mr Whalley that he would not have to go before a criminal court for the offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	182	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	183	In these circumstances , where such an assurance had been given to Mr Whalley , any subsequent decision by the Crown Prosecutor to prosecute him would have been capable of being regarded as an abuse of process : R v Croydon Justices , Ex p Dean -LSB- 1993 -RSB- QB 769 , 778F-G per Staughton LJ . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	184	What happened in this case , however , was that Mr Jones , a private individual , unconnected with the police or prosecuting authorities , initiated the prosecution , despite the assurance given to Mr Whalley . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	185	Whether or not Mr Jones was consulted before the police officer took the decision to caution rather than to prosecute and to give that assurance , he was certainly not a party to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	186	So there is no question of Mr Jones being estopped from initiating the prosecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	187	Nor did he do anything to give Mr Whalley any legitimate expectation that he would not be prosecuted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	188	The question is , rather , whether the magistrates were entitled to stay the proceedings because it offended their sense of justice and propriety to be asked to try the accused in these circumstances : R v Horseferry Road Magistrates ' Court , Ex p Bennett -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 42 , 74G-H per Lord Lowry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	189	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	190	Nowadays public prosecutions are the rule . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	191	So , usually , the court will be concerned to prevent its process being misused by a public prosecutor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
211	192	But , in times gone by , when private prosecutions were the rule , the court must have had the power to guard against the corresponding danger of its process being misused by a private prosecutor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	193	So , in this case the justices had the same power to stay for abuse of process as they would have had in the case of a public prosecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	194	Having duly considered the matter , the justices came to the view that it would be an abuse of their process to allow Mr Jones to continue with the prosecution of Mr Whalley , after the police had given him an assurance that he would not have to go to court in respect of the offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	195	Clearly , they considered that it offended their sense of justice and propriety to be asked to try the accused in the face of that assurance , irrespective of the fact that the prosecution was initiated by a private individual rather than by a public official . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	196	Not only was that a view which was open to the justices , but it is one which I share . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	197	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	198	Looking at the matter from a slightly different angle , it seems to me that allowing private prosecutions to proceed , despite an assurance that the offender would not have to go to court , would tend to undermine not only the non-statutory system of cautions , but also the schemes for cautioning young offenders and adult offenders which Parliament has endorsed in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and the Criminal Justice Act 2003 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	199	A court is entitled to ensure that its process is not misused in this way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	200	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	201	In the course of the hearing , the House was referred to the decision of the Divisional Court in Hayter v L -LSB- 1998 -RSB- 1 WLR 854 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	202	In that case the defendants had assaulted and injured a young man . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	203	The police cautioned them , but the terms of the caution indicated that it did not preclude the bringing of proceedings by an aggrieved party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	204	The victim 's father then initiated a prosecution of the defendants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	205	They contended that the proceedings should be stayed as an abuse of process . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	206	The justices dismissed the informations , but the Divisional Court allowed the prosecutor 's appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	207	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	208	The qualification in a caution of that type means that the decision in Hayter is distinguishable from the present case and , for that reason , the House did not hear full submissions on it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	209	I accordingly agree with my noble and learned friend , Lord Bingham of Cornhill , that it would not be appropriate to express a concluded view about the broader argument relating to it . 	lord rodger	lord bingham	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	210	Accordingly , I make only one tentative observation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	211	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	212	Plainly , the Hayter type of qualification to the caution would alert the offender to the lingering possibility of a private prosecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	213	So the reaction of a court to being asked to try the case in such circumstances might well be different from its reaction in a case where the caution was not qualified in that way - although , in Hayter 's case , the qualification does not actually seem to have weighed with the justices . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	214	The point which concerns me , however , is not the effect of such a qualified caution on the court 's sense of propriety and justice , but , rather , whether it is proper for a police officer to insert the qualification in the caution and , if so , in what circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	215	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	216	The National Standards indicate that a police officer should not administer a caution unless he concludes that it is in the public interest to divert the offender from an unnecessary appearance in the criminal courts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	217	Prima facie , this would seem to suggest that the officer should have concluded that it is unnecessary for the offender to appear in the criminal courts , whether at the instance of a public or a private prosecutor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	218	Some support for that view might perhaps be found in para 7 of the Home Office circular which contemplates the police giving the victim details of the offender in order to institute civil , but not criminal , proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	219	On that assumption , however , it would be difficult to see how the officer could administer a caution but simultaneously contemplate - by including the Hayter qualification - that it could be in the public interest for the offender to be prosecuted by the victim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	220	The inclusion of the qualification suggests , however , that the officer has concluded that , while it would not be in the public interest for a public prosecution to be mounted , it would none the less be legitimate , and not contrary to the public interest , for the victim to prosecute , if so advised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
211	221	Your Lordships heard no submissions on whether it is appropriate for a police officer to issue a caution , with the various consequences for the offender , on that basis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
211	222	Nor was counsel in a position to explain whether there is an established practice of issuing such qualified cautions in certain kinds of cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

211	247	Plainly , however , such a rule , were it to be established , would substantially diminish what many understand to be the present scope for private prosecutions and , as Lord Bingham observes , the question needs to be subject to altogether fuller argument than was addressed to the House on this occasion . 	lord brown	lord bingham	partagr	0.8	NAN

211	249	I too , therefore , would allow this appeal on the narrow ground that it is an abuse of process to prosecute someone who has accepted a formal caution on the express assurance that he `` will not have to go before a criminal court in connection with this matter .

211	250	The respondent submits that the victim can not properly be deprived of his right to bring a private prosecution by a police mis-statement -LRB- Mr Swift 's fourth argument set out by Lord Bingham at para 11 above -RRB- . 	lord brown	lord bingham	partagr	0.9	NAN

211	255	The difficulty , of course , in deciding the present appeal on the narrow ground is that , until the wider issue is resolved by further litigation or , preferably perhaps , by legislation , it remains unclear whether , when administering a caution , the police should warn the offenders , as in Hayter v L -LSB- 1998 -RSB- 1 WLR 854 , 855 , that the caution `` did not preclude an aggrieved party from bringing criminal proceedings or a civil action '' or , as here , should assure them of immunity from criminal process .

NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
211	282	But at paragraph 5.22 they recited three factors which , as they concluded in their consultation paper , demonstrated that these potential harms did not undermine the fundamental principle of the right to institute a private prosecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
211	283	The factors were : 42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
211	284	In the circumstances , the Commission made no suggestion that the right of private prosecution be abolished , but proposed a reformed regime for requiring consent of the Attorney General or Director of Public Prosecutions in the case of certain offences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
211	285	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
211	286	The right of private prosecution operates and has been explained at the highest level as a safeguard against wrongful refusal or failure by public prosecuting authorities to institute proceedings : see the statements by Lord Simon , Lord Diplock and Lord Wilberforce to which I have already referred and paragraph 5.3 of the Law Commission 's report . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
211	287	That justification is relevant not just where police fail to take any action at all , but also where their only response is to obtain a caution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
211	288	Further , as the Law Commission pointed out in their third factor -LRB- cf paragraph 5.22 -RRB- , it can not always be assumed that , if it is wrong to bring a public prosecution , then it is also wrong to bring a private prosecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
211	289	While it is a matter of speculation , it is not impossible that such a thought played its part in the decision of the Chief Crown Prosecutor for Merseyside in the present case , declining to take over the prosecution with a view to bringing it to an end . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
211	290	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
211	291	As matters stand , I do not consider that police , when cautioning an admitted offender , should give any unqualified assurance that the person being cautioned will not thereafter `` have to go before a criminal court in connection with this matter '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
211	292	Rather , I agree with Lord Brown that they should give a warning along the lines given in Hayter v L -LSB- 1998 -RSB- 1 WLR 854 , but that it would be preferable to give it in slightly modified terms , stating that the caution may not preclude a private prosecution -LRB- and will not preclude a civil action -RRB- by an aggrieved party . 	lord mance	lord brown	NAN	1	NAN
211	293	A court before which any such private prosecution is brought will retain a power to stay the proceedings in the event that it concludes that , despite the warning , it would be abusive for them to continue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
