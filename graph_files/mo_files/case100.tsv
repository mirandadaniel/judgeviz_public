100	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord browne-wilkinson
100	4	In this case the appellants , all of whom are unpromoted women teachers employed by the respondents , advance a claim to equal pay under the Equal Pay Act 1970 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord browne-wilkinson
100	5	Their claim is based on the fact that , although they do the same work as a `` principal teacher , '' they are paid at a lower rate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord browne-wilkinson
100	6	Each of the female applicants has selected a male comparator who is a principal teacher employed by the respondent and claims equality of pay with such comparator . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord browne-wilkinson
100	7	Section 1 of the Act of 1970 -LRB- as amended -RRB- provides , so far as relevant : `` 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- If the terms of a contract under which a woman is employed at an establishment in Great Britain do not include -LRB- directly or by reference to a collective agreement or otherwise -RRB- an equality clause they shall be deemed to include one . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord browne-wilkinson
100	8	-LRB- 2 -RRB- An equality clause is a provision which relates to terms -LRB- whether concerned with pay or not -RRB- of a contract under which a woman is employed -LRB- the ` woman 's contract ' -RRB- , and has the effect that - -LRB- a -RRB- where the woman is employed in like work with a man in the same employment - -LRB- i -RRB- if -LRB- apart from the equality clause -RRB- any term of the woman 's contract is or becomes less favourable to a woman than a term of a similar kind in the contract under which that man is employed , that term of the woman 's contract shall be treated as so modified as not to be less favourable , and -LRB- ii -RRB- if -LRB- apart from the equality clause -RRB- at any time the woman 's contract does not include a term corresponding to a term benefiting that man included in the contract under which he is employed , the woman 's contract should be treated as including such a term ; '' -- paragraph -LRB- b -RRB- deals with the case where the woman 's work is rated as equivalent and paragraph -LRB- c -RRB- deals with the case where the woman 's work is of equal value with that of the man - '' -LRB- 3 -RRB- An equality clause shall not operate in relation to a variation between the woman 's contract and the man 's contract if the employer proved that the variation is genuinely due to a material factor which is not the difference of sex and that factor -- -LRB- a -RRB- in the case of an equality clause falling within subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- or -LRB- b -RRB- above , must be a material difference between the woman 's case and the man 's ; '' The appellants claim that they were doing `` like work '' to that done by the male comparators and are therefore entitled to the benefit of an equality clause giving them equal pay with their comparators . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord browne-wilkinson
100	9	The respondents now concede that the appellants ' work is like work . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord browne-wilkinson
100	10	It follows that the appellants will be entitled to equal pay with principal teachers unless the respondents can establish a defence under subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- of section 1 , i.e. prove that the differences in pay are `` genuinely due to a material factor which is not the difference of sex . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord browne-wilkinson
100	11	The industrial tribunal and the Employment Appeal Tribunal held that the respondent employers had failed to establish a defence under subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord browne-wilkinson
100	12	The Second Division of the Court of Session -LRB- Lord Justice Clerk , Lord Weir and Lord Cowie -RRB- held , 1997 S.L.T. 315 that the respondents had established a subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord browne-wilkinson
100	13	The whole appeal therefore depends on the circumstances relied on by the respondents as giving rise to a subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord browne-wilkinson
100	14	I gratefully take the following account of the circumstances from the judgment of the Employment Appeal Tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord browne-wilkinson
100	15	The employers were originally the Strathclyde Regional Council as the education authority for the Strathclyde Region . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord browne-wilkinson
100	16	Since the decision of the case in the industrial tribunal the functions of the Regional Council have been distributed amongst other authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord browne-wilkinson
100	17	However , for convenience , I will refer to the relevant authorities for the time being as `` the respondents . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord browne-wilkinson
100	18	As education authority the respondents are under a statutory duty to secure the adequate and sufficient provision of school education in Strathclyde Region and to have regard , in doing so , not only to the statutory provisions governing education in Scotland but to directions which they receive from the Scottish Office Education Department , and to national agreements with unions such as those contained in circulars issued by the Scottish Joint Negotiating Committee -LRB- `` S.J.N.C. '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord browne-wilkinson
100	19	The structure of what are known as promoted posts in schools was laid down originally in the Schools -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Code 1956 , and revised by a Scottish Office Education Department circular in 1972 and S.E.D. Staffing Standard in 1987 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord browne-wilkinson
100	20	That structure permits the appointment of one head teacher in each school , with a number of lower grades of promoted posts , the number in each school depending upon a number of factors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord browne-wilkinson
100	21	The possible grades are deputy head teacher , assistant head teacher , principal teacher , assistant principal teacher , and senior teacher . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord browne-wilkinson
100	22	Equal pay for male and female teachers was established long before 1970 and teachers ' conditions of service prohibit sex discrimination in employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord browne-wilkinson
100	23	The method of appointment of teachers to promoted posts is subject to certain controls . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord browne-wilkinson
100	24	The pay and conditions of service of teachers and promoted teachers are dealt with by the S.J.N.C. , who issue circulars which , generally speaking and subject to a few exceptions , are binding on local authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord browne-wilkinson
100	25	The pay and conditions are subject to annual review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord browne-wilkinson
100	26	There is a common scale of remuneration for unpromoted teachers , the only reason for variation in the pay between unpromoted teachers being the point which they have reached on their scale , which depends upon length of service . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord browne-wilkinson
100	27	There is no doubt that a principal teacher receives higher remuneration than an unpromoted teacher . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord browne-wilkinson
100	28	The duties of teachers and principal teachers respectively are laid down in S.J.N.C. circulars . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord browne-wilkinson
100	29	Over the years there have been changes in the demand for certain subjects such as computing , for which demand has increased , or Latin , for which the demand has decreased . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord browne-wilkinson
100	30	However , in terms of the relevant conditions of employment , the respondents were obliged to preserve the existing structure of promoted posts , with the result that if a principal teacher of Latin had been appointed then , even if the number of pupils taking Latin fell to a fraction of what it had been , the principal teacher was entitled to continue to hold that appointment and to receive the appropriate salary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord browne-wilkinson
100	31	On the other hand , the respondents were not free simply to create new promoted posts to meet the demand for new subjects because they were restrained by the S.E.D. circulars relating to staffing standards . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord browne-wilkinson
100	32	Attempts have been made to provide flexibility within these standards but , as the industrial tribunal found , the degree of flexibility was in practice restricted by financial considerations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord browne-wilkinson
100	33	The respondents ' expenditure is met from resources raised by normal local and central government taxation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord browne-wilkinson
100	34	Any S.N.J.C. salary award has to be financed in such a way irrespective of any budget difficulties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord browne-wilkinson
100	35	At the time when the appellants launched these applications the educational budget amounted to about # 1 billion per annum representing about half the total regional budget . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord browne-wilkinson
100	36	There was a further difficulty in that there has been a significant drop in school rolls over the period 1980-1990 of approximately one-third . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord browne-wilkinson
100	37	The particular circumstances which obtain within each school determine the number of promoted posts to which appointment can be made in that school : i.e. the number of vacancies for promoted appointment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord browne-wilkinson
100	38	In a significant number of schools in the region -LRB- in particular , those in which the nine appellants were employed -RRB- conditions were such that there was a requirement for the work of a principal teacher to be done , but the application of the relevant rules to the school did not permit the appointment of a principal teacher to do such work . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord browne-wilkinson
100	39	In other words , there was no available vacancy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord browne-wilkinson
100	40	In that situation the appellants and doubtless other teachers found themselves in the position of doing the work of a principal teacher without having been promoted to that grade and without receiving the salary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord browne-wilkinson
100	41	The fact that the appellants did such work even though not paid at the appropriate rate is largely attributable to their sense of professional obligation to their students and their schools . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord browne-wilkinson
100	42	The industrial tribunal summarised the respondents ' case as follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord browne-wilkinson
100	43	They said that the difference in pay between the appellants and their comparators was due to a combination of five material factors , namely : -LRB- 1 -RRB- there was a promotion structure established by statute ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- promoted posts were filled only on merit after competition ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- the respondents ' financial circumstances have always prevented them from fully reacting to curriculum change ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- they introduced Standard Circular 65 to assist that process ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- the interaction of financial constraints and that circular prevents them making principal teacher appointments in schools where such appointments would be appropriate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord browne-wilkinson
100	44	Finally , I must state an agreed fact of the greatest importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord browne-wilkinson
100	45	The disparity in pay between the appellants and principal teachers has nothing to do with gender . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord browne-wilkinson
100	46	Of the 134 unpromoted teachers who claimed to be carrying out the duties of principal teachers , 81 were men and 53 women . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord browne-wilkinson
100	47	The selection by the appellants in this case of male principal teachers as comparators was purely the result of a tactical selection by these appellants : there are male and female principal teachers employed by the respondents without discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord browne-wilkinson
100	48	Therefore the objective sought by the appellants is to achieve equal pay for like work regardless of sex , not to eliminate any inequalities due to sex discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord browne-wilkinson
100	49	There is no such discrimination in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord browne-wilkinson
100	50	To my mind it would be very surprising if a differential pay structure which had no disparate effect or impact as between the sexes should prove to be unlawful under the Equal Pay Act 1970 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord browne-wilkinson
100	51	The preamble to that Act describes its purpose as being `` An Act to prevent discrimination , as regards terms and conditions of employment , between men and women . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord browne-wilkinson
100	52	The industrial tribunal apparently accepted a submission that , in order for the respondents to succeed in a subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- defence , it was necessary to analyse the five reasons for the disparity in pay between the appellants and principal teachers in order to establish whether such reasons `` justified '' the disparity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord browne-wilkinson
100	53	Only if the industrial tribunal had been satisfied that the respondents had no reasonable alternative but to require the appellants to do the work of a principal teacher for less pay would it have been prepared to hold that the respondents had `` justified '' such disparity and therefore have a subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord browne-wilkinson
100	54	The industrial tribunal reviewed all the evidence and reached the conclusion that the respondents had not discharged that burden and therefore had not `` justified '' the inequality in pay . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord browne-wilkinson
100	55	Like the Second Division , I consider that the industrial tribunal misdirected itself in adopting that approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord browne-wilkinson
100	56	If the words of subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- are read without reference to authority they do not present any great difficulty in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord browne-wilkinson
100	57	The subsection provides a defence if the employer shows that the variation between the woman 's contract and the man 's contract is `` genuinely '' due to a factor which is -LRB- a -RRB- material and -LRB- b -RRB- not the difference of sex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord browne-wilkinson
100	58	The requirement of genuineness would be satisfied if the industrial tribunal came to the conclusion that the reason put forward was not a sham or a pretence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord browne-wilkinson
100	59	For the matters relied upon by the employer to constitute `` material factors '' it would have to be shown that the matters relied upon were in fact causally relevant to the difference in pay , i.e. that they were significant factors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord browne-wilkinson
100	60	Finally , the employer had to show that the difference of sex was not a factor relied upon . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord browne-wilkinson
100	61	This final point is capable of presenting problems in other cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord browne-wilkinson
100	62	But in the present case it presents none : there is no suggestion that the matters relied on were in any way linked to differences in sex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord browne-wilkinson
100	63	If that approach had been adopted by the industrial tribunal , this case would have been straight forward . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord browne-wilkinson
100	64	The five factors summarised by the industrial tribunal were undoubtedly genuine reasons for there being a difference between the pay of the appellants and that of principal teachers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord browne-wilkinson
100	65	They were also significant and causally relevant factors leading to that disparity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord browne-wilkinson
100	66	They did not relate to sex in any way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord browne-wilkinson
100	67	Therefore , on the straight forward application of the section the respondents have established a subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord browne-wilkinson
100	68	There is nothing in the words of the subsection which requires the employer to `` justify '' the factors giving rise to this disparity by showing that there was no way in which the employer could have avoided such disparity if he had adopted other measures . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord browne-wilkinson
100	69	How then did the industrial tribunal come to mislead itself by introducing into the case the concept of `` justification '' ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord browne-wilkinson
100	70	The answer is that they wrongly thought that the authorities demanded such justification in every case where an employer seeks to establish a subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- defence whereas , on a proper reading , the question of justification only arises where a factor relied upon is gender discriminatory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord browne-wilkinson
100	71	Although in the present case there is no question of gender discrimination , the authorities are in such a state of confusion that it is desirable for your Lordships to seek to establish the law on a clear and sound basis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord browne-wilkinson
100	72	To establish a subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- defence , the employer has to prove that the disparity in pay is due to a factor `` which is not the difference of sex , '' i.e. is not sexually discriminatory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord browne-wilkinson
100	73	The question then arises `` what is sexually discriminatory ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord browne-wilkinson
100	74	Both the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and article 119 of the European Treaty recognise two types of sex discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord browne-wilkinson
100	75	First , there is direct discrimination , i.e. a detriment suffered by women which they would not have suffered but for being women . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord browne-wilkinson
100	76	Second , there is indirect discrimination , i.e. a detriment suffered by a class of individuals , men and women alike , but the class is such that a substantially larger number of women than men suffer the detriment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord browne-wilkinson
100	77	The classic example of indirect discrimination is a policy under which part-time workers , whether male or female , are paid less than full-time workers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord browne-wilkinson
100	78	There are many more women than men who are part-time workers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord browne-wilkinson
100	79	Accordingly such a policy applied to part-time workers is indirectly discriminatory against women . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord browne-wilkinson
100	80	Under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 , direct sexual discrimination is always unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord browne-wilkinson
100	81	But , both under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and under article 119 , indirect discrimination is not unlawful if it is `` justified : '' Sex Discrimination Act 1975 section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- -LRB- ii -RRB- ; Bilka-Kaufhaus G.m.b.h. v. Weber von Hartz -LRB- Case 170/84 -RRB- -LSB- 1987 -RSB- I.C.R. 110 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord browne-wilkinson
100	82	Indirect discrimination can be `` justified '' if it is shown that the measures adopted by the employers which cause the adverse impact on women `` correspond to a real need on the part of the -LSB- employers -RSB- , are appropriate with a view to achieving the objectives pursued and are necessary to that end : '' Rainey v. Greater Glasgow Health Board -LSB- 1987 -RSB- A.C. 224 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord browne-wilkinson
100	83	The cases establish that the Equal Pay Act 1970 has to be construed so far as possible to work harmoniously both with the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and article 119 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord browne-wilkinson
100	84	All three sources of law are part of a code dealing with unlawful sex discrimination : see Shields v. E. Coomes -LRB- Holdings -RRB- Ltd. -LSB- 1978 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 1408 and Garland v. British Rail Engineering Ltd. -LSB- 1983 -RSB- 2 A.C. 751 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord browne-wilkinson
100	85	It follows that the words `` not the difference of sex '' where they appear in section 1 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Equal Pay Act 1970 must be construed so as to accord with the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and article 119 , i.e. an employer will not be able to demonstrate that a factor is `` not the difference of sex '' if the factor relied upon is sexually discriminatory whether directly or indirectly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord browne-wilkinson
100	86	Further a sexually discriminatory practice will not be fatal to a subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- defence if the employer can `` justify '' it applying the test in the Bilka-Kaufhaus case -LSB- 1987 -RSB- I.C.R. 110 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord browne-wilkinson
100	87	In North Yorkshire County Council v. Ratcliffe -LSB- 1995 -RSB- I.C.R. 833 , 839 , this House expressed the view , obiter , that the Equal Pay Act 1970 has to be interpreted without introducing the distinction between direct and indirect discrimination drawn by section 1 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord browne-wilkinson
100	88	That dictum must not be carried too far . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord browne-wilkinson
100	89	Whilst there is no need to apply to the Equal Pay Act 1970 the hard and fast statutory distinction between the two types of discrimination drawn in the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 , this House did not intend , and had no power , to sweep away all the law on equal pay under article 119 laid down by the European Court of Justice , including the concept of justifying , on Bilka grounds , practices which have a discriminatory effect on pay and conditions of service . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord browne-wilkinson
100	90	The law on article 119 , whilst recognising that in many cases there is a de facto distinction between direct and indirect discrimination , does not draw the same firm legal demarcation between the two as does the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 which permits justification of indirect discrimination but not of direct discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord browne-wilkinson
100	91	The correct position under section 1 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Equal Pay Act 1970 is that even where the variation is genuinely due to a factor which involves the difference of sex , the employer can still establish a valid defence under subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- if he can justify such differentiation on the grounds of sex , whether the differentiation is direct or indirect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord browne-wilkinson
100	92	I am not aware as yet of any case in which the European Court of Justice has held that a directly discriminatory practice can be justified in the Bilka sense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord browne-wilkinson
100	93	However , such a position can not be ruled out since , in the United States , experience has shown that the hard and fast demarcation between direct and indirect discrimination is difficult to maintain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord browne-wilkinson
100	94	From what I have said , it is apparent that in considering section 1 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Equal Pay Act 1970 , the only circumstances in which questions of `` justification '' can arise are those in which the employer is relying on a factor which is sexually discriminatory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord browne-wilkinson
100	95	There is no question of the employer having to `` justify '' -LRB- in the Bilka sense -RRB- all disparities of pay . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord browne-wilkinson
100	96	Provided that there is no element of sexual discrimination , the employer establishes a subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- defence by identifying the factors which he alleges have caused the disparity , proving that those factors are genuine and proving further that they were causally relevant to the disparity in pay complained of . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord browne-wilkinson
100	97	Mr. Pannick , for the appellants , submitted that the industrial tribunal were right to consider whether the factors relied upon -LRB- even though not gender related -RRB- `` justified '' the disparity in pay . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord browne-wilkinson
100	98	He submitted that for a factor to be a `` material '' factor within subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- it had to be demonstrated that the matters relied upon unavoidably led to the disparity in pay : the Industrial Tribunal was throughout engaged upon was a consideration of whether the factors were `` material '' in that sense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord browne-wilkinson
100	99	I can not accept that submission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord browne-wilkinson
100	100	The words of the subsection indicate no requirement of such a justification inherent in the use of the words `` material factor . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord browne-wilkinson
100	101	It has long been established by the decision of this House in Rainey v. Greater Glasgow Health Board -LSB- 1987 -RSB- A , C. 224 , 235D that a factor is material if it is `` significant and relevant , '' a test which looks to the reason why there is a disparity in pay not whether there is an excuse for such disparity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord browne-wilkinson
100	102	To my mind decisively , if one were to accept Mr. Pannick 's submission that would be to turn the Equal Pay Act into a `` fair wages '' Act requiring the elimination of disparity in wages even though such disparity had nothing to do with sex discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord browne-wilkinson
100	103	As I have said , the preamble to the Act renders such an argument impossible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord browne-wilkinson
100	104	Mr. Pannick relied on a number of authorities in support of his submission that a factor could not be `` material '' unless it could be objectively justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord browne-wilkinson
100	105	In Jenkins v. Kingsgate -LRB- Clothing Productions -RRB- Ltd. -LSB- 1981 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 1485 , 1495 -LRB- a case dealing with part-time workers being paid at a lower rate -RRB- , the Employment Appeal Tribunal required objective justification of the reasons for the disparity in pay . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord browne-wilkinson
100	106	The decision was subsequently approved in the Rainey case in this House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord browne-wilkinson
100	107	But that was a case in which to pay part-time workers less was indirectly discriminatory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord browne-wilkinson
100	108	Therefore , a subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- defence would have failed unless such indirect sexual discrimination had been justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord browne-wilkinson
100	109	The `` justification '' in question was not of a disparity in wages between part-time workers and full-time workers but of discrimination between male workers and female workers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord browne-wilkinson
100	110	Similarly , in Barber v. N.C.R. -LRB- Manufacturing -RRB- Ltd. -LSB- 1993 -RSB- I.R.L.R. 95 the material factor relied upon for the purpose of the subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- defence was itself gender discriminatory and therefore had to be justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord browne-wilkinson
100	111	McPherson v. Rathgael Centre -LSB- 1991 -RSB- I.R.L.R. 206 was a case , such as the present , where there was no element of gender discrimination in the factor relied upon by the employers in mounting a subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord browne-wilkinson
100	112	The disparity in pay in question in that case was due to a simple mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord browne-wilkinson
100	113	The Court of Appeal of Northern Ireland held that the employer had to `` justify '' such disparity and had failed to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord browne-wilkinson
100	114	In my judgment , that case was wrongly decided since there was no sexual discrimination which called for justification in that case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord browne-wilkinson
100	115	In my judgment the law was correctly stated by Mummery J. giving the judgment of the Employment Appeal Tribunal in Tyldesley v. T.M.L. Plastics Ltd. -LSB- 1996 -RSB- I.C.R. 356 , in which he followed and applied the earlier E.A.T. decisions in Calder v. Roundtree Mackintosh Confectionary Ltd. -LSB- 1992 -RSB- I.C.R. 372 and Yorkshire Blood Transfusion Service v. Plaskitt -LSB- 1994 -RSB- I.C.R. 74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord browne-wilkinson
100	116	The purpose of section 1 of the Equal Pay Act 1970 is to eliminate sex discrimination in pay not to achieve fair wages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord browne-wilkinson
100	117	Therefore , if a difference in pay is explained by genuine factors not tainted by discrimination that is sufficient to raise a valid defence under subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- : in such a case there is no further burden on the employer to `` justify '' anything . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord browne-wilkinson
100	118	However if the factor explaining the disparity in pay is tainted by sex discrimination -LRB- whether direct or indirect -RRB- that will be fatal to a defence under subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- unless such discrimination can be objectively justified in accordance with the tests laid down in the Bilka and Rainey cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord browne-wilkinson
100	119	Finally , I must mention the ground on which the Employment Appeal Tribunal upheld the decision of the industrial tribunal , a ground which was further urged before us by Mr. Grant Hutchison , as junior counsel for the appellants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord browne-wilkinson
100	120	The argument is that the industrial tribunal , when engaged on their analysis of the reasons put forward by the respondents , were not impermissibly requiring the respondents to justify the disparity in pay . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord browne-wilkinson
100	121	It is said that the industrial tribunal were merely engaged in testing , and finding wanting , the evidence that the factors relied upon had caused the disparity in pay . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord browne-wilkinson
100	122	I am quite unable to read the reasons of the industrial tribunal in that sense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord browne-wilkinson
100	123	There was clear and largely uncontradicted evidence as to why the appellants were not paid the same rate as the principal teachers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord browne-wilkinson
100	124	The industrial tribunal was clearly accepting this evidence as far as it went but , wrongly , requiring the employers to go further and to `` justify '' the differential . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord browne-wilkinson
100	125	For these reasons , which are largely the same as those relied upon by the Second Division , I would dismiss this appeal . 	lord browne-wilkinson	self	outcome	0.9	lord browne-wilkinson
