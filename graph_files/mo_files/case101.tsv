101	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope
101	4	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope
101	5	I have had the advantage of reading in draft the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead . 	lord bingham	lord hope	ackn	0	lord hope
101	6	Save that I would , for reasons I have endeavoured to give in R -LRB- Countryside Alliance and others -RRB- v Attorney General and R -LRB- Derwin and others -RRB- v Attorney General -LSB- 2007 -RSB- UKHL 52 , hesitate to conclude that article 11 of the European Convention is not applicable , I am in agreement with my noble and learned friend 's reasoning and conclusions . 	lord bingham	lord hope	partagr	0	lord hope
101	7	For reasons also given in my opinion in the Countryside Alliance case I would hold that any interference with the appellant 's right under article 11 , if that article is engaged , is justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope
101	8	I would accordingly dismiss this appeal . 	lord bingham	self	outcome	0	lord hope
101	9	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope
101	10	LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope
101	11	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope
101	12	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope
101	13	This in an appeal against an interlocutor of an Extra Division of the Court of Session -LRB- Lord MacLean , Lady Paton and Lady Smith -RRB- -LRB- Friend v Lord Advocate -LSB- 2005 -RSB- CSIH 69 ; 2006 SC 121 -RRB- refusing a reclaiming motion by the appellant , Brian Leonard Friend , against an interlocutor of the Lord Ordinary -LRB- Lord Brodie -RRB- -LRB- Whaley v Lord Advocate , 2004 SC 78 -RRB- dismissing a petition in which the appellant and Jeremy Hagan Whaley sought judicial review of the enactment by the Scottish Parliament of the Protection of Wild Mammals -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 2002 -LRB- asp 6 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope
101	14	They sought review of the enactment on the ground that it was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights read together with the Race Relations Act 1976 and with a number of international obligations of the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope
101	15	Their case was that , for these reasons , the Act was outside the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament in terms of section 29 of the Scotland Act 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope
101	16	The petition was served on the Advocate General for Scotland , the Lord Advocate and the Scottish Ministers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope
101	17	It was responded to in the public interest by the Lord Advocate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope
101	18	Mr Whaley , who was the first named petitioner , did not insist on his reclaiming motion in the Inner House and is not a party to the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	19	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	20	Mr Friend , with the late Hugh Edward Thomas , also brought a claim in England seeking judicial review by way of a declaration of incompatibility of the Hunting Act 2004 with the Convention as scheduled to the Human Rights Act 1998 read together with the Race Relations Act 1976 and the same international obligations as those referred to in the proceedings in the Court of Session . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	21	Their claim was dismissed by the Divisional Court on 29 July 2005 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	22	Their application for permission to appeal was refused by the Court of Appeal , as it was not thought that the arguments deployed by Mr Friend and Mr Thomas had any real prospect of success : R -LRB- Countryside Alliance -RRB- v Attorney General -LSB- 2006 -RSB- EWCA Civ 817 , -LSB- 2007 -RSB- QB 305 , para 179 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	23	Mr Friend 's appeal against the interlocutor of the Court of Session has been brought without leave under section 40 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Court of Session Act 1988 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	24	He appeared in person before your Lordships to conduct his own appeal , as he has done throughout these proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	25	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	26	The Court of Appeal paid tribute to the admirable way in which Mr Friend and Mr Thomas prepared their documentary case and the clarity and moderation with which they presented their oral submissions in that court : para 173 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	27	I should like to add my own tribute to the way Mr Friend has conducted his case in your Lordships ' House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	28	He brought to life , in a charming and restrained but forceful way , the very real sense of injustice that he and others in his position feel about what these enactments have done to the hunting community . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	29	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	30	In his petition Mr Friend avers that he is an associate member of the Union of Country Sports Workers and follows what he describes as the ancient cultural activity and lifestyle of hunting with hounds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	31	His home is in Devon but he also owns cottages in Duns and Kelso . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	32	He joins with others to follow hounds on foot with the Berwickshire Hunt and other hunts both north and south of the Border . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	33	He also used to ride to hounds , but for the time being at least he no longer does so following an injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	34	He said that he was an ordinary person who enjoys hunting as a way of life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	35	He is convinced that hunting with hounds causes the least suffering of all methods used to control foxes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	36	As he put it , a fox which is hunted is either alive and free or it is dead . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	37	The kill is swift and it is efficient . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	38	The risk of wounding by shooting is avoided , as is the suffering that results from poisoning or the use of snares and traps . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	39	He felt that the legislators had not been impartial in their assessment of these issues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	40	They had targeted a group of people that they did not like . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	41	He was seeking the protection of the European Convention on Human Rights in the belief that these rights are available to everyone including ordinary people like himself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	42	He said that those who sought to take those rights away should answer for their actions in the courts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	43	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	44	Section 29 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Scotland Act -LRB- `` SA '' -RRB- provides that an Act of the Scottish Parliament is not law in so far as any provision is outside the legislative competence of the Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	45	Section 29 -LRB- 2 -RRB- SA defines the limits of the Parliament 's competence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	46	Paragraph -LRB- d -RRB- of that subsection provides that a provision is outside that competence if it is incompatible with any of the Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	47	It follows that the Protection of Wild Mammals -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 2002 -LRB- `` the Act '' -RRB- , like any other enactment of the Scottish Parliament , is open to scrutiny on this ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	48	Mr Friend , like everyone else , is entitled to the protection of the Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	49	The Convention exists to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of each and every individual : A v The Scottish Ministers , 2002 SC -LRB- PC -RRB- 63 , para 34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	50	People who are members of a group that is disliked , as Mr Friend puts it , are as much entitled to that protection as anyone else . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	51	The Convention is impartial as to whether one person or minority group is more deserving of protection than another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
101	52	The protection that it affords is available to everyone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	53	The function of the courts is to ensure that they receive that protection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	54	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	55	But the scrutiny to which enactments of the Scottish Parliament can be subjected for their protection does not extend any further than the limits which section 29 -LRB- 2 -RRB- SA has placed on the legislative competence of the Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	56	It is here that Mr Friend 's complaint that the Act is incompatible with the United Kingdom 's international obligations such as the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development of 1992 , principle 22 of which encourages support for traditional practices and the culture and identity of indigenous peoples , meets an insuperable obstacle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	57	International obligations 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	58	Mr Friend submitted that , as observing and implementing international obligations , obligations under the Human Rights Convention and obligations under Community law are all excluded by para 7 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of Schedule 5 SA from the list of reserved matters , the Scottish Parliament was obliged to observe and implement international obligations in just the same way as it was obliged to implement and observe the Convention rights and Community law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	59	That however is not how observing and implementing international obligations has been provided for by the Scotland Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	60	Section 126 -LRB- 10 -RRB- SA provides that in the Act the expression `` international obligations '' means any international obligations of the United Kingdom `` other than '' obligations to observe and implement Community law and the Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	61	The distinction that is inherent in the definition recognises that it is for Parliament , not the courts , to decide whether the international treaties should form part of domestic law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	62	On the one hand there are the Convention rights which have been incorporated into domestic law by the Human Rights Act 1998 and Community law which has been incorporated into domestic law by the European Communities Act 1972 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	63	On the other hand there are international obligations of the kind that have not been incorporated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	64	The international obligations that Mr Friend relies on all fall into the latter category . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	65	None of them are enforceable in the domestic courts as part of the law of Scotland . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	66	Nor is the Scottish Parliament bound to implement them , although it may choose to do so as they are not among the reserved matters that are outside its legislation competence : section 29 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- SA . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	67	As Mr Moynihan QC for the Lord Advocate put it , the Scottish Parliament has the right so to legislate , not a duty to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	68	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	69	Recognising that international obligations are not part of domestic law , the Scotland Act provides for them in a different way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	70	Section 35 -LRB- 1 -RRB- SA provides that the Secretary of State may make an order prohibiting the Presiding Officer from submitting a Bill for Royal Assent if it contains provisions which he has reasonable grounds to believe would be incompatible with any international obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	71	Section 58 -LRB- 1 -RRB- SA provides that the Secretary may also intervene at the stage when a Bill is introduced in the Parliament if he has reasonable grounds to believe that its introduction would be incompatible with any international obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	72	He may so do by directing by order that that action shall not be taken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	73	What these provisions do is enable the Secretary of State , who is a minister of the United Kingdom government , to intervene if he thinks it appropriate to do so in the interests , for example , of international comity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	74	They do not limit the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament in a way that can be decided upon by a court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	75	I agree with both the Lord Ordinary and the Extra Division that the averments that refer to the international obligations are irrelevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	76	The Convention rights 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	77	Mr Friend submits that the Act is incompatible with articles 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 and 14 of the Convention , all of which are included within the Convention rights for the purposes of section 29 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- d -RRB- SA . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	78	But he also claims the protection of the Convention as a whole , notwithstanding the exclusion of some of its articles from the definition of the Convention rights in section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Human Rights Act 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	79	He refers in particular to articles 17 and 53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	80	He also invokes his right to a fair trial under article 6 , on the ground that hunting and fishing is a civil right within the meaning of that article . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	81	Articles 17 and 53 11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	82	It is convenient to deal first with Mr Friend 's submissions with reference to articles 17 and 53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	83	I take them first because I do not think that they have any bearing on his basic argument , which is that the Act is not law because it is outside the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	84	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	85	Article 17 provides that nothing in the Convention may be interpreted as implying for any State , group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the limitation of any of the rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention to a greater extent than the Convention itself provides for . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
101	86	Section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Human Rights Act 1998 which defines the expression `` the Convention rights '' provides that the rights and fundamental freedoms set out in the articles listed in that subsection are to be read with , among others , that article . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	87	But in my opinion article 17 adds nothing , in the present context , to what section 29 SA itself provides . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	88	That section does all that the article seeks to achieve by providing that an Act of the Scottish Parliament is not law so far as any provision of the Act is incompatible with any of the Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	89	Mr Friend very fairly appreciated this point when it was put to him , and he did not insist on that part of his argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	90	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	91	After the hearing was over Mr Friend asked that his argument about this article be re-considered , on the ground that the Scottish Parliament 's Rural Affairs Committee had admitted in its Report -LRB- SP Paper 376 -RRB- that the Bill was intended to `` target mounted hunting '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	92	What the Report actually says is that it was Lord Watson 's stated aim `` to end cruelty '' , and it was to the question whether mounted hunts were cruel that the Committee addressed its attention : paras 4 , 10 , 46 , 98-102 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	93	Even if the Report is to be read as indicating that the intention was to target hunting , the fact remains that all the protection a person needs against legislation that is defective because it is incompatible with the Convention rights is to be found in section 29 SA . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	94	Section 29 -LRB- 1 -RRB- SA states that legislation which is outside the competence of the Scottish Parliament `` is not law . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	95	The section gives full effect to article 17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	96	But to obtain the benefit of it Mr Friend must show that the Act is incompatible with one or more of the Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	97	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	98	As for article 53 , it provides that nothing in the Convention shall be construed as limiting or derogating from any of the human rights and fundamental freedoms which may be ensured under the laws of any High Contracting Party or under any other agreement to which it is a party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	99	Mr Friend did not insist on this part of his case in the Inner House : 2006 SC 121 , para 25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	100	It has reappeared in his written case before your Lordships , so I make this brief comment on it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	101	The primary function of article 53 is to avoid any conflict between the Convention and any of the human rights and fundamental freedoms which are protected by the domestic laws of the Contracting State - under its written constitution , for example . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	102	In the United Kingdom context this means that it is not to be read as limiting or derogating from any other right or freedom conferred by or under any law having effect in any part of it : see section 11 of the Human Rights Act 1998 , which gives effect to this principle in domestic law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	103	But the limits of the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament are not defined by article 53 or section 11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	104	The protection that article 53 requires in this context is to be found , and to be found only , in the limits that are set by the Convention rights listed in section 1 of that Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	105	Articles 9 and 10 15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	106	I take these articles next , because it seems to me that neither of these articles is applicable to Mr Friend 's case and , in that sense , `` engaged '' by it : see my discussion of these terms in Harrow London Borough Council v Qazi -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 1 AC 983 , para 47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	107	It must follow that his averments in reliance on them are irrelevant because , even if true , they can not in law provide him with the remedy which he seeks . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	108	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	109	Article 9 says that everyone has the right to freedom of thought , conscience and religion and that this right includes the right , either alone or in community with others and in public or private , to manifest his religion or belief in practice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	110	Article 10 says that everyone has the right to freedom of expression and that this right includes freedom to hold opinions and to impart information and ideas without interference by public authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	111	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	112	Mr Friend said that hunting with hounds was a matter of conscience for the individual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	113	It was not for the many to impose their views on those who participated in it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	114	Hunting with dogs had been practised since the dawn of time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	115	His conscience permitted him to engage in the practice because he knows that foxes that are killed as a result of it will not be wounded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	116	He acknowledged this was a non-religious belief , and that for it to be protected by article 9 it must relate to an aspect of human life or behaviour of comparable importance to that normally found with religious beliefs : R -LRB- Williamson -RRB- v Secretary of State for Education and Employment -LSB- 2005 -RSB- 2 AC 246 , para 24 , per Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	117	But he said that his belief in his right to hunt was at least of comparable importance to him as his religious beliefs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	118	Indeed it was greater , for him , than it was for his church . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	119	The wearing of traditional hunting dress , which shows who is in charge of the hunt , was a visible expression of this part of the cultural life of the community . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	120	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
101	121	It is questionable whether Mr Friend 's insistence that his belief is comparable to a religious belief would stand up to examination in Strasbourg , as the Court of Appeal observed in R -LRB- Countryside Alliance -RRB- v Attorney General -LSB- 2007 -RSB- QB 305 , para 177 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	122	Looked at objectively , hunting with hounds is carried on mainly for pleasure and relaxation by those who take part in it : Chassagnou v France -LRB- 1999 -RRB- 29 EHRR 615 , para 105 -LRB- Commission -RRB- , para 108 -LRB- Court -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	123	So I doubt whether the threshold that Lord Nicholls identified in Williamson has been crossed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	124	It has been said repeatedly , following Lord Bingham of Cornhill 's observation in R -LRB- Ullah -RRB- v Special Adjudicator -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 2 AC 323 , para 20 , that national courts should not outpace the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	125	The current jurisprudence does not support the proposition that a person 's belief in his right to engage in an activity which he carries on for pleasure or recreation , however fervent or passionate , can be equated with beliefs of the kind that are protected by article 9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	126	It would be surprising if it did so , as it would be hard in that event to set any limits to the range of beliefs that would be opened up for protection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	127	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	128	As the Lord Ordinary observed , however , Mr Friend 's freedom to hold and impart information about the views that he holds about hunting and to manifest his beliefs by the wearing of traditional hunting dress in public is not really in issue in this case : 2004 SC 78 , para 74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	129	The Act does not compel him to act contrary to his conscience or to refrain from holding and giving visible expression to his beliefs about the practice of hunting in the way he dresses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	130	His freedom has been interfered with because the Act tells him that hunting with hounds remains lawful only if , once the targeted animal is found or emerges from cover , it is shot , or killed by a bird of prey , once it is safe to do so : see the exception in section 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	131	The activities which he is permitted to carry on have been limited to those permitted by the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	132	But this does not interfere with the holding or expression of beliefs about the practice of hunting , nor is the wearing of the dress that is traditionally associated with it prohibited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	133	Articles 8 and 11 20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	134	Mr Friend is not alone in claiming that the Act is incompatible with the rights that are protected by these articles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	135	They were invoked by the petitioners in Adams v Scottish Ministers , 2004 SC 665 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	136	They were invoked too by the appellants in the appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal in R -LRB- Countryside Alliance -RRB- v Attorney General which was heard immediately before the appeal in Mr Friend 's case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	137	There is already a substantial body of judicial opinion on the question whether these articles are engaged and , if so , whether the restrictions which the Act imposes can survive scrutiny as necessary in the public interest and proportionate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	138	As the ground has already been covered in so much detail elsewhere I shall confine myself to the essential points . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	139	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	140	Article 8 says that everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life , his home and his correspondence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	141	Mr Friend said that hunting with hounds is part of his private life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	142	It was what he did and wishes to be able to continue to do , as an ordinary person and a member of an ordinary family . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	143	It is his way of life , in common with other members of the hunting community . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	144	He maintained that the traditional way of life of the hunting community is equivalent to that of an ethnic group and that it is entitled to the same protection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	145	He said that these aspects of his private and family life were entitled to the protection of the article , with which the Act was incompatible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	146	These submissions raise two questions as to the scope of article 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	147	The first is whether the concept of `` private life '' embraces activities of the kind that Mr Friend wishes to engage in . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	148	The second is whether the hunting community to which he belongs is entitled to the protection that is accorded to ethnic minority communities whose traditional way of life is regarded as falling within the article . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	149	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	150	The scope of the expression `` private life '' in article 8 in the context of the practice of hunting has been examined by the Inner House in Adams v Scottish Ministers , 2004 SC 665 , paras 62-64 , and by the Court of Appeal in R -LRB- Countryside Alliance -RRB- v Attorney General -LSB- 2007 -RSB- QB 305 , paras 71-105 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	151	In each case it was concluded , after an examination of the relevant authorities , that it does not extend to the rights asserted by Mr Friend and others in the hunting community . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	152	I have reached the same conclusion , for the following reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	153	We are not concerned in this case with personal autonomy in the sense referred to in Pretty v United Kingdom -LRB- 2002 -RRB- 35 EHRR 1 , paras 61 and 66 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	154	This case is not about the choices that a person makes about his or her own body or physical identity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
101	155	It is not about respect for the home as the place where a person is entitled to be free from arbitrary interference by the public authorities : see Harrow London Borough Council v Qazi -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 1 AC 983 , para 50 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	156	In Giacomelli v Italy -LRB- 2006 -RRB- 45 EHRR 871 , para 76 , the European Court said that a home will usually be the place , the physically defined area , where private and family life develops and that the individual has a right to the quiet enjoyment of that area . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	157	But that is not what this case is about either . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	158	It is about Mr Friend 's right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	159	But this right , which recognises that it would be too restrictive to limit the notion of `` private life '' in article 8 to an inner circle in which the individual may live his own personal life as he chooses , is protected only `` to a certain degree '' : Niemietz v Germany -LRB- 1992 -RRB- 16 EHRR 97 , para 29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	160	As the Lord Justice Clerk -LRB- Gill -RRB- , delivering the opinion of the court , said in Adams , para 63 , it is fallacious to argue that , because a certain activity establishes and develops relationships with others , it is on that account within the scope of private life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	161	For people such as Mr Friend hunting with hounds is a way of life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	162	This is not just about how he spends his own time when he wishes to be left alone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	163	It affects how he behaves with other people too . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	164	Not all activities of that kind lie outside the scope of the protection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	165	But in this case it is possible to distinguish very clearly between what is public and what is private . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	166	Hunting with hounds by its very nature , is carried on in public and it has many social aspects to it which involve the wider community . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	167	Moreover the prohibition is directed at activities that are carried on in public , not what people who hunt do in private when they are not hunting . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	168	They lie outside the private sphere of a person 's existence which is protected by article 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	169	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	170	The argument that hunting is a traditional way of life which he should be permitted to engage in does not take Mr Friend any further . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	171	He made a valiant attempt to persuade your Lordships that those who participated in it were an ethnic group whose customs and practices in relation to hunting were entitled to protection in the same way as those of minority ethnic groups such as the Saami people in the north of Norway : G and E v Norway -LRB- 1983 -RRB- 35 DR 30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	172	The European Commission of Human Rights accepted that this minority group was entitled to respect for its nomadic lifestyle , which included moving their herds of reindeer in search of suitable grazing over considerable distances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	173	In Chapman v United Kingdom -LRB- 2001 -RRB- 33 EHRR 399 , para 73 , the Strasbourg court held that the applicant 's occupation of her caravan was an integral part of her ethnic gipsy travelling lifestyle , reflecting the long tradition of that minority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	174	But , as the Court of Appeal said in R -LRB- Countryside Alliance -RRB- v Attorney General -LSB- 2007 -RSB- QB 305 , para 100 , this argument seeks to convert protecting the rights of nomadic national or ethnic minorities into a generalised right of respect for minority community activities in general . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	175	There is no doubt that hunting with hounds has a rich cultural tradition of its own which has been built up over many years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	176	The customs and beliefs which are shared by those who participate in it are different from those shared by others in the population generally . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	177	But , as Mr Moynihan submitted , they are a minority in numerical terms only . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	178	They are not part of a recognised ethnic or national group to whose traditional activities article 8 extends its protection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	179	So this argument can not be extended to Mr Friend 's case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	180	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	181	Article 11 says that everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others , including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	182	The Inner House in Adams said that this article was engaged if a person was prohibited from doing something so long as he is a member of a particular association or is adversely treated by reason of his membership of it : para 81 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	183	But a restriction which prohibits an activity without reference to any association , with the result that persons can not associate for the purpose of carrying it out , was in a different category : para 82 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	184	The Court of Appeal in R -LRB- Countryside Alliance -RRB- v Attorney General , in agreement with the Lord Ordinary in this case at 2004 SC 78 , para 80 , was of the same opinion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	185	All the Act did was to prohibit a particular activity once the participants had assembled : para 107 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	186	In my opinion this is not a sufficient answer to the argument that the claimants are within the protection of article 11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	187	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	188	The principles on which the right of assembly has evolved have largely been developed in the context of political demonstrations : Clayton and Tomlinson , The Law of Human Rights -LRB- 2000 -RRB- , para 16.57 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
101	189	The two freedoms referred to in article 11 - the freedom of peaceful assembly and the freedom of association with others - may overlap , as where people assemble or move in procession in support of their right to belong to a trade union . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	190	The right to exercise these freedoms , combined with the freedom to hold opinions and the freedom to express them guaranteed by article 10 , is essential to the proper functioning of a modern democracy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	191	Taken together they provide protection for persons who , without belonging to any particular association or without any previously conceived plan or purpose , assemble for the purposes of a demonstration on a matter of public interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	192	In the field of public protest it would , I think , be wrong to say that the article had no application because the activity on which they were engaged did not begin until after the participants had assembled . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	193	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	194	But here again there are limits . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	195	There is a threshold that must be crossed before the article becomes applicable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	196	The essence of the freedom of assembly that article 11 guarantees is that it is a fundamental right in a democracy and , like the right to freedom of expression , is one of the foundations of such a society : Rassemblement Jurassien Unité Jurassienne v Switzerland -LRB- 1979 -RRB- 17 DLR 93 , 119 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	197	The situations to which it applies must relate to activities of comparable importance , of which the right to form and join a trade union to which article 11 refers to is an example . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	198	The purpose of the activity provides the key to its application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	199	It covers meetings in private as well as in public , but it does not guarantee a right to assemble for purely social purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	200	The right of assembly that Mr Friend seeks to assert is really no more than a right to gather together in a public place to take part in an activity which the Strasbourg court , agreeing with the Commission at para 105 , has held to be mainly for pleasure and recreation : Chassagnou v France -LRB- 1999 -RRB- 29 EHRR 615 , para 108 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	201	I agree with Lord Bingham that , where the activity which brings people together is prohibited , the effect is in reality to restrict their right to assemble . 	lord hope	lord bingham	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	202	But Mr Friend 's position is no different from that of any other person who wishes to assemble with others for sporting or recreational purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	203	It falls well short of the kind of assembly whose protection is fundamental to the proper functioning of a modern democracy and is , for that reason , guaranteed by article 11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	204	No decision of the Strasbourg Court has gone that far . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	205	I would hold that this article too is not applicable to Mr Friend 's case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	206	Article 14 27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	207	This article provides that the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex , race , colour , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , association with a national minority , property , birth or other status . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	208	Mr Friend maintains that he is being discriminated against by the Act because he follows the ancient practice of hunting with hounds which others find offensive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	209	He said that he was a member of a particular social group , which Labour politicians had denigrated not for what they did but because they were perceived , wrongly , to be toffs and Tories . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	210	It accorded different treatment to others , because it permitted the killing and pursuit of quarry species by methods that could not guarantee not to inflict more pain , and thus unnecessary suffering , than the use of hounds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	211	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	212	The Grand Chamber of the Strasbourg Court has held that article 14 complements the other substantive provisions of the Convention and the Protocols . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	213	It has no other independent existence since , according to its own terms , it has effect solely in relation to the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by those provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	214	But it does not necessarily presuppose the violation of one of the substantive rights guaranteed by the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	215	It is necessary , but also sufficient , for the facts of the case to fall within what has been described as `` the ambit '' of one or more of the Convention articles : Stec v United Kingdom -LRB- 2005 -RRB- 41 EHRR SE 295 , para 38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	216	The Grand Chamber added this explanation in para 39 : `` The prohibition of discrimination in article 14 thus extends beyond the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms which the Convention and Protocols require each state to guarantee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	217	It applies also to those additional rights , falling within the scope of any Convention article , for which the state has voluntarily decided to provide . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	218	As Lord Bingham of Cornhill said in R -LRB- Clift -RRB- v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2007 -RSB- 1 AC 484 , para 13 , expressions such as `` ambit '' are not precise and exact in their meaning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	219	As he put it : `` They denote a situation in which a substantive Convention right is not violated , but in which a personal interest close to the core of such a right is infringed . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	220	The paradigm case is one where the state , having set up an institution such as a school or other educational establishment , takes discriminatory measures within the meaning of article 14 read with article 2 of the First Protocol which are based on differences in the language of children attending schools in unilingual regions : see Belgian Linguistic Case -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LRB- 1968 -RRB- 1 EHRR 252 , para 32 Clift 's case provides another example closer to home . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	221	It was held that a scheme which had been set up by legislation for the early release of prisoners fell within the ambit of the right to liberty in article 5 of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	222	Differential treatment of prisoners otherwise than on the merits gave rise to a potential complaint of discrimination under article 14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
101	223	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	224	To attract the protection of the article the discrimination must also be on some ground which falls within the list which the article sets out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	225	This list is not exhaustive , but the words `` or other status '' at the end of the list show that it is not unlimited : R -LRB- S -RRB- v Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 1 WLR 2196 , para 48 , per Lord Steyn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	226	It does not preclude discrimination on any ground whatever . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	227	The principle was explained in Kjeldsen , Busk Madsen and Pedersen v Denmark -LRB- 1976 -RRB- 1 EHRR 711 , para 56 , where the Strasbourg court said : `` Article 14 prohibits , within the ambit of the rights and freedoms guaranteed , discriminatory treatment having as its basis or reason a personal characteristic -LRB- ` status ' -RRB- by which persons or groups of persons are distinguishable from each other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	228	However there is nothing in the contested legislation which can suggest that it envisaged such treatment '' The word `` envisaged such treatment '' in the last sentence -LRB- omitted from the quotations from this paragraph in Clift , paras 27 and 56 -RRB- are important . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	229	They suggest that the words `` personal characteristic '' are sensitive to the context in which the issue arises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	230	Something which might not strike one as a personal characteristic in the abstract may become apparent if it is the reason why the state decides to treat some people differently from other people in similar factual circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	231	It was on this part of his case that the argument broke down in Clift 's case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	232	He was unable to show that the length of his sentence conferred a status , or personal characteristic , on him within the meaning of the article because of which he was treated differently . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	233	But I would regard that case as lying close to the borderline . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	234	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	235	The question is whether , applying these principles , the Act is outside the competence of the Scottish Parliament because it is incompatible with article 14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	236	In my opinion Mr Friend 's argument that it is incompatible with that article fails on both points . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	237	For the reasons already given , I do not think that any of the other articles that he relies on are engaged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	238	Article 14 would be if he could show that this case nevertheless fell within , or was at least close to , the core of the values guaranteed by any one or more of those articles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	239	But this is not something that can be plucked out of the air . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	240	It must be related to something that , as it was put in Stec v United Kingdom -LRB- 2005 -RRB- 41 EHRR SE 295 , para 39 , the state has decided voluntarily to provide . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	241	Having done so , it can not limit access to it , restrict it or take it away on grounds that would conflict with any of the core values . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	242	That however is not this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	243	The Act is not directed at anything that the state itself has provided or seeks to provide . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	244	Its sole purpose is to restrict an activity in which persons can engage if they wish but in which the state itself is not involved at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	245	That is the principal reason why I would hold that Mr Friend 's case is not within the ambit of any of the rights guaranteed by the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	246	But I would also hold that the discrimination of which he complains is not directed at him on any of the grounds mentioned in article 14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	247	As the Lord Justice Clerk said in Adams v Scottish Ministers , 2004 SC 665 , paras 113-114 , it is the activity of hunting with hounds for sport that has been singled out for differential treatment , not participation in it by a particular sort of people or by people having a particular characteristic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	248	Moreover , looking at the matter from the point of view of Mr Friend as an individual , it is not on the ground of his political or other opinion or any other status that he is able to identify that this action has been taken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	249	The real reason for it lies in the nature of the activity , not any personal characteristic of his or of any of the many other people of all kinds and social backgrounds who participate in hunting . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	250	Justification 31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	251	If , as I would hold , none of the Convention rights on which Mr Friend founds are engaged in this case , it would follow that there is no need consider whether the incompatibility of which he complains is justified and proportionate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	252	Had this been necessary however I would have held that these requirements were satisfied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	253	The issues were considered by the Inner House in Adams v Scottish Ministers : 2004 SC 665 , paras 30-52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	254	On its analysis , with which I agree , the broad legislative aim of the 2002 Act was to prevent cruelty to animals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	255	Mounted foxhunting with hounds was considered to be cruel , as killing foxes by this method was done predominantly for sporting enjoyment and because there were thought to be other more effective and no more painful forms of pest control . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	256	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	257	Mr Friend vigorously disputed these conclusions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
101	258	But I agree with the Inner House that there was adequate factual information to entitle the Scottish Parliament to conclude that foxhunting inflicted pain on the fox and that there was an adequate and proper basis on which it could make the judgment that the infliction of such pain in such circumstances constituted cruelty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	259	The social impacts of the proposed legislation were for the legislature to judge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	260	As the Lord Justice Clerk observed in para 47 , the prevention of cruelty to animals has for over a century fallen within the constitutional responsibility of the legislature . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	261	The 2002 Act is to be seen as one more step on a long legislative sequence in which animal welfare has been promoted by the legislature in relation to contemporary needs and problems . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	262	The question whether the measures proposed were now necessary in a democratic society was pre-eminently one for the Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	263	Mr Moynihan was right to describe the effect of the Act , in the light of the activities which are excepted from the prohibition by sections 2 to 5 , as a restriction on mounted fox hunting , not a ban . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	264	That is how its effect has proved to be in practice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	265	The legislative aim was achieved in a way that was proportionate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	266	Article 6 33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	267	Mr Friend has invoked article 6 on the grounds that the right to hunt with hounds is a civil right and that he is entitled to a determination of his right to do so by an independent and impartial tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	268	He maintains that the Lord Ordinary 's decision to dismiss the petition following a first hearing , without hearing evidence , has deprived him of a full and impartial hearing pursuant to his right under the article . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	269	He did not suggest that there were grounds for doubting the impartiality of the Lord Ordinary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	270	In essence his complaint is that , because his petition was dismissed because his averments were irrelevant , he has not had a fair trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	271	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	272	I see no reason to doubt that the right to fish or hunt is a civil right within the meaning of article 6 : Könkämä v Sweden -LRB- 1996 -RRB- 87-A DR 78 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	273	In fact , the issue that has to be determined in this case is not whether Mr Friend has a right to hunt but whether it was within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament to interfere with , or limit , that right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	274	This point however is immaterial , as his right to have this issue too determined is a civil right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	275	Nor does it dispose of his reason for invoking article 6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	276	The question is whether a hearing on evidence is an essential component of a fair trial in a case where the judge is satisfied that , as the litigant 's averments are irrelevant , no good purpose would be served by continuing with the case for a determination as to whether the petitioner is able to show that his averments are true . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	277	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	278	The proposition only has to be stated for it to be obvious that it is untenable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	279	The question whether there is a relevant case can be determined on the pleadings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	280	This is always done by taking the averments pro veritate - assuming that they are true . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	281	A case which is found to be irrelevant is not assisted by the leading of evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	282	As it happens , as can be seen from his careful opinion , the Lord Ordinary was not short of documentary evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	283	He had before him the Report of the Rural Affairs Committee which , together with its appendices , provided him with a good deal of background information . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	284	He also had all the information that was needed to examine the progress of the Bill after it had reached that stage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	285	Mr Friend was in a position to provide further information at first hand about his own beliefs and personal circumstances , as he did without objection when he was addressing your Lordships . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	286	He has been given ample opportunity to present his case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	287	Indeed he went out of his way to express his appreciation of the courtesy that had been shown to him throughout this litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope

101	289	Conclusion 36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	290	I agree with the Extra Division that the Lord Ordinary was right to dismiss the petition , although I have not reached this conclusion entirely for the same reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
101	291	I would dismiss the appeal . 	lord hope	self	outcome	0.8	lord hope

101	293	LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	294	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	295	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	296	I have had the advantage of considering the speech of my noble and learned friend , Lord Hope of Craighead , in draft . 	lord rodger	lord hope	ackn	0.9	lord hope
101	297	So far as the `` private life '' aspect of article 8 is concerned , despite the compelling way that he presented his case , I would hold that Mr Friend 's Convention right is not engaged for the reasons which I have set out in my speech in R -LRB- Countryside Alliance and others -RRB- v Attorney General and R -LRB- Derwin and others -RRB- v Attorney General -LSB- 2007 -RSB- UKHL 52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	298	In short , when engaged in the public spectacle of hunting , Mr Friend and others who hunt are not entitled to the guarantees relating to the `` private life '' of individuals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	299	For the rest , I agree with what Lord Hope says and would accordingly dismiss the appeal for the reasons which he gives . 	lord rodger	lord hope	fullagr	0.9	lord hope

101	301	BARONESS HALE OF RICHMOND 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	302	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	303	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	304	I too agree that this appeal should be dismissed , essentially for the same reasons as those given by my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead . 	lady hale	lord hope	fullagr	0.9	lord hope
101	304	I too agree that this appeal should be dismissed , essentially for the same reasons as those given by my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead . 	lady hale	self	outcome	0.9	lord hope
101	305	On the central questions of the scope and applicability of articles 8 and 11 , I have explained my reasoning in more detail in the related cases of R -LRB- Countryside Alliance and others -RRB- v Attorney General and R -LRB- Derwin and others -RRB- v Attorney General -LSB- 2007 -RSB- UKHL -LSB- 00 -RSB- -LRB- `` Countryside Alliance '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	306	Much of that reasoning is addressed to the case which Mr Friend has put so attractively before us and so I hope that he will refer to it for a fuller explanation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	307	I agree with him entirely that the Human Rights Act is for the benefit of ordinary people who lead ordinary lives : it is to protect them inter alia against arbitrary interceptions of their mail , email and telephone conversations , searches of their homes and persons , arrest , prolonged imprisonment without charge or trial , enforced separation from their children and families , trials in secret before military tribunals , inhuman and degrading treatment in hospital and care homes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	308	In short , the Human Rights Act brings `` something for everyone '' -LRB- Jenny Watson , Something for Everyone : the Impact of the Human Rights Act and the Need for a Human Rights Commission , British Institute for Human Rights , 2002 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	309	It may well be that , in practice , the people who have had most need of its protection are rather out of the ordinary ; but that does not alter the fact that it is there to protect us all as we go about our everyday lives . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	310	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	311	But there is a difference between a fundamental human right and the freedom to do as one pleases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	312	The convention rights were drafted to address specific abuses of power and as a check upon what even a democratically elected Parliament and executive could do . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	313	Although their scope can grow and develop over time , they have not yet been developed to cover every interference by Parliament with what we might otherwise want to do . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	314	In my view , article 8 `` protects the private space , both physical and psychological , within which individuals can develop and relate to others around them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	315	But that falls some way short of protecting everything they might want to do even in that private space ; and it certainly does not protect things that they can only do by leaving it and engaging in a very public gathering and activity '' : Countryside Alliance , para 116 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	316	Article 11 is addressed to public as well as private gatherings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	317	It `` protects the freedom to meet and band together with others in order to share information and ideas and to give voice to them collectively '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	318	Taken together , articles 10 and 11 `` protect the freedom to share and express opinions , and to try to persuade others to one 's point of view , which are essential political freedoms in any democracy '' : ibid , para 118 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	319	They do not protect everything which a group of people might wish to do when they get together . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	320	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	321	If a particular piece of legislation does fall within the scope of the rights protected by articles 8 , 9 , 10 , and 11 , then Parliament can be called upon to justify it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	322	On the face of it , the justifications permitted by those articles are quite narrowly drafted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	323	I sympathise with Mr Friend 's difficulty in understanding how the hunting ban could be said to be `` necessary in a democratic society '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	324	My answer is that `` when the Convention was written it would not have crossed anyone 's mind that there might be a prima facie right to hunt wild animals with dogs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	325	If the Convention has to be expanded to encompass such a right , then the qualifications have to be expanded too . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
101	326	The concept of what may be ` necessary in a democratic society ' has to take into account the comparative importance of the right infringed in the scale of rights protected '' : ibid , para 124 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope
101	327	When it comes to the protection of morals , the Convention also has to take account of the very different importance attached to certain moral values in different member states . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope
101	328	The British have long attached importance to protecting animals from harm and the hunting ban is simply the latest in a long line of legislation to that end . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope
101	329	The fact that Parliament might have gone further or done differently does not mean that what it has done can not be justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope
101	330	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope
101	331	If we could confidently predict that the European Court of Human Rights would find that the hunting ban did engage these Convention rights and could not be justified , then in my view it would be our duty to say so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope
101	332	Even though it is the recently enacted Act of a democratic Parliament , we could not wash our hands of the matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope
101	333	But we certainly can not confidently so predict in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope
101	334	We must , I think , leave it to Strasbourg to tell the United Kingdom if it has got it wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope
101	335	That , in short , is why Mr Friend 's attractive appeal must fail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope
101	336	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope
101	337	LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope
101	338	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope
101	339	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope

101	341	Mr Friend should know , however , that I had considerable sympathy for his submissions -LRB- which could not have been more beguilingly put -RRB- and that they contributed to the views about the hunting ban which I have expressed in my opinion in the parallel appeal brought by the Countryside Alliance .
