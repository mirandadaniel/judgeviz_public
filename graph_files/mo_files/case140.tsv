140	15	Police officers in Northern Ireland have suffered great hardships over many years as the result of the civil disturbances and their manifold consequences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell
140	16	Some 300 were murdered by paramilitaries and many others sustained serious injuries . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell
140	17	Numbers of them had to move home , sometimes at very short notice because of an immediate threat of attack . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell
140	18	They regularly kept secret , even from their neighbours and friends , the fact that they served in the police and concealed their occupation in documents wherever possible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell
140	19	They and their families lived under constant threat , and could never feel free completely from fear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell
140	20	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell
140	21	In spite of these pressures they constantly gave evidence in criminal and civil trials without concealment of their identities or appearance , to the great benefit of the system of justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell
140	22	Their fortitude in this and other respects was no doubt sustained in the worst times by a strong feeling of solidarity in the fight against terrorism . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell
140	23	Now that the security situation has improved to a significant extent , it is understandable if the fears which they surmounted or suppressed in dangerous times have returned more keenly when they feel that their safety is put under threat . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell
140	24	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell
140	25	This feeling underlies the applications which are the subject of the appeal before the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell
140	26	The Robert Hamill Inquiry proposes to call as witnesses a number of police officers who served in the Royal Ulster Constabulary -LRB- `` RUC '' -RRB- , of whom some are retired and some are now serving in the Police Service of Northern Ireland -LRB- `` PSNI '' -RRB- , the successor to the RUC . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord carswell
140	27	Some of these persons , when notified by the Inquiry of its intention to call them , made application to have their names withheld and to be screened from the view of the public while giving evidence -LRB- I shall refer to the relief sought compendiously as `` anonymity '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell
140	28	Their applications were , with one exception , refused by the members of the panel constituting the tribunal , on grounds to which I shall refer in more detail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell
140	29	The eleven respondents to the present appeal brought an application for judicial review of the tribunal 's decision and by an order dated 3 November 2006 Morgan J quashed the decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell
140	30	The Court of Appeal -LRB- Kerr LCJ , Campbell and Girvan LJJ -RRB- on 5 February 2007 dismissed the appeal brought against that order by the Robert Hamill Inquiry , the appellant before your Lordships ' House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell
140	31	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell
140	32	The Inquiry was set up to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the death of Robert Hamill , who died on 8 May 1997 from injuries received during an affray in Portadown , Co Armagh in the early hours of 27 April 1997 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell
140	33	From an early stage the incident gave rise to public concern and a degree of controversy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell
140	34	It is claimed by the family of the deceased man that the attack was sectarian , in that Mr Hamill , a Catholic , was set upon and beaten and kicked by a number of Protestants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell
140	35	It is alleged that there were several police officers in a Land Rover nearby , but that none attempted to stop the assault , and an innuendo of collusion with the attackers has received wide circulation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell
140	36	It is further alleged that one officer obstructed the subsequent investigation into the incident by giving assistance to one of the persons suspected of participation in the assault . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell
140	37	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell
140	38	No person has been convicted of the murder of Mr Hamill . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell
140	39	One suspect , Marc Hobson , was tried for his murder , but was convicted only of affray . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell
140	40	The controversy did not abate and this case , along with those relating to several other deaths which occurred in controversial circumstances , was referred to Mr Justice Cory , a retired judge of the Supreme Court of Canada . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell
140	41	He recommended , inter alia , that a public inquiry should be held into the death of Robert Hamill . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell
140	42	In November 2004 the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland set up the Inquiry , with the following terms of reference : 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell
140	43	The tribunal proposes to call a large number of witnesses , including the respondents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell
140	44	The Inquiry is to be held in accordance with the provisions of the Inquiries Act 2005 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord carswell
140	45	Under section 17 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of that Act the procedure and conduct of the inquiry are to be such as the chairman may direct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell
140	46	By section 18 there is to be public access to the proceedings , but section 19 provides for the imposition of restrictions on such access or the disclosure or publication of any evidence or documents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell
140	47	The chairman may make a restriction order , specifying restrictions which he considers to be conducive to the inquiry fulfilling its terms of reference or to be necessary in the public interest , having regard in particular to the matters mentioned in section 19 -LRB- 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell
140	48	Those matters include `` any risk of harm or damage that could be avoided or reduced by any such restriction '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell
140	49	`` Harm or damage '' is defined in subsection -LRB- 5 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- as including death or injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell
140	50	It was not in dispute that the restrictions consisting of anonymity sought by the respondents are among those which the chairman is empowered to order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell
140	51	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell
140	52	By letter dated 29 June 2005 the respondents ' solicitors lodged an application for anonymity on behalf of some 29 serving and former police officers , among whom were included most of the respondents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell
140	53	Other applications appear to have been received by the Inquiry over a period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell
140	54	It was contended by the solicitors that all the applicants were in fear for their lives , for reasons which were more pressing in some cases than in others , but expressed to be especially strong in the case of those officers who had been present at the scene of the affray in which Robert Hamill was attacked , and who had been persistently vilified as having been responsible for his death . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell
140	55	It was claimed that the discharge of their duties had made some a target for loyalist paramilitaries because they had participated in the arrest and interview of persons suspected of causing Mr Hamill 's death and the subsequent prosecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell
140	56	Others were concerned that if they were publicly identified as police officers it would be dangerous for them in the communities in which they lived in the Mid-Ulster area , where paramilitary activity was especially rampant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell
140	57	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell
140	58	The Inquiry requested the PSNI to carry out a general risk assessment in respect of witnesses who were to give evidence , and received the following reply : This indication was later supplemented in a letter from the PSNI enclosing details in response to a request from the Inquiry for individual risk assessments in respect of the respondents : 11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell
140	59	Detailed written applications for anonymity were made on 28 March 2006 by the respondents ' solicitors on behalf of those former members of the RUC whom the Inquiry intended to call as witnesses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell
140	60	The chairman refused the application , but offered the opportunity for a fresh consideration by the full tribunal at an oral hearing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell
140	61	The respondents , along with other persons , took up the opportunity and an oral hearing was held on 15 and 16 May 2006 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell
140	62	Applications for restriction orders were made at the hearing on behalf of all former and serving police officers who were to be called as witnesses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord carswell
140	63	Not all were able to attend and oral evidence was given by the respondents in support of the submissions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell
140	64	The tribunal obtained detailed information about each of the respondents and features of the general security situation in Northern Ireland relevant to the position of the police witnesses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell
140	65	Written submissions were also made by a number of persons and bodies concerning the applications . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell
140	66	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell
140	67	The burden of the applicants ' submissions was that by giving evidence without any protection by way of anonymity they would be exposed to an increased risk of terrorist attack . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell
140	68	They expressed what the submissions described as a `` reasonable and genuine fear '' that they would be targeted if their names and appearance became known to a terrorist group and they were identified as having a connection with the incident the subject of the Inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell
140	69	They highlighted their concerns about the possibility of reprisals from a dissident terrorist group as a result of the publicity which would be attendant upon the Inquiry and the allegations which would be made against the police . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell
140	70	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell
140	71	The submissions were advanced under two heads , first , that to compel the applicants to give evidence without anonymity would constitute a breach of article 2 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms -LRB- `` the Convention '' -RRB- and , secondly , that it would be a breach of the common law duty of fairness to the witnesses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell
140	72	The tribunal pointed out in its decision that the protection sought under article 2 , if the applicants ' case were made out , is also available at common law , but the common law goes further in providing protection to witnesses in appropriate cases which is not available under article 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell
140	73	It therefore considered separately the principles and the applicants ' case under each heading . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell
140	74	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell
140	75	The Inquiry gave its decision on the applications in a written ruling dated 3 August 2006 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell
140	76	It commenced by setting out its analysis of the questions which arose for determination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell
140	77	So far as relevant to the respondents , this read as follows -LRB- I have renumbered the last portion to remove a duplication of number -LRB- vi -RRB- -RRB- : 15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell
140	78	The tribunal went on to consider in detail the evidence relating to these factors , and stated that that evidence , taken without the evidence of the applicants themselves , led it to conclude that question I which it had posed , relating to article 2 of the Convention , must be answered in the negative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell
140	79	It then looked at the individual cases and considered the evidence presented by each applicant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell
140	80	Its conclusion remained unchanged , that the applications made under article 2 should be rejected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord carswell
140	81	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell
140	82	In considering the applications under the common law heading the tribunal examined the evidence about the fears entertained by the several applicants , bearing in mind its finding that fears of an increased risk were not well founded in fact . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell
140	83	It conducted the balancing exercise between protecting the applicants and easing their fears and what Cory J described as the aim `` to restore public confidence in the police and the judicial system . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell
140	84	It expressed its `` clear conclusion '' that 17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell
140	85	The respondents brought an application in the Northern Ireland High Court for judicial review , seeking to have the tribunal 's decision quashed on the grounds that -LRB- a -RRB- the tribunal misdirected itself in law -LRB- b -RRB- in the alternative , if it did apply the correct test , its decision was unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell
140	86	Morgan J in his judgment considered only the first ground , which he decided in favour of the applicants , the respondents to the present appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell
140	87	In view of the conclusions which I have reached , I do not need to discuss the judge 's decision further and shall turn to that of the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell
140	88	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell
140	89	The Court of Appeal in a written judgment given by Kerr LCJ on 5 February 2007 dismissed the Inquiry 's appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell
140	90	It confined its consideration to the tribunal 's ruling in relation to article 2 of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell
140	91	It held that the tribunal was in error in holding that it was necessary to find that a materially increased risk to the applicants for anonymity would arise from their giving evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell
140	92	Its opinion regarding the proper test was contained in paragraph 42 of its judgment , which was the focus of the criticism of the court 's decision in the submissions advanced to the House by Mr Underwood QC on behalf of the appellant : The Court of Appeal accordingly held that the tribunal applied the wrong test , and that it was not inevitable that the same conclusion would have been reached if the tribunal had asked the question which the court regarded as correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell
140	93	It did not express any opinion on the issue of Wednesbury unreasonableness , which had not been the subject of argument before it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell
140	94	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell
140	95	The right to life is simply and briefly expressed in the first sentence of article 2 of the Convention : `` Everyone 's right to life shall be protected by law . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell
140	96	As the Strasbourg jurisprudence has laid down , this covers not only the negative obligation , not to take the life of another person , but imposes on contracting states a positive obligation , to take certain steps towards the prevention of loss of life at the hands of others than the state . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell
140	97	The locus classicus of this doctrine is Osman v United Kingdom -LRB- 1998 -RRB- 29 EHRR 245 , paragraphs 115-6 of which read : 20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell
140	98	Two matters have become clear in the subsequent development of the case-law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord carswell
140	99	First , this positive obligation arises only when the risk is `` real and immediate '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell
140	100	The wording of this test has been the subject of some critical discussion , but its meaning has been aptly summarised in Northern Ireland by Weatherup J in Re W 's Application -LSB- 2004 -RSB- NIQB 67 , where he said that : It is in my opinion clear that the criterion is and should be one that is not readily satisfied : in other words , the threshold is high . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell
140	101	There was a suggestion in paragraph 28 of the judgment of the court in R -LRB- A and others -RRB- v Lord Saville of Newdigate -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 WLR 1249 , 1261 -LRB- also known as the Widgery Soldiers case , to distinguish it from the earlier case with a very similar title -RRB- that a lower degree would engage article 2 when the risk is attendant upon some action that an authority is contemplating putting into effect itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell
140	102	I shall return to this case later , but I do not think that this suggestion is well founded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell
140	103	In my opinion the standard is constant and not variable with the type of act in contemplation , and is not easily reached . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell
140	104	Moreover , the requirement that the fear has to be real means that it must be objectively well-founded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell
140	105	In this respect the approach adopted by Morgan J was capable of causing confusion when he held that the tribunal should have commenced by assessing the subjective nature of the fears entertained by the applicants for anonymity before going on to assess the extent to which those fears were objectively justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell
140	106	That is a valid approach when considering the common law test , but in assessing the existence of a real and immediate risk for the purposes of article 2 the issue does not depend on the subjective concerns of the applicant , but on the reality of the existence of the risk . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell
140	107	As the Court of Appeal indicated in paragraph 33 of its judgment , the existence of subjective fears is not a prerequisite to the finding that there is a risk which satisfies the test of article 2 , and , conversely , if a risk to life exists , article 2 will be engaged even if the person affected robustly disclaims having any subjective fears . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell
140	108	That is not to say that the existence of a subjective fear is evidentially irrelevant , for it may be a pointer towards the existence of a real and immediate risk , but in the context of article 2 it is no more than evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell
140	109	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell
140	110	Secondly , there is a reflection of the principle of proportionality , striking a fair balance between the general rights of the community and the personal rights of the individual , to be found in the degree of stringency imposed upon the state authorities in the level of precautions which they have to take to avoid being in breach of article 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell
140	111	As the ECtHR stated in paragraph 116 of Osman , the applicant has to show that the authorities failed to do all that was reasonably to be expected of them to avoid the risk to life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell
140	112	The standard accordingly is based on reasonableness , which brings in consideration of the circumstances of the case , the ease or difficulty of taking precautions and the resources available . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell
140	113	In this way the state is not expected to undertake an unduly burdensome obligation : it is not obliged to satisfy an absolute standard requiring the risk to be averted , regardless of all other considerations : cf McBride , Protecting life : a positive obligation to help , -LRB- 1999 -RRB- 24 European Law Review Human Rights Survey , HR/43 , HR/52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell
140	114	It has not been definitively settled in the Strasbourg jurisprudence whether countervailing factors relating to the public interest - such matters as the credibility of the Inquiry and its role in restoring public confidence -- as distinct from the practical difficulty of providing elaborate or far-reaching precautions , may be taken into account in deciding if there has been a breach of article 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell
140	115	It does appear that it may be correct in principle to take such factors into account -LRB- cf Re Donaghy 's Application -LSB- 2002 -RSB- NICA 25 and Re Meehan 's Application -LSB- 2003 -RSB- NICA 34 -RRB- , but I would prefer to reserve my opinion on the point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell
140	116	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord carswell
140	117	The principles which apply to a tribunal 's common law duty of fairness towards the persons whom it proposes to call to give evidence before it are distinct and in some respects different from those which govern a decision made in respect of an article 2 risk . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell
140	118	They entail consideration of concerns other than the risk to life , although as the Court of Appeal said in paragraph 8 of its judgment in the Widgery Soldiers case , an allegation of unfairness which involves a risk to the lives of witnesses is pre-eminently one that the court must consider with the most anxious scrutiny . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell
140	119	Subjective fears , even if not well founded , can be taken into account , as the Court of Appeal said in the earlier case of R v Lord Saville of Newdigate , ex p A -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 1 WLR 1855 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell
140	120	It is unfair and wrong that witnesses should be avoidably subjected to fears arising from giving evidence , the more so if that has an adverse impact on their health . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell
140	121	It is possible to envisage a range of other matters which could make for unfairness in relation of witnesses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell
140	122	Whether it is necessary to require witnesses to give evidence without anonymity is to be determined , as the tribunal correctly apprehended , by balancing a number of factors which need to be weighed in order to reach a determination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell
140	123	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell
140	124	The question posed by the Inquiry when considering article 2 was whether the pre-existing risk of death to an applicant for anonymity would be materially increased if he or she were required to give evidence without being afforded anonymity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell
140	125	Although it did not specifically so state in its ruling , it is inherent in all its discussion of the article 2 issue that the Inquiry did not consider that the pre-existing risk to any of the respondents or other applicants was sufficiently severe to reach the article 2 level of a real and immediate risk . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell
140	126	In its question which I have quoted it stated that the evidence from the PSNI was that all serving and former police officers were at `` some risk of death or injury from attacks upon them by paramilitaries . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell
140	127	This theme recurs in several places in the ruling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell
140	128	The Inquiry stated that no police officer had been killed since 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell
140	129	None of the applicants appears to have averred that he or she was subject to a real and immediate risk of death as matters stood , apart from giving evidence , and there is no such indication to be found in the tribunal 's discussion of the individual threat assessments received in respect of a number of applicants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell
140	130	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell
140	131	Starting from that premise , the tribunal accordingly posed the question whether in respect of any applicant the risk would be materially increased if he or she were required to give evidence without anonymity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell
140	132	In my opinion that was a correct test to apply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell
140	133	The Court of Appeal considered that it was an incorrect test . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell
140	134	At paragraph 42 of its judgment it commenced by posing the question `` will the requirement to give evidence give rise to a real risk to life ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord carswell
140	135	I would regard that as an appropriate question to ask . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell
140	136	It then went on to express its conclusion , however , that the proper question to ask is a simple one `` Is there a real risk ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell
140	137	rather than `` Is there an increase in the risk ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell
140	138	I can not regard that as correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell
140	139	If there is not a real and immediate risk to the life of an applicant before he or she gives evidence , then ex hypothesi to reach that threshold there must be some increase in risk occasioned by giving evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell
140	140	Only if that is the case can the requirement to give evidence `` give rise to '' a real risk to life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell
140	141	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell
140	142	The tribunal accordingly approached the matter properly under article 2 in seeking to ascertain whether giving evidence would give rise to a materially increased risk to life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell
140	143	Having found that it did not , it did not require then to go on to consider whether such an increased risk , if found to exist , would come up to the threshold required of a real and immediate risk to life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell
140	144	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell
140	145	It was also correct in asking the same question when considering the common law duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell
140	146	If the risk has not been increased , then it is not unfair on that account to require a witness to give evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell
140	147	It went on , again correctly in my opinion , to assess the relevant factors other than actual risk to life which could make it unfair to require witnesses to testify without anonymity , that is , the subjective fears which many of them expressed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell
140	148	It carried out a proper balancing exercise and concluded that the balance came down against allowing the applications for anonymity , then took into account medical evidence in order to determine if that affected its conclusions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell
140	149	In my opinion the tribunal applied the correct tests and the decisions of Morgan J and the Court of Appeal can not be sustained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell
140	150	I have purposely refrained from expressing any opinion on the tribunal 's justification for reaching its conclusions on the evidence before it , for the issue of Wednesbury unreasonableness was not discussed or resolved by the courts below . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell
140	151	That issue must now be remitted to the judge for determination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell
140	152	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord carswell
140	153	These conclusions are sufficient to dispose of the appeal before the House , but it may be timely and of assistance to future tribunals to say a word about the relationship between the article 2 consideration of anonymity and that which is decided by reference to the common law principles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell
140	154	In paragraph 31 of its judgment in the Widgery Soldiers case the Court of Appeal attempted to accommodate the requirements of article 2 and those of the common law in a single exercise : 28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell
140	155	I would not support this exercise in its entirety in the terms in which it was expressed , for while the balancing is appropriate in applying the common law test , the determination of the precautions which the tribunal should have to put in place is a different matter and does not depend on application of identical factors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell
140	156	I think that it is possible , however , to conduct the exercise basically as a single test , which is obviously desirable in the interests of simplicity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell
140	157	This could be done by approaching it as a single decision under the common law , having regard in the process to the requirements of article 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell
140	158	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell
140	159	In pursuit of this end , I suggest that the exercise to be carried out by the tribunal faced with a request for anonymity should be the application of the common law test , with an excursion , if the facts require it , into the territory of article 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell
140	160	Such an excursion would only be necessary if the tribunal found that , viewed objectively , a risk to the witness 's life would be created or materially increased if they gave evidence without anonymity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell
140	161	If so , it should decide whether that increased risk would amount to a real and immediate risk to life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell
140	162	If it would , then the tribunal would ordinarily have little difficulty in determining that it would be reasonable in all the circumstances to give the witnesses a degree of anonymity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell
140	163	That would then conclude the exercise , for that anonymity would be required by article 2 and it would be unnecessary for the tribunal to give further consideration to the matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell
140	164	If there would not be a real and immediate threat to the witness 's life , then article 2 would drop out of consideration and the tribunal would continue to decide the matter as one governed by the common law principles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell
140	165	In coming to that decision the existence of subjective fears can be taken into account , on the basis which I earlier discussed -LRB- see paragraph 22 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell
140	166	For the same reasons as those which I have set out in paragraph 20 , however , I would not regard it as essential in every case to commence consideration of the issue by seeking to identify such subjective fears . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell
140	167	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell
140	168	For the reasons which I have given earlier I would allow the appeal . 	lord carswell	self	outcome	0.9	lord carswell
140	169	I would remit the application for judicial review , in so far as it is based on Wednesbury unreasonableness , to the High Court for further consideration on that issue alone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord carswell
