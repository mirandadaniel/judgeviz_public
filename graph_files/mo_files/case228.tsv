228	2	LORD SLYNN OF HADLEY 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
228	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
228	4	I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech prepared by my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann in which he has referred to the facts , the statutory provisions and the relevant authorities . 	lord slynn	lord hoffmann	ackn	0	lord hoffmann
228	5	Although the agreement between Mr. Bruton and the Housing Trust is described as a licence and , since the Trust itself had only a licence it may have been intended to be only a licence , on the basis of Street v. Mountford -LSB- 1985 -RSB- A.C. 809 and Westminster City Council v. Clarke -LSB- 1992 -RSB- A.C. 288 , it is clear that the agreement gives a right to exclusive possession and prima facie is a tenancy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
228	6	The only doubt I have had is as to whether , as Street v. Mountford contemplated to be possible , this prima facie conclusion is displaced by other relevant factors , what in Street v. Mountford are called `` surrounding circumstances . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
228	7	The surrounding circumstances relied on here spring from the essential function of the Housing Trust in providing accommodation for the homeless and to that end to maintain a stock of housing over which it has maximum control , which a licence rather than a tenancy might be more likely to give . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
228	8	I am , however , satisfied that the judgment of Slade L.J. in Family Association v. Jones -LSB- 1990 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 779 was correct although I share his anxiety about the impact of such a result on the Housing Trust . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
228	9	There were , it follows , in this case no special circumstances to displace the general rule . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
228	10	Accordingly , for the reasons given by Lord Hoffmann , I agree that this appeal could be allowed . 	lord slynn	lord hoffmann	fullagr	0	lord hoffmann
228	10	Accordingly , for the reasons given by Lord Hoffmann , I agree that this appeal could be allowed . 	lord slynn	self	outcome	0	lord hoffmann

228	12	LORD JAUNCEY OF TULLICHETTLE 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
228	13	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
228	14	The respondents are a charitable Housing Trust one of whose purposes is to provide short term accommodation for the homeless . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
228	15	The Trust has the use of a block of flats owned by Lambeth Borough Council pursuant to a license agreement with that council of 27 March 1986 which provided that no grant of an estate or other proprietary interest was thereby conferred and that the subjects should be used to provide temporary accommodation for homeless persons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
228	16	It is not disputed that by reason of section 32 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Housing Act 1985 the council would have had no power to make such a grant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
228	17	The Trust 's use of the subjects was accordingly in the capacity of licensees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
228	18	On 31 January 1989 the Trust entered into an agreement with the appellant which stated that occupation of a flat in the block was being offered to him on a weekly license from 6 February 1989 and that the Trust had the property on license from the council . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
228	19	I need not condescend further on the relevant terms of the agreement which have been fully set out in the speech by my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann . 	lord jauncey	lord hoffmann	partagr	0.1	lord hoffmann
228	20	I do not doubt that both parties to the agreement were under the impression and indeed intended that the legal consequences of the agreement should be those of a license . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
228	21	A not unreasonable intention given that the Trust 's only interest in the subject was that of a licensee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
228	22	However , the issue in this appeal is whether that professed intention was achieved or whether the legal consequences of the agreement amounted to a tenancy bringing into operation section 11 of The Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
228	23	In Street v. Mountford -LSB- 1985 -RSB- A.C. 809 this House decided that where residential accommodation is granted for a term , at a rent with exclusive possession , the Landlord providing neither attention nor services , the grant is a tenancy notwithstanding the fact that the agreement professes an intention by both parties to create a mere licence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
228	24	It is the legal consequences of the agreement which is determinative rather than the label which parties have chosen to attach to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
228	25	In this case the Trust granted exclusive possession to the appellant , a fact which is fortified rather than detracted from by the reservation of rights of access by the Trust and the council for limited purposes -LRB- Street v. Mountford , Lord Templeman at p. 818 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
228	26	Prima facie therefore the agreement constituted a tenancy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
228	27	This notwithstanding the fact that the Trust had only a limited interest in the subjects . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
228	28	However it remains to consider whether notwithstanding the apparent grant of a tenancy there exist special circumstances which are capable of negativing this result -LRB- Street v. Mountford , Lord Templeman at p. 822 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
228	29	Mr. Henderson Q.C. argued that the fact that the Trust was a responsible charitable organisation performing important social functions and that it was merely a licensee of the subjects , inhibited by the terms of that licence from granting tenancies , amounted to such special circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
228	30	My Lords in Family Housing Association v. Jones -LSB- 1990 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 779 , where the facts were very similar to those in this case , the association as licensee of a local authority granted what was described as a licence to the defendant to occupy premises on a temporary basis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
228	31	Following Street v. Mountford -LSB- 1985 -RSB- A.C. 809 , the Court of Appeal held that the agreement constituted a tenancy and Slade L.J. at p. 793 rejected the argument that there existed special circumstances whereby the defendant , albeit in exclusive possession of the premises , was not a tenant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
228	32	In my view Slade L.J 's rejection was correct and his reasoning equally applicable to the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
228	33	In the absence of any exceptional circumstances it follows that the agreement between the Trust and the appellant constituted a tenancy to which section 11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 applied and that the appeal should be allowed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
228	34	I have one further matter to mention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
228	35	In Family Housing Association v. Jones , Slade L.J. at p. 793 observed in relation to the argument as to existence of special circumstances : `` The argument which we have heard suggests to me that , whatever their wishes or intentions , it may at least be difficult for bodies charged with responsibilities for the housing of the homeless to enter into any arrangement pursuant to section 65 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Housing Act 1985 under which the person housed is to enjoy exclusive occupation of premises , however temporarily , without conferring on that person security of tenure by virtue of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
228	36	`` The result must be substantially to reduce the choice of methods available to bodies such as the housing association for dealing with their always limited supplies of housing stock . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
228	37	I am not sure that this result will necessarily inure to the benefit of the class of homeless persons in this country viewed as a whole . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
228	38	These are the reasons for the misgivings expressed at the start of this judgment . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
228	39	In his dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal in this case Sir Brian Neill expressed his regret at his inability to distinguish Family Housing Association v. Jones -LSB- 1990 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 779 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
228	40	Regret , no doubt , stemming from Slade L.J. 's comments on the consequences of his rejection of the special circumstances argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
228	41	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
228	42	I share Slade L.J. 's misgivings for the reasons he states and Sir Brian Neill 's regrets . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
228	43	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
228	44	LORD HOFFMANN 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
228	45	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
228	46	The question in this appeal is whether Mr. Bruton has a tenancy of a flat in Brixton . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
228	47	He occupies the flat under an agreement dated 31 January 1989 with the London and Quadrant Housing Trust -LRB- `` the Trust '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
228	48	The Trust is a charitable housing trust which , among other things , provides short-term accommodation for the homeless and others in need of housing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
228	49	The question arose because Mr. Bruton claims that the Trust is in breach of the implied repairing obligations contained in section 11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
228	50	Section 13 provides that these are to apply to `` a lease of a dwelling house granted on or after October 1961 for a term of less than seven years . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
228	51	Section 36 -LRB- 1 -RRB- provides that `` lease '' and `` tenancy '' are to have the same meaning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
228	52	But the Trust denies that it granted a tenancy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
228	53	It says that the agreement created only a licence to use the flat . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
228	54	When Mr. Bruton brought proceedings in the Lambeth County Court to enforce the implied covenants , it served a notice to quit and claimed a declaration that Mr. Bruton had no statutory security of tenure because he was only a licensee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
228	55	His Honour Judge James directed the trial of a preliminary issue as to whether Mr. Bruton was a tenant or licensee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
228	56	After hearing evidence he declared that he was a licensee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
228	57	The Court of Appeal -LSB- 1998 -RSB- Q.B. 834 -LRB- Kennedy and Millett L.JJ , Sir Brian Neill dissenting -RRB- affirmed his judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
228	58	Mr. Bruton appeals to your Lordships ' House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
228	59	The flat is in a block belonging to the London Borough of Lambeth -LRB- `` the council '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
228	60	It acquired the block in 1975 for housing purposes by the use of compulsory powers contained in provisions which have now been consolidated in Part II -LRB- Provision of Housing Accommodation -RRB- of the Housing Act 1985 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
228	61	The council intended to demolish the block and build new houses or flats on the site . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
228	62	But the scheme was delayed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
228	63	On 27 March 1986 it entered into an agreement with the Trust by which it permitted the Trust to use the premises in furtherance of its charitable housing objects . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
228	64	The agreement was called a Licence and it is agreed that it was not a grant of an estate or other proprietary interest in the premises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
228	65	Section 32 of the Act of 1985 limits the powers of a local authority to dispose of land held for the purposes of Part II of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
228	66	By subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- the local authority may let the land under a secure tenancy to a residential occupier but can not otherwise dispose of any interest without the consent of the Secretary of State . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
228	67	It would therefore have been ultra vires for the council to have granted the Trust any estate or other proprietary interest in the premises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
228	68	The agreement between the Trust and Mr. Bruton read as follows : `` Occupation of Short-Life Accommodation at 2 Oval House , Rushcroft Road , SW2 on a temporary basis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
228	69	`` As has been explained to you , the above property is being offered to you by -LSB- the Trust -RSB- on a weekly Licence from 6 February 1989 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
228	70	The Trust has the property on licence from -LSB- the council -RSB- who acquired the property for development . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
228	71	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
228	72	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
228	73	and pending this development , it is being used to provide temporary housing accommodation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
228	74	It is offered to you on the condition that you will vacate upon receiving reasonable notice from the Trust , which will not normally be less than four weeks . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
228	75	You understand and agree that while you are living in the property , you will allow access at all times during normal working hours to the staff of the Trust , the owners and agents for all purposes connected with the work of the Trust . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
228	76	Conditions were attached , including the following clause by which Mr. Bruton agreed - `` To permit the Trust or its agents , surveyors or consultants to enter the property for the purpose of inspecting the state of repair and cleanliness of the property or any purpose connected at all reasonable hours of the day . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
228	77	In return for the right to occupy the flat , Mr. Bruton agreed to pay # 18 a week . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
228	78	Since then , the development scheme has been abandoned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
228	79	Did this agreement create a `` lease '' or `` tenancy '' within the meaning of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 or any other legislation which refers to a lease or tenancy ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
228	80	The decision of this House in Street v. Mountford -LSB- 1985 -RSB- A.C. 809 is authority for the proposition that a `` lease '' or `` tenancy '' is a contractually binding agreement , not referable to any other relationship between the parties , by which one person gives another the right to exclusive occupation of land for a fixed or renewable period or periods of time , usually in return for a periodic payment in money . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
228	81	An agreement having these characteristics creates a relationship of landlord and tenant to which the common law or statute may then attach various incidents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
228	82	The fact that the parties use language more appropriate to a different kind of agreement , such as a licence , is irrelevant if upon its true construction it has the identifying characteristics of a lease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
228	83	The meaning of the agreement , for example , as to the extent of the possession which it grants , depend upon the intention of the parties , objectively ascertained by reference to the language and relevant background . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
228	84	The decision of your Lordships ' House in Westminster City Council v. Clarke -LSB- 1992 -RSB- A.C. 288 is a good example of the importance of background in deciding whether the agreement grants exclusive possession or not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
228	85	But the classification of the agreement as a lease does not depend upon any intention additional to that expressed in the choice of terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
228	86	It is simply a question of characterising the terms which the parties have agreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
228	87	This is a question of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
228	88	In this case , it seems to me that the agreement , construed against the relevant background , plainly gave Mr. Bruton a right to exclusive possession . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
228	89	There is nothing to suggest that he was to share possession with the Trust , the council or anyone else . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
228	90	The Trust did not retain such control over the premises as was inconsistent with Mr. Bruton having exclusive possession , as was the case in Westminster City Council v. Clarke -LSB- 1992 -RSB- A.C. 288 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
228	91	The only rights which it reserved were for itself and the council to enter at certain times and for limited purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
228	92	As Lord Templeman said in Street v. Mountford -LSB- 1985 -RSB- A.C. 809 , 818 , such an express reservation `` only serves to emphasise the fact that the grantee is entitled to exclusive possession and is a tenant . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
228	93	Nor was there any other relationship between the parties to which Mr. Bruton 's exclusive possession could be referable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
228	94	Mr. Henderson Q.C. , who appeared for the Trust , submitted that there were `` special circumstances '' in this case which enabled one to construe the agreement as a licence despite the presence of all the characteristics identified in Street v. Mountford -LSB- 1985 -RSB- A.C. 809 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
228	95	These circumstances were that the Trust was a responsible landlord performing socially valuable functions , it had agreed with the council not to grant tenancies , Mr. Bruton had agreed that he was not to have a tenancy and the Trust had no estate out of which it could grant one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
228	96	In my opinion none of these circumstances can make an agreement to grant exclusive possession something other than a tenancy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
228	97	The character of the landlord is irrelevant because although the Rent Acts and other Landlord and Tenant Acts do make distinctions between different kinds of landlords , it is not by saying that what would be a tenancy if granted by one landlord will be something else if granted by another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
228	98	The alleged breach of the Trust 's licence is irrelevant because there is no suggestion that the grant of a tenancy would have been ultra vires either the Trust or the council : see section 32 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Housing Act 1985 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
228	99	If it was a breach of a term of the licence from the council , that would have been because it was a tenancy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
228	100	The licence could not have turned it into something else . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
228	101	Mr. Bruton 's agreement is irrelevant because one can not contract out of the statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
228	102	The trust 's lack of title is also irrelevant , but I shall consider this point at a later stage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
228	103	In Family Housing Association v. Jones -LSB- 1990 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 779 , where the facts were very similar to those in the present case , the Court of Appeal construed the `` licence '' as a tenancy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
228	104	Slade L.J. gave careful consideration to whether any exceptional ground existed for making an exception to the principle in Street v. Mountford -LSB- 1985 -RSB- A.C. 809 and came to the conclusion that there was not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
228	105	I respectfully agree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
228	106	For these reasons I consider that the agreement between the Trust and Mr. Bruton was a lease within the meaning of section 11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
228	107	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
228	108	in my opinion , that is the end of the matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
228	109	But the Court of Appeal did not stop at that point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
228	110	In the leading majority judgment , Millett L.J. -LSB- 1998 -RSB- Q.B. 834 , said that an agreement could not be a lease unless it had a further characteristic , namely that it created a legal estate in the land which `` binds the whole world . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
228	111	-LRB- -LSB- 1998 -RSB- Q.B. 834 , 845 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
228	112	If , as in this case , the grantor had no legal estate , the agreement could not create one and therefore did not qualify as a lease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
228	113	The only exception was the case in which the grantor was estopped from denying that he could not create a legal estate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
228	114	In that case , a `` tenancy by estoppel '' came into existence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
228	115	But an estoppel depended upon the grantor having purported to grant a lease and in this case the Trust had not done so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
228	116	It had made it clear that it was only purporting to grant a licence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
228	117	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
228	118	I hope that this summary does justice to the closely reasoned judgment of Millett L.J. . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
228	119	But I fear that I must respectfully differ at three critical steps in the argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
228	120	First , the term `` lease '' or `` tenancy '' describes a relationship between two parties who are designated landlord and tenant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
228	121	It is not concerned with the question of whether the agreement creates an estate or other proprietary interest which may be binding upon third parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
228	122	A lease may , and usually does , create a proprietary interest called a leasehold estate or , technically , a `` term of years absolute . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
228	123	This will depend upon whether the landlord had an interest out of which he could grant it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
228	124	Nemo dat quod non habet . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
228	125	But it is the fact that the agreement is a lease which creates the proprietary interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
228	126	It is putting the cart before the horse to say that whether the agreement is a lease depends upon whether it creates a proprietary interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
228	127	Mr. Henderson relied on a dictum of Denning L.J. in Lewisham Borough Council v. Roberts -LSB- 1949 -RSB- 2 K.B. 608 , where the question was whether the council , exercising delegated requisitioning powers under the Emergency Powers -LRB- Defence -RRB- Act 1939 , was entitled to possession of part of a house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
228	128	Denning L.J. said , at p. 622 : '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
228	129	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
228	130	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
228	131	-LSB- I -RSB- t is necessary to consider the nature of the power to requisition land . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
228	132	It is only a power to take possession of land . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
228	133	It is not a power to acquire any estate or interest in any land . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
228	134	Once possession is taken the Crown can exercise all the powers incident to possession , such as to license other people to use the premises ; but it can not grant a lease or create any legal interest in the land in favour of any other person , because it has itself no estate in the land out of which to carve any interest . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
228	135	It seems to me that Denning L.J. was focusing on the question of whether the Crown could create a legal interest in the land which would be binding upon third parties and said , correctly , that the Crown could not create such an interest without having an estate of its own . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
228	136	It is true that he said the Crown could not `` grant a lease '' and this could be read to mean that the absence of a legal estate prevented the Crown from entering into the relationship of landlord and tenant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
228	137	But I do not think that this is what he had in mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
228	138	In any case , the Crown in that case could not have validly entered into such a relationship because it would have been ultra vires its statutory powers under the Emergency Powers -LRB- Defence -RRB- Act 1939 : see Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries v. Matthews -LSB- 1950 -RSB- 1 K.B. 148 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
228	139	Millett L.J. , at p. 846 distinguished the case of Family Housing Association v. Jones -LSB- 1990 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 779 , where , as I have said , the facts were very similar to those in the present case , on the ground that `` the fact that the grantor had no title was not referred to in argument or the judgments . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
228	140	In my opinion this is easily explained by the fact that the grantor 's title or lack of title was irrelevant to the issue in the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
228	141	Secondly , I think that Millett L.J. may have been misled by the ancient phrase `` tenancy by estoppel '' into thinking that it described an agreement which would not otherwise be a lease or tenancy but which was treated as being one by virtue of an estoppel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
228	142	In fact , as the authorities show , it is not the estoppel which creates the tenancy , but the tenancy which creates the estoppel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
228	143	The estoppel arises when one or other of the parties wants to deny one of the ordinary incidents or obligations of the tenancy on the ground that the landlord had no legal estate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
228	144	The basis of the estoppel is that having entered into an agreement which constitutes a lease or tenancy , he can not repudiate that incident or obligation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
228	145	So in Morton v. Woods -LRB- 1867 -RRB- L.R. 4 Q.B. 292 , a factory owner granted a second mortgage to a bank to secure advances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
228	146	But the mortgagor had no legal estate , having conveyed it to the first mortgagee , and therefore could not confer one upon the second mortgagee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
228	147	As additional security , the borrower `` attorned tenant '' to the second mortgagee , that is to say , acknowledged a relationship of landlord and tenant between them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
228	148	This was a device commonly used in old mortgages to give the mortgagee the rights of a landlord : a speedier procedure for recovery of possession which was then available and the right to levy distress upon goods and chattels on the mortgaged premises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
228	149	-LRB- See Megarry and Wade , The Law of Real Property -LRB- 5th ed . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
228	150	-LRB- 1984 -RRB- p. 946 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
228	151	When the borrower failed to pay , the bank levied a distress . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
228	152	The owner of the goods sued for damages , claiming that the bank had no right to levy distress because that ancient common law remedy was available only to the holder of a legal estate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
228	153	A recital to the mortgage made it plain that the bank was a second mortgagee and therefore had no legal estate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
228	154	The Court of Queen 's Bench held that the mortgagor was estopped from denying the bank 's legal title . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
228	155	Kelly C.B. said , at p. 304 : '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
228	156	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
228	157	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
228	158	it is the creation of the tenancy , or the estoppel , which arises from the creation of the relation of landlord and tenant by agreement between the parties , that makes the actual legal estate unnecessary to support the distress . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
228	159	Thus it is the fact that the agreement between the parties constitutes a tenancy that gives rise to an estoppel and not the other way round . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
228	160	It therefore seems to me that the question of tenancy by estoppel does not arise in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
228	161	The issue is simply whether the agreement is a tenancy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
228	162	It is not whether either party is entitled to deny some obligation or incident of the tenancy on the ground that the Trust had no title . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
228	163	Thirdly , I can not agree that there is no inconsistency between what the Trust purported to do and its denial of the existence of a tenancy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
228	164	This seems to me to fly in the face of Street v. Mountford -LSB- 1985 -RSB- A.C. 809 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
228	165	In my opinion , the Trust plainly did purport to grant a tenancy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
228	166	It entered into an agreement on terms which constituted a tenancy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
228	167	It may have agreed with Mr. Bruton to say that it was not a tenancy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
228	168	But the parties can not contract out of the Rent Acts or other landlord and tenant statutes by such devices . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
228	169	Nor in my view can they be used by a landlord to avoid being estopped from denying that he entered into the agreement he actually made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
228	170	For these reasons I would allow the appeal and declare that Mr. Bruton was a tenant . 	lord hoffmann	self	outcome	0.8	lord hoffmann
228	171	I should add that I express no view on whether he was a secure tenant or on the rights of the council to recover possession of the flat . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann

228	179	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
228	180	I agree that this appeal should be allowed as proposed by my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann and for the reasons which he has given . 	lord hobhouse	self	outcome	0.8	lord hoffmann
228	180	I agree that this appeal should be allowed as proposed by my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann and for the reasons which he has given . 	lord hobhouse	lord hoffmann	outcome	0.8	lord hoffmann

228	181	I would add only this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
228	182	The claim made in the action seeks to enforce a contractual cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
228	183	The breach of contract alleged against the defendant Housing Trust is the failure to maintain and keep in repair the flat in which the plaintiff , Mr Bruton is living . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
228	184	He relies upon a written agreement between himself and the Housing Trust dated 31 January 1989 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
228	185	The written agreement does not contain any undertaking by the Housing Trust to repair the flat . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
228	186	But Mr Bruton alleges that the agreement creates a relationship of landlord and tenant between the Housing Trust and himself and that therefore an undertaking to repair by the Housing Trust is compulsorily implied by statute - section 11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
228	187	Counsel for the Housing Trust accepted before your Lordships that a contractual relationship of landlord and tenant suffices to make the provisions of the Act applicable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
228	188	The question therefore is whether the agreement creates such a relationship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
228	189	The answer to this question is , in my judgment , determined by the decision in Street v. Mountford -LSB- 1985 -RSB- A.C. 809 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
228	190	The agreement was an agreement to give Mr Bruton the exclusive possession of the flat for a period or periods of time in return for the periodic payment of money ; the grant of exclusive possession was not referable to any other relationship between the parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
228	191	It follows that the relationship created was that of landlord and tenant and the provisions of the Act apply to the agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
228	192	Mr Bruton is entitled to succeed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
228	193	The relevant question is simply one of ascertaining the effect in law of the agreement which the parties made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
228	194	It is true that before the court construes an agreement it must inform itself of the surrounding circumstances existing at the time that the contract was made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
228	195	-LRB- Reardon Smith v. Hansen-Tangen -LSB- 1976 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 989 -RRB- This rule applies as much to contracts relating to property as much as to any other contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
228	196	In the present case , it is correct that both parties knew that the Housing Trust was a mere licensee of the Council and , in so far as they may have thought about it , should have realised that for the Housing Trust to grant Mr Bruton the exclusive possession of the flat probably amounted to a breach of the Housing Trust 's obligations to the Council . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
228	197	But this can not contradict what was actually agreed between the Housing Trust and Mr Bruton or its legal effect as between them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
228	198	-LRB- Family Housing Association v. Jones -LSB- 1990 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 779 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
228	199	It would be different if it could be shown that the Housing Trust had no capacity to make the agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
228	200	-LRB- Minister of Agriculture v. Matthews -LSB- 1950 -RSB- 1 K.B. 148 -RRB- Lack of capacity renders an apparent agreement without legal effect ; this is an application of the ordinary principles of the law of contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
228	201	But the present case is not such a case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
228	202	The Housing Trust had the requisite capacity to make the agreement with Mr Bruton -LRB- as for that matter had the Council -- section 44 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Housing Act 1985 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
228	203	The Court of Appeal were influenced by the way in which the case for Mr Bruton was argued before them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
228	204	They understood that his case depended upon establishing a tenancy by estoppel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
228	205	This was not a correct analysis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
228	206	He needed to do no more than rely upon the written agreement he had with the Housing Trust and its legal effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
228	207	The only concept of estoppel which was possibly relevant was that which arises from the agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
228	208	The estoppel is of the same character as that which estops a bailee from disputing the title of his bailor or the licensee of a patent from disputing the validity of the patent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
228	209	The estoppels are mutual ; they bind both of the parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
228	210	Where the relationship is contractual , as in the present case , the estoppel arises from the agreement not the other way round . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
228	211	The present case does not depend upon the establishing of an estoppel nor does any problem arise from the fact that the Housing Trust did not have a legal estate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
228	212	The case of Mr Bruton depends upon his establishing that his agreement with the Housing Trust has the legal effect of creating a relationship of tenant and landlord between them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
228	213	That is all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
228	214	It does not depend upon his establishing a proprietary title good against all the world or against the Council . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
228	215	It is not necessary for him to show that the Council had conveyed a legal estate to the Housing Trust . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
228	216	I therefore can not agree with the reasoning of the Court of Appeal and would allow this appeal . 	lord hobhouse	self	outcome	1	lord hoffmann
