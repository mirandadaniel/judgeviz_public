121	1	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	2	LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	4	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	5	On 29 July 2004 , the Appellate Committee announced that this appeal should be allowed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	6	I now give my reasons for reaching that decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	7	Introduction 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	8	The actual issue for decision on this appeal is an apparently simple one that can be very shortly stated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	9	Do the communications between the Bank of England , their solicitors , Freshfields , and counsel relating to the content and preparation of the so-called overarching statement submitted on behalf of the Bank to the Bingham Inquiry qualify for legal professional privilege ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	10	It is contended by the respondents , and was held by the Court of Appeal , that they do not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	11	But the broader issues that have been debated on this appeal are not in the least simple . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	12	They have required your Lordships to consider the policy justifications for the existence of legal professional privilege in our law and , generally , the permissible scope of the privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	13	In relation to what sort of communications can legal professional privilege be claimed ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	14	As to the scope of legal professional privilege , the focus has been , first , on the part , if any , that legal professional privilege should be allowed to play where the advice or assistance sought by the lawyers is not advice or assistance about the client 's legal rights or obligations , and , second , on the criteria to be applied to determine whether communications between the lawyers and employees of the client can be treated for privilege purposes as communications between the lawyers and the client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	15	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	16	In order that the significance of the issues as I have broadly described them can be understood , it is necessary to provide a brief history of the events that have led up to this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	17	The history 4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	18	The starting point is the collapse of BCCI in July 1991 with a huge excess of liabilities over assets . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	19	BCCI 's depositors stood to lose a substantial part of their deposits . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	20	Shareholders in BCCI stood to lose their investments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	21	Under the Banking Acts of 1979 and 1987 the Bank of England -LRB- `` the Bank '' -RRB- has a supervisory role in relation to banks and financial institutions carrying on business in the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	22	So the Bank had had statutory responsibilities and duties regarding the supervision of BCCI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	23	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	24	Very shortly after the collapse of BCCI the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in Parliament that there would be an independent inquiry into the Bank 's supervision of BCCI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	25	Bingham LJ -LRB- as he then was -RRB- was appointed to conduct the Inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	26	Bingham LJ 's terms of reference required him `` To enquire into the supervision of BCCI under the Banking Acts ; to consider whether the action taken by all the UK authorities was appropriate and timely ; and to make recommendations . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	27	In a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer written in July 1992 , Bingham LJ described his terms of reference as calling for the consideration of five broad questions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	28	These were - '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- What did the United Kingdom authorities know about BCCI at all relevant times ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	29	-LRB- 2 -RRB- Should they have known more ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	30	-LRB- 3 -RRB- What action did the United Kingdom authorities take in relation to BCCI at all relevant times ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	31	-LRB- 4 -RRB- Should they have acted differently ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	32	-LRB- 5 -RRB- What should be done to prevent or minimise the risk of such an event recurring in the future ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	33	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	34	It was clear to all that the Bank was the principal party to be investigated and shortly after the Inquiry had been established the Governor of the Bank appointed three Bank officials to deal with all communications between the Bank and the Inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	35	These officials , and other Bank personnel appointed to assist them from time to time , became known as the Bank 's Bingham Inquiry Unit -LRB- `` the BIU '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	36	Freshfields were retained by the Bank to advise generally on all dealings of the Bank , its officials and employees with the Inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	37	Freshfields retained counsel to assist in that process . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	38	One of the main functions of the BIU was the preparation and communication of information and instructions to Freshfields to enable them to carry out their duties under their retainer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	39	They -LRB- Freshfields -RRB- and counsel gave advice as to the preparation and presentation of the Bank 's evidence to the Inquiry and as to the submissions to be made to the Inquiry on the Bank 's behalf . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	40	Indeed , except for some routine administrative arrangements , all the Bank 's communications with the Inquiry were the subject of extensive advice from Freshfields and counsel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	41	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	42	The Bingham Inquiry Report was published on 22 October 1992 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	43	In 1993 some 6,231 persons , each of whom claimed to be a depositor with United Kingdom branches of BCCI , and BCCI itself -LRB- by its liquidators -RRB- commenced an action against the Bank for the loss they had respectively been caused by the BCCI collapse . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	44	Section 1 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the Banking Act 1987 relieves the Bank of any liability `` for anything done or omitted in the discharge or purported discharge of the functions of the Bank under this Act unless it is shown that the act or omission was in bad faith '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	45	It was , therefore , not possible for the action to be based merely on an alleged negligent performance by the Bank of its supervisory duties vis-Ã -vis BCCI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	46	The various acts or omissions on the part of the Bank to which the collapse of BCCI was alleged to be attributable had to be `` in bad faith '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	47	This requirement plainly placed before the claimants in the action -LRB- the respondents before your Lordships -RRB- a very high hurdle and it is not in the least surprising that they have been , and still are , seeking the widest possible discovery from the Bank in order to assist their efforts to jump it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	48	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	49	By an application notice dated 25 October 2002 the claimants sought disclosure by the Bank of a large number of documents which the Bank claimed it had the right to withhold on the ground of legal professional privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	50	These were documents which had been brought into existence by employees of the Bank for the purpose of being passed to Freshfields . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	51	The parties were agreed that documents emanating from or prepared by independent third parties and then passed to Freshfields were not privileged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	52	It was the status of documents prepared by Bank employees that was in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	53	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	54	Tomlinson J in his judgment of 13 December 2002 -LRB- Three Rivers District Council v Governor and Company of the Bank of England -LRB- No. 5 -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- EWHC 2730 -RRB- held that all these documents were privileged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	55	In paragraph 10 of his judgment , he described the documents as `` generated for the purpose of providing information to the Bank 's legal advisers to enable them to prepare submissions and/or to advise on the nature , presentation , timing and/or content of the Bank 's submissions to , evidence for and responses to requests from the Inquiry '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	56	And he proceeded to consider the privilege issue `` upon the assumption that the material which the Bank seeks to protect from disclosure is both relevant to and probative as to the issues in the trial '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	57	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	58	The modern case law on legal professional privilege has divided the privilege into two categories , legal advice privilege and litigation privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	59	Litigation privilege covers all documents brought into being for the purposes of litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	60	Legal advice privilege covers communications between lawyers and their clients whereby legal advice is sought or given . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	61	In in re L -LSB- 1997 -RSB- AC 16 Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle described litigation privilege as `` essentially a creature of adversarial proceedings '' and held that the privilege could not be claimed in order to protect from disclosure a report prepared for use in non-adversarial proceedings -LRB- see p. 26 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	62	Lord Lloyd of Berwick and Lord Steyn expressed their agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	63	The Bingham Inquiry could not have been described as adversarial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	64	It was , as inquiries invariably are , an inquisitorial proceeding . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	65	It was no doubt with in re L in mind that the Bank did not claim that the documents of which disclosure was being sought were entitled to litigation privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	66	The Bank took its stand on legal advice privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	67	As to that , the Bank claimed privilege for all documents prepared for at least the dominant purpose of obtaining or recording legal advice from Freshfields or counsel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	68	In paragraph 30 of his judgment Tomlinson J accepted this claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	69	He said - `` In my judgment an internal confidential document , not being a communication with a third party , which was produced or brought into existence with the dominant purpose that it or its contents be used to obtain legal advice is privileged from production . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	70	He therefore dismissed the 25 October 2002 discovery application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	71	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	72	In an addendum to his judgment given on 6 February 2003 after a further hearing Tomlinson J dealt with the question whether documents prepared by ex-employees or ex-officers of BCCI stood on the same footing for legal advice privilege purposes as documents prepared by current employees or current officers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	73	He held that provided the dominant purpose test that he had formulated in his main judgment were satisfied , no distinction for privilege purposes was to be drawn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	74	He said , in paragraph 6 - `` In my judgment the former officers of the Bank who were concerned with the supervision of BCCI and who in that capacity acquired relevant knowledge which was confidential to the Bank are not for this purpose to be regarded as third parties '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	75	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	76	The BCCI claimants appealed and on 3 April 2003 the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	77	It is important to notice that Mr Gordon Pollock QC , counsel for the claimants , did not argue for disclosure of documents passing between the BIU and Freshfields nor for disclosure of any of Freshfields ' internal memoranda or drafts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	78	Mr Pollock accepted that the BIU was , for the purpose of the Inquiry , Freshfields ' client and that communications passing between them were covered by legal advice privilege -LRB- see para .4 of the judgment handed down by Longmore LJ : Three Rivers District Council v Governor and Company of the Bank of England -LRB- No. 5 -RRB- -LSB- 2003 -RSB- QB 1556 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	79	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	80	The Court of Appeal judgment -LRB- Three Rivers -LRB- No. 5 -RRB- succinctly summed up the rival submissions - `` 5 ... Mr Pollock submitted that it was only communications between solicitor and client , and evidence of the content of such communications , that were privileged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	81	Preparatory materials obtained before such communications , even if prepared for the dominant purpose of being shown to a client 's solicitor , even if prepared at the solicitor 's request and even if subsequently sent to the solicitor , did not come within the privilege . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	82	`` 6 Mr Stadlen , for the Bank , submitted that , as a matter of general principle , any document prepared with the dominant purpose of obtaining the solicitor 's advice upon it came within the ambit of the privilege , whether or not it was actually communicated to the solicitor ... This general principle was subject to the exception that documents sent to or by an independent third party -LRB- even if created with the dominant purpose of obtaining a solicitor 's advice -RRB- would not be covered by legal advice privilege '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	83	The Court of Appeal accepted Mr Pollock 's submission and held that the only documents for which legal professional privilege could be claimed were communications between the BIU and Freshfields seeking or giving legal advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	84	The BIU , and no one else , was to be treated as Freshfields ' client for privilege purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	85	And in paragraph 37 of the judgment the Court of Appeal expressed the view that material prepared `` for the dominant purpose of putting relevant factual material before the inquiry in an orderly and attractive fashion '' was not prepared `` for the dominant purpose of taking legal advice upon such material '' and so could not attract legal professional privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	86	The former purpose has , for convenience , been referred to as a `` presentational '' purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	87	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	88	As to the question of who , for privilege purposes , was to be regarded as Freshfields ' client , the Court of Appeal said that information provided to solicitors by an employee stood in the same position as information provided by an independent third party -LRB- see -LSB- 2003 -RSB- QB at 1574 G/H -RRB- and , specifically , when considering whether information provided to Freshfields by the Governor of the Bank would have qualified for privilege , that `` the BIU ... is ... the client rather than any single officer however eminent he or she may be '' -LRB- -LSB- 2003 -RSB- QB at 1581 A/B -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	89	In allowing the appeal the Court of Appeal made a declaration that '' ... the only documents or parts of documents coming into the Bank 's possession between the closure of BCCI on 5th July 1991 and the issue of the present proceedings in May 1993 which the Bank is entitled to withhold from inspection on the ground of legal advice privilege are : 1 -RRB- communications passing between the Bank and its legal advisers -LRB- including any solicitor seconded to the Bank -RRB- for the purposes of seeking or obtaining ` legal advice ' ; 2 -RRB- any part of a document which evidences the substance of such a communication . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	90	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	91	The Bank 's petition to this House for leave to appeal against the Court of Appeal 's order was dismissed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	92	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	93	After the dismissal of the Bank 's petition for leave to appeal the Bank began the task of disclosing documents whose disclosure was required under the Court of Appeal order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	94	But the Bank disclosed none of the communications between the BIU and Freshfields or drafts of or internal memoranda relating to the overarching statement that had been submitted on behalf of the Bank to the Inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	95	These were withheld by the Bank from disclosure for two reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	96	First , Mr Pollock had told the Court of Appeal that his clients were not seeking disclosure of any communications between the BIU and Freshfields ; secondly , the Bank contended that the expression `` legal advice '' in the Court of Appeal 's declaration should be interpreted widely so as to cover all advice and assistance from Freshfields or counsel relating to the evidence to be submitted and the submissions to be made to the Inquiry on behalf of the Bank ie . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	97	so as to cover advice given for presentational purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	98	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	99	The impasse regarding these documents led to a further discovery application by the claimants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	100	The application was made on 1 August 2003 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	101	It sought `` further documents from or relating to the Bingham Inquiry Unit arising from the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 3 April 2003 '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	102	Tomlinson J gave judgment on the application on 4 November 2003 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	103	He held that the rationale of the Court of Appeal judgment overturning his own previous decision was that Freshfields ' advice sought or given for presentational purposes should not in general be categorised as legal advice of the sort which attracted legal advice privilege -LRB- see para .13 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	104	If , however , the dominant purpose of some particular communication between the BIU and Freshfields was the provision of advice as to the Bank 's legal rights and obligations , as opposed to the question of how the Bank 's evidence might be presented to the Inquiry so as to be least likely to attract criticism , then that communication , or the relevant part of it , would be entitled to privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	105	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	106	So Tomlinson J made an order dated 10 November 2003 declaring that the only documents or parts of documents that the Bank was entitled to withhold from disclosure on the ground of legal advice privilege were communications passing between the BIU and its lawyers for the purpose of seeking or obtaining `` advice concerning the Bank 's rights and obligations '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	107	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	108	The Bank appealed and on 1 March 2004 the Master of the Rolls , Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers , handed down the judgment of the Court of Appeal dismissing the appeal -LRB- Three Rivers District Council v Governor and Company of the Bank of England -LRB- No. 6 -RRB- -LSB- 2004 -RSB- QB 916 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	109	The judgment -LRB- Three Rivers -LRB- No. 6 -RRB- -RRB- made clear the view of the Court of Appeal that for legal advice privilege purposes the advice being sought from the lawyers must be advice as to legal rights or liabilities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	110	Advice as to how the Bank should present its case to the Inquiry so as to lead to a conclusion as favourable to the Bank as possible did not qualify for privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	111	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	112	The Bank has now appealed to your Lordships . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	113	It is important to emphasise the narrowness of the actual issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	114	It is whether the communications between the BIU and Freshfields or counsel relating to the Inquiry are protected by legal advice privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	115	The Bank plainly believe that the Court of Appeal order in Three Rivers -LRB- No. 5 -RRB- went too far . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	116	But the Bank 's petition for leave to appeal was refused and this is not an appeal against that order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	117	Moreover the Bank has discharged the disclosure obligation required by that order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	118	However , the narrow scope allowed by the Court of Appeal in the judgment now under appeal to `` legal advice '' has heightened the concerns of many about the approach to legal advice privilege inherent in the first Court of Appeal judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	119	This explains in part the applications for leave to intervene in this appeal made by the Attorney-General , by the Law Society and by the Bar Council . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	120	Each has been given leave to intervene by written submissions , including leave , if so advised , to submit a written reply at the conclusion of the oral hearing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	121	Their Lordships are grateful for the written submissions they have received from the interveners . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	122	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	123	The written submissions from the interveners , and particularly that from the Law Society , make clear their concern that the Three Rivers -LRB- No. 5 -RRB- Court of Appeal judgment may have gone too far in treating communications between Freshfields and employees of the Bank , other than the BIU , as being for privilege purposes communications between Freshfields and third parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	124	Your Lordships have been invited to clarify the approach that should be adopted to determine whether a communication between an employee and his or her employer 's lawyers should be treated for legal advice privilege purposes as a communication between the lawyers and their client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	125	This is of particular importance for corporate clients , who can only communicate through employees or officers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	126	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	127	The employee/client point does not , however , arise as an issue on this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	128	It did arise on the Three Rivers -LRB- No. 5 -RRB- discovery application , and the Court of Appeal 's view that only communications between the lawyers and the BIU could be regarded as communications qualifying for legal advice privilege was the basis on which disclosure by the Bank pursuant to the Court of Appeal order of 3 April 2003 has taken place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	129	The disclosed documents have included communications between the Bank 's lawyers and those Bank employees and officers who were not members of the BIU . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	130	Since then , and well before the hearing of this appeal , the hearing of the action before Tomlinson J commenced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	131	Mr Pollock opened his case on the basis , inter alia , of the documents disclosed pursuant to the 3 April 2003 order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	132	He expressed before your Lordships on this appeal a natural concern that if your Lordships gave any ruling indicating that some of the disclosed documents ought to have been held to be privileged , serious complications affecting the trial might arise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	133	However Mr Sumption QC , on behalf of the Bank , gave the Bank 's undertaking that reliance by the claimants on the documents already disclosed would not , whatever view your Lordships might express on the employer/client point , be resisted on privilege grounds , and that it would not be suggested that Tomlinson J 's knowledge and sight of the contents of those documents constituted any reason why he should recuse himself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	134	The point is , therefore , so far as the current litigation between the claimants and the Bank is concerned , strictly moot . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	135	Nothing turns on it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	136	Nonetheless your Lordships have been asked to express on a view on the point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	137	I will return to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	138	Policy 23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	139	It is impossible to express a coherent view about the issues which have been debated on this appeal without taking into account the policy reasons which led to legal advice privilege becoming established in our law in the first place and to the policy reasons for its retention in our law today . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	140	Before examining those reasons , however , it seems to me helpful to review some of the features of legal advice privilege in order to provide a context for the policy reasons underlying the privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	141	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	142	First , legal advice privilege arises out of a relationship of confidence between lawyer and client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	143	Unless the communication or document for which privilege is sought is a confidential one , there can be no question of legal advice privilege arising . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	144	The confidential character of the communication or document is not by itself enough to enable privilege to be claimed but is an essential requirement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	145	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	146	Second , if a communication or document qualifies for legal professional privilege , the privilege is absolute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	147	It can not be overridden by some supposedly greater public interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	148	It can be waived by the person , the client , entitled to it and it can be overridden by statute -LRB- c/f R -LRB- Morgan Grenfell Ltd -RRB- v Special Commissioner of Income Tax -LSB- 2003 -RSB- 1 AC 563 -RRB- , but it is otherwise absolute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	149	There is no balancing exercise that has to be carried out -LRB- see B v Auckland District Law Society -LSB- 2003 -RSB- 2 AC 736 paras .46 to 54 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	150	The Supreme Court of Canada has held that legal professional privilege although of great importance is not absolute and can be set aside if a sufficiently compelling public interest for doing so , such as public safety , can be shown -LRB- see Jones v Smith -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 1 SCR 455 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	151	But no other common law jurisdiction has , so far as I am aware , developed the law of privilege in this way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	152	Certainly in this country legal professional privilege , if it is attracted by a particular communication between lawyer and client or attaches to a particular document , can not be set aside on the ground that some other higher public interest requires that to be done . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	153	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	154	Third , legal advice privilege gives the person entitled to it the right to decline to disclose or to allow to be disclosed the confidential communication or document in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	155	There has been some debate as to whether this right is a procedural right or a substantive right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	156	In my respectful opinion the debate is sterile . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	157	Legal advice privilege is both . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	158	It may be used in legal proceedings to justify the refusal to answer certain questions or to produce for inspection certain documents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	159	Its characterisation as procedural or substantive neither adds to nor detracts from its features . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	160	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	161	Fourth , legal advice privilege has an undoubted relationship with litigation privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	162	Legal advice is frequently sought or given in connection with current or contemplated litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	163	But it may equally well be sought or given in circumstances and for purposes that have nothing to do with litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	164	If it is sought or given in connection with litigation , then the advice would fall into both of the two categories . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	165	But it is long settled that a connection with litigation is not a necessary condition for privilege to be attracted -LRB- see eg . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	166	Greenough v Gaskell -LRB- 1833 -RRB- 1 My & K 98 per Lord Brougham at 102/3 and Minet v Morgan -LRB- 1873 -RRB- 8 Ch . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	167	App . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	168	361 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	169	On the other hand it has been held that litigation privilege can extend to communications between a lawyer or the lawyer 's client and a third party or to any document brought into existence for the dominant purpose of being used in litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	170	The connection between legal advice sought or given and the affording of privilege to the communication has thereby been cut . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	171	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	172	So I must now come to policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	173	Why is it that the law has afforded this special privilege to communications between lawyers and their clients that it has denied to all other confidential communications ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	174	In relation to all other confidential communications , whether between doctor and patient , accountant and client , husband and wife , parent and child , priest and penitent , the common law recognises the confidentiality of the communication , will protect the confidentiality up to a point , but declines to allow the communication the absolute protection allowed to communications between lawyer and client giving or seeking legal advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	175	In relation to all these other confidential communications the law requires the public interest in the preservation of confidences and the private interest of the parties in maintaining the confidentiality of their communications to be balanced against the administration of justice reasons for requiring disclosure of the confidential material . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	176	There is a strong public interest that in criminal cases the innocent should be acquitted and the guilty convicted , that in civil cases the claimant should succeed if he is entitled to do so and should fail if he is not , that every trial should be a fair trial and that to provide the best chance of these desiderata being achieved all relevant material should be available to be taken into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	177	These are the administration of justice reasons to be placed in the balance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	178	They will usually prevail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	179	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	180	In paragraph 39 of their judgment in Three Rivers -LRB- No. 6 -RRB- the Court of Appeal commented that `` The justification for litigation privilege is readily understood . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	181	Where , however , litigation is not anticipated it is not easy to see why communications with a solicitor should be privileged '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	182	As to the justification for litigation privilege , I would respectfully agree that the need to afford privilege to the seeking or giving of legal advice for the purposes of actual or contemplated litigation is easy to understand . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	183	I do not , however , agree that that is so in relation to those documents or communications which although having the requisite connection with litigation neither constitute nor disclose the seeking or giving of legal advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	184	Communications between litigant and third parties are the obvious example . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	185	This House in in re L -LSB- 1997 -RSB- AC 16 restricted litigation privilege to communications or documents with the requisite connection to adversarial proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	186	Civil litigation conducted pursuant to the current Civil Procedure Rules is in many respects no longer adversarial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	187	The decision in in re L warrants , in my opinion , a new look at the justification for litigation privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	188	But that is for another day . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	189	It does not arise on this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	190	The second sentence of the cited passage does , however , pose a question of great relevance to this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	191	It questions the justification for legal advice privilege where the legal advice has no connection with adversarial litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	192	A number of cases in our own jurisdiction and in other common law jurisdictions have sought to answer the question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	193	In R v Derby Magistrates ' Court Ex parte B -LSB- 1996 -RSB- 1 AC 487 Lord Taylor of Gosforth CJ said this - `` In Balabel v Air India -LSB- 1988 -RSB- Ch . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	194	317 the basic principle justifying legal professional privilege was again said to be that a client should be able to obtain legal advice in confidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	195	The principle which runs through all these cases ... is that a man must be able to consult his lawyer in confidence , since otherwise he might hold back half the truth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	196	The client must be sure that what he tells his lawyer in confidence will never be revealed without his consent -LRB- p. 507 -RRB- '' and at p. 508 , that '' ... once any exception to the general rule is allowed , the client 's confidence is necessarily lost '' .

121	197	In R -LRB- Morgan Grenfell Ltd -RRB- v Special Commissioner of Income Tax -LSB- 2003 -RSB- 1 AC 563 Lord Hoffmann referred to legal professional privilege as `` a necessary corollary of the right of any person to obtain skilled advice about the law '' and continued -LRB- p. 607 -RRB- - `` Such advice can not be effectively obtained unless the client is able to put all the facts before the adviser without fear that they may afterwards be disclosed and used to his prejudice . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	198	And in B v Auckland District Law Society -LSB- 2003 -RSB- 2 AC 736 at 757 Lord Millett justified legal professional privilege on the ground that '' ... a lawyer must be able to give his client an absolute and unqualified assurance that whatever the client tells him in confidence will never be disclosed without his consent .

121	199	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	200	In the courts of foreign common law jurisdictions similar views have been expressed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	201	In Upjohn Co. v United States -LRB- 1981 -RRB- 449 US 383 , a decision of the US Supreme Court , Justice Rehnquist said , at p. 389 , that the purpose of legal professional privilege was '' ... to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	202	He went on - `` The privilege recognises that sound legal advice or advocacy serves public ends and that such advice or advocacy depends upon the lawyer being fully informed by the client . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	203	In Jones v Smith -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 1 SCR 455 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada , the privilege was justified on the ground that - `` Clients seeking advice must be able to speak freely to their lawyers secure in the knowledge that what they say will not be divulged without their consent .

121	209	In leading cases in Australia and New Zealand the justification for a rule affording particular protection to confidential communications between lawyers and clients has been expressed on a broader policy basis than merely the need to ensure candour .

121	210	In Baker v Campbell -LRB- 1983 -RRB- 153 CLR 52 , a decision of the High Court of Australia , Murphy J commented that `` The client 's legal privilege is essential for the orderly and dignified conduct of individual affairs in a social atmosphere which is being poisoned by official and unofficial eavesdropping and other invasions of privacy '' -LRB- p. 89 -RRB- and Wilson J , at p. 95 , said `` In fostering the confidential relationship in which legal advice is given and received the common law is serving the ends of justice because it is facilitating the orderly arrangement of the client 's affairs as a member of the community .

121	213	I would refer finally to the justification for legal professional privilege given by Advocate-General Slynn -LRB- as he then was -RRB- in A M & S Europe Ltd v European Commission -LSB- 1983 -RSB- QB 878 at 913 , a passage cited by Kirby J in Daniels Corp v ACCC -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 192 ALR 561 .

121	214	The Advocate-General said this - '' -LSB- The privilege -RSB- springs essentially from the basic need of a man in a civilised society to be able to turn to his lawyer for advice and help , and if proceedings begin , for representation ; it springs no less from the advantages to a society which evolves complex law reaching into all the business affairs of persons , real and legal , that they should be able to know what they can do under the law , what is forbidden , where they must tread circumspectly , where they run risks . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	215	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	216	None of these judicial dicta tie the justification for legal advice privilege to the conduct of litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	217	They recognise that in the complex world in which we live there are a multitude of reasons why individuals , whether humble or powerful , or corporations , whether large or small , may need to seek the advice or assistance of lawyers in connection with their affairs ; they recognise that the seeking and giving of this advice so that the clients may achieve an orderly arrangement of their affairs is strongly in the public interest ; they recognise that in order for the advice to bring about that desirable result it is essential that the full and complete facts are placed before the lawyers who are to give it ; and they recognise that unless the clients can be assured that what they tell their lawyers will not be disclosed by the lawyers without their -LRB- the clients ' -RRB- consent , there will be cases in which the requisite candour will be absent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	218	It is obviously true that in very many cases clients would have no inhibitions in providing their lawyers with all the facts and information the lawyers might need whether or not there were the absolute assurance of non-disclosure that the present law of privilege provides . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	219	But the dicta to which I have referred all have in common the idea that it is necessary in our society , a society in which the restraining and controlling framework is built upon a belief in the rule of law , that communications between clients and lawyers , whereby the clients are hoping for the assistance of the lawyers ' legal skills in the management of their -LRB- the clients ' -RRB- affairs , should be secure against the possibility of any scrutiny from others , whether the police , the executive , business competitors , inquisitive busy-bodies or anyone else -LRB- see also paras .

121	221	I , for my part , subscribe to this idea . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	222	It justifies , in my opinion , the retention of legal advice privilege in our law , notwithstanding that as a result cases may sometimes have to be decided in ignorance of relevant probative material . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	223	The scope of legal advice privilege 35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	224	Legal advice privilege should , in my opinion , be given a scope that reflects the policy reasons that justify its presence in our law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott

121	226	The Court of Appeal has restricted the scope of legal advice privilege to material constituting or recording communications between clients and lawyers seeking or giving advice about the clients ' legal rights and obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	227	It has excluded legal advice sought or given for presentational purposes -LRB- see para . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott

121	229	The particular issue to be decided under the disclosure application of 1 August 2003 was whether advice that related to the presentation of material to the Inquiry qualified for legal advice privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	230	In holding that it did not , the Court of Appeal distinguished between a lawyer-client relationship `` formed for the purpose of obtaining advice or assistance in relation to rights and liabilities '' and a lawyer-client relationship where `` the dominant purpose is not the obtaining of advice and assistance in relation to legal rights and obligations '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	231	In relation to the former , `` broad protection will be given to communications passing between solicitor and client in the course of that relationship '' ; in relation to the latter , a similar broad protection could not be claimed -LRB- see paragraph 26 of the judgment -RRB- .

NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	235	It is clear , however , that whatever view may be taken of the presentational advice point , legal advice privilege must cover also advice and assistance in relation to public law rights , liabilities and obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott

121	239	One of the main purposes of the Inquiry was to examine whether in relation to BCCI the Bank had properly discharged its public law duties of supervision imposed by the Banking Acts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	240	The Bank was naturally anxious that the Inquiry 's conclusions should be as favourable as possible or , to put the point in reverse , that the Inquiry 's criticisms of the Bank should be as limited as possible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott

121	242	The inquiry 's procedures may be judicially reviewed if they are perceived to be unfair . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott

121	244	Presentational advice or assistance given by lawyers to parties whose conduct may be the subject of criticism by the inquiry is advice or assistance that may serve to avoid the need to invoke public law remedies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	245	It would be - or should be - readily accepted that , once an inquiry 's conclusions have been reached and communicated to the sponsors of the inquiry , advice from lawyers to someone criticised as to whether a public law remedy might be available to quash the critical conclusions would be advice that qualified for legal advice privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	246	It makes no sense at all , in my opinion , to withhold the protection of that privilege from presentational advice given by the lawyers for the purpose of preventing that criticism from being made in the first place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott

121	251	legal advice is not confined to telling the client the law ; it must include advice as to what should prudently and sensibly be done in the relevant legal context '' -LRB- p 330 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	252	I would venture to draw attention to Taylor LJ 's reference to `` the relevant legal context '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	253	That there must be a `` relevant legal context '' in order for the advice to attract legal professional privilege should not be in doubt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	254	Taylor LJ said at p 331 that - '' ... to extend privilege without limit to all solicitor and client communication upon matters within the ordinary business of a solicitor and referable to that relationship -LSB- would be -RSB- too wide . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	255	This remark is , in my respectful opinion , plainly correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	256	If a solicitor becomes the client 's `` man of business '' , and some solicitors do , responsible for advising the client on all matters of business , including investment policy , finance policy and other business matters , the advice may lack a relevant legal context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	257	There is , in my opinion , no way of avoiding difficulty in deciding in marginal cases whether the seeking of advice from or the giving of advice by lawyers does or does not take place in a relevant legal context so as to attract legal advice privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	258	In cases of doubt the judge called upon to make the decision should ask whether the advice relates to the rights , liabilities , obligations or remedies of the client either under private law or under public law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	259	If it does not , then , in my opinion , legal advice privilege would not apply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	260	If it does so relate then , in my opinion , the judge should ask himself whether the communication falls within the policy underlying the justification for legal advice privilege in our law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	261	Is the occasion on which the communication takes place and is the purpose for which it takes place such as to make it reasonable to expect the privilege to apply ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	262	The criterion must , in my opinion , be an objective one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	263	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	264	In the discussion of the issue before your Lordships , and in the very helpful written submissions that the parties and the interveners have placed before your Lordships , a number of examples have been given of advice from lawyers in areas where it was suggested to be questionable whether legal advice privilege would be attracted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	265	Planning inquiries were mentioned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	266	Mr Pollock , as I understand it , contended that advice given by lawyers to an objector at a planning inquiry would not qualify for the privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	267	The objector 's rights , liabilities and obligations would not be in issue - so , no privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	268	That plainly could not be said of advice given to the developer seeking the planning permission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	269	Advice to the developer would relate directly to the rights under planning law that the developer hoped to acquire and to any conditions accompanying the permission to develop with which the developer would be under an obligation to comply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	270	But how could it be right to allow privilege to protect advice given to the developer but to deny it to comparable advice given to the objector ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	271	Every objector has the right under public law to present his case to the inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	272	So , in my opinion , advice given by lawyers to objectors for the purpose of enhancing the prospects of a successful outcome , from their point of view , to the inquiry would be advice given in a relevant legal context and would qualify for legal advice privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	273	So to hold would not be to extend litigation privilege to inquiries . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott

121	276	Advice given by lawyers to the promoters of private bills was mentioned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	277	I would myself be in no doubt at all but that advice and assistance given by lawyers to promoters of private bills , although often , perhaps usually , presentational in character , would qualify for legal advice privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	278	The relevant legal context seems to me clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	279	The same would apply to advice by lawyers given to opponents of the proposed bill . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott

121	281	Mr Jonathan Crow , in a written reply submission on behalf of the Attorney-General , has referred to advice given by Parliamentary counsel to the Government in relation to the drafting and preparation of public bills . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	282	This advice , too , Mr Crow submitted , should qualify for legal advice privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	283	I agree that , here too , the relevant legal context is unmistakable and that legal advice privilege should apply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	284	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	285	Mr Pollock referred to advice sought from and given by a lawyer as to how to set about joining a private club . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	286	He put this forward as an obvious example of a case where legal advice privilege would not be attracted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	287	The reason , Mr Pollock suggested , was that the advice being sought would not relate to the client 's legal rights or obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	288	I agree that legal advice privilege would not be attracted , not because the advice would necessarily not relate to the client 's legal rights or obligations but because the bare bones of Mr Pollock 's example had no legal context whatever . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	289	If his example were embellished with detail the answer might be different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	290	Suppose the applicant for membership of the club had previously made an unsuccessful application to join the club , believed that his rejection had been inconsistent with the club 's admission rules and wanted to make a fresh application with a view to testing the legality of his rejection if he were again to be blackballed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	291	I think Mr Pollock would accept that in those circumstances the communications between the lawyer and the applicant would be protected by legal advice privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	292	It would be protected because the communication would have a relevant legal context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	293	It would relate to the legal remedies that might be available if the applicant 's application were again unsuccessful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	294	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	295	There may , as I have said , be marginal cases where the answer is not easy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	296	But , in my opinion , the present case is not in the least marginal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	297	The preparation of the evidence to be submitted and the submissions to be made to the Inquiry on behalf of the Bank were for the purpose of enhancing the Bank 's prospects of persuading the Inquiry that its discharge of its public law obligations under the Banking Acts in relation to BCCI was not deserving of criticism and had been reasonable in the circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	298	The presentational advice given by Freshfields and counsel for that purpose was advice `` as to what should prudently and sensibly be done in the relevant legal context '' -LRB- Balabel v Air India supra at p. 330 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	299	The `` relevant legal context '' was the Bingham Inquiry and the question whether the Bank had properly discharged its public law duties under the Banking Acts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	300	The presentational advice falls , in my opinion , squarely within the policy reasons underlying legal advice privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	301	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	302	I would be of the same opinion in relation to presentational advice sought from lawyers by any individual or company who believed himself , herself or itself to be at risk of criticism by an inquiry , whether a coroner 's inquest , a statutory inquiry under the 1921 Act or an ad hoc inquiry such as the Bingham Inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	303	The defence of personal reputation and integrity is at least as important to many individuals and companies as the pursuit or defence of legal rights whether under private law or public law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	304	The skills of professional lawyers when advising a client what evidence to place before an inquiry and how to present the client and his story to the inquiry in the most favourable light are , in my opinion , unquestionably legal skills being applied in a relevant legal context .

121	354	In these circumstances it is unnecessary to analyse more fully the characteristics of those kinds of proceedings which do attract litigation privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	355	In his dissenting speech in In re L Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead sounded a note of caution against basing any such analysis simply on the distinction between `` adversarial '' and `` inquisitorial '' proceedings : -LSB- 1997 -RSB- AC 16 , 31G-32D . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	356	In the meantime those cautionary words have gained force since , for the purposes of the Human Rights Act 1998 , one of the characteristics of a fair trial under article 6 is that the proceedings should be `` adversarial '' : e g Lobo Machado v Portugal -LRB- 1996 -RRB- 23 EHRR 79 , para 31 .

121	360	The rationale of legal advice privilege has been identified in numerous cases , many of which are cited in the speeches of Lord Scott and Lord Carswell . 	lord rodger	lord carswell	partagr	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	361	I need not repeat them but venture to add a passage from Sir George Mackenzie 's Observations upon the 18th Act of the 23rd Parliament of King James the Sixth against Dispositions made in Defraud of Creditors etc -LRB- 1675 -RRB- , in Sir George Mackenzie 's Works Vol 2 -LRB- 1755 -RRB- , p 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	362	He said this , at p 44 : `` An Advocate is by the Nature of his Imployment tied to the same Faithfulness that any Depositor is : For his Client has depositate in his Breast his greatest Secrets ; and it is the Interest of the Common-wealth , to have that Freedom allowed and secured without which Men can not manage their Affairs and private Business : And who would use that Freedom if they might be ensnared by it ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	363	This were to beget a Diffidence betwixt such who should , of all others , have the greatest mutual Confidence with one another ; and this will make Men so jealous of their Advocates that they will lose their private Business , or succumb in their just Defence , rather than Hazard the opening of their Secrets to those who can give them no Advice when the case is Half concealed , or may be forced to discover them when revealed . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	364	As this passage shows , the public interest justification for the privilege is the same today as it was 350 years ago : it does not change , or need to change , because it is rooted in an aspect of human nature which does not change either . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	365	If the advice given by lawyers is to be sound , their clients must make them aware of all the relevant circumstances of the problem . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	366	Clients will be reluctant to do so , however , unless they can be sure that what they say about any potentially damaging or embarrassing circumstances will not be revealed later . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	367	So it is settled that , in the absence of a waiver by the client , communications between clients and their lawyers for the purpose of obtaining legal advice must be kept confidential and can not be made the subject of evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	368	Of course , this means that , from time to time , a tribunal will be deprived of potentially useful evidence but the public interest in people being properly advised on matters of law is held to outweigh the competing public interest in making that evidence available . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	369	As Lord Reid succinctly remarked in Duke of Argyll v Duchess of Argyll 1962 SC -LRB- HL -RRB- 88 , 93 , `` the effect , and indeed the purpose , of the law of confidentiality is to prevent the court from ascertaining the truth so far as regards those matters which the law holds to be confidential .

121	371	Despite its long pedigree the Court of Appeal in this case appear to have been less than enthusiastic about the very notion of legal advice privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	372	In particular , they thought that it was not clear why it should attach to matters such as the conveyance of real property or the drawing up of a will : -LSB- 2004 -RSB- QB 916 , 935 , para 39 per Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR. I do not share these doubts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	373	A client 's financial or tax position , or the financial or tax position of members of his family , may well be relevant to the way in which he asks his solicitor to structure a property transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	374	Or else , for example , the client may have private worries about his son 's ability to fend for himself which explain why he conveys a more valuable property to his son than to his more able daughter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	375	People have a legitimate interest in keeping such matters private . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	376	The case for confidentiality is , if anything , even more obvious when it comes to the preparation of a will . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	377	Rightly or wrongly , the provisions are often shaped by past relationships , indiscretions , experiences , impressions and mistakes , as well as by jealousies , slights , animosities and affections , which the testator would not wish to have revealed but which he must nevertheless explain if the solicitor is to carry out his wishes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	378	Divulging the provisions during the testator 's lifetime or disclosing the reasons for them after the testator 's death could often cause incalculable harm and misery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	379	The public interest lies in minimising the risk of that happening . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	380	In these circumstances it is , in the words of Sir George Mackenzie , Works vol 2 , p 45 , the interest of the commonwealth `` not to unseal the Secrets of private Persons and thereby to render all Trust and Commerce suspect .

121	382	More often than not the lawyer will be advising his client on legal matters that relate to his own position - whether his public law or private law rights and obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	383	Legal advice privilege also applies to advice on criminal matters , which it may not always be easy to characterise as relating , strictly speaking , to rights and obligations of the client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	384	Mr Pollock QC accepted that legal advice privilege would apply in all these cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	385	In other cases , such as that of an objector at a public inquiry , the advice sought may relate partly to the client 's own legal position and partly to the position of someone else , such as the developer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	386	But clients may also legitimately consult their lawyers simply about someone else 's legal position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	387	Most obviously , a concerned parent may consult a lawyer about the potential repercussions for their adult child of some step which that child is contemplating . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott

121	391	In the present case the Court of Appeal proceeded , -LSB- 2004 -RSB- QB 916 , 932 , on the basis that `` the dominant role of Freshfields was to advise on preparation and presentation of evidence for the Bingham Inquiry but that it is possible that they may have given some advice as to the Bank 's legal rights and obligations '' and that `` the advice and assistance sought was primarily in relation to the presentation of evidence to the inquiry rather than in relation to the Bank 's rights and obligations . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	392	Mr Sumption QC criticised that conclusion but , simply for present purposes , I am content to accept it without addressing those criticisms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	393	The implication of the Court of Appeal 's judgment that in these circumstances legal advice privilege is not engaged must be that , when the Bank were communicating with Freshfields in relation to the presentation of their evidence to the inquiry , they were not seeking legal advice from them .

121	395	In his important judgment in Balabel v Air India -LSB- 1988 -RSB- Ch 317 , 331H - 332B , Taylor LJ seems to have thought that in the past the business of solicitors was more restricted than it is today and that there is therefore now more of a need to keep legal advice privilege within justifiable bounds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	396	In the present case the Court of Appeal adopted that observation , -LSB- 2004 -RSB- QB 916 , 933 , para 30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	397	As counsel for both parties accepted , however , what Taylor LJ says in that passage is , at best , an over-simplification . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	398	Especially in the nineteenth century , many solicitors or attorneys acted as `` men of business '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	399	They not only gave legal advice and assistance but carried on business , for instance , as patent agents , as agents for insurance companies , as deposit agents for colonial banks , and as stewards or factors running estates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	400	They would also lend money to their clients , sometimes in relation to the purchase of property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	401	Until fairly recently indeed , Scottish solicitors had succeeded in keeping for themselves all the work of selling houses that estate agents were doing in England . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	402	Given the varied functions performed by lawyers , it is scarcely surprising that questions frequently arose as to the capacity in which the lawyer or firm was acting in a particular transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	403	For example , in both Hagart and Burn-Murdoch v Inland Revenue Commissioners -LSB- 1929 -RSB- AC 386 and Minter v Priest -LSB- 1930 -RSB- AC 558 the House had to decide in what capacity solicitors had lent money to clients . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	404	And one of the issues in Minter was , precisely , the application of legal advice privilege in that kind of case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	405	Lawyers today may be instructed in situations in which they would not have been instructed in the past or which did not even exist in the past ; equally , however , lawyers in the past were employed in situations in which they would not be employed today and which do not even exist today . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	406	In relation to legal advice privilege what matters today remains the same as what mattered in the past : whether the lawyers are being asked qua lawyers to provide legal advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott

121	408	In Balabel v Air India -LSB- 1988 -RSB- Ch 317 , 330 Taylor LJ reviewed the authorities and held that , for the purposes of legal advice privilege , `` legal advice is not confined to telling the client the law ; it must include advice as to what should prudently and sensibly be done in the relevant legal context . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	409	According to his terms of reference , Bingham LJ was to enquire into the supervision of BCCI under the Banking Acts and to consider whether the action taken by all the United Kingdom authorities was appropriate and timely . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	410	Therefore the Banking Acts formed the relevant legal context in which Freshfields were asked to act for the Bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	411	So far as the Bank were concerned , what Bingham LJ had to decide was whether or not the steps that they took to supervise BCCI had been appropriate , having regard to their powers and duties under the Banking Acts as they stood at the relevant time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	412	The Bank 's evidence to the inquiry was directed to that issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	413	It may be - the House was not told - that the BIU consulted other professionals , such as bankers , accountants or actuaries , about the presentation of the Bank 's evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	414	If so , the BIU would have expected them to bring their particular expertise to bear on the evidence and to comment accordingly - alerting the Bank , for instance , to any possible grounds of criticism , or to particularly favourable points which they noticed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	415	Similarly , if - and there is no reason to suppose this happened - the BIU had sought advice from the modern equivalent of a rhetorician on how to make sure that the Bank 's evidence would be presented to the inquiry in a way that made it easily understood and assimilated , it would have expected him to use his rhetorical expertise when making his comments on the drafts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	416	60 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	417	When , however , the BIU consulted the lawyers in Freshfields , and through them counsel , about the presentation of their evidence to the inquiry , it was not seeking their comments and assistance as bankers , accountants , rhetoricians or anything else : it was seeking their comments and assistance as lawyers professing expertise in the field . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	418	Either expressly or impliedly , the BIU was asking them to put on legal spectacles when reading , considering and commenting on the drafts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	419	In other words it was asking them to consider , as lawyers , how the Bank 's evidence could be most effectively presented to Bingham LJ , given that he was inquiring into the Bank 's discharge of their legal responsibilities under the Banking Acts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	420	Such advice could come in many forms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	421	For instance , the BIU could have expected Freshfields to draw attention to any implications , favourable or otherwise , which a particular line of evidence on one aspect of the Bank 's supervisory obligations might have for a different aspect of their responsibilities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	422	Similarly , Freshfields would be in a position to point out matters which should not be laboured in evidence as they would be obvious to a senior judge like Bingham LJ with his ready grasp of the relevant law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	423	Alternatively , they might highlight points that would be worth exploring more fully . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	424	Of course , your Lordships do not know which issues actually arose and were considered by the lawyers when reading the Bank 's draft evidence - far less what comments Freshfields communicated to the BIU which eventually helped to shape the Bank 's `` overarching '' statement to the inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	425	That does not matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	426	What matters is that the BIU was instructing the lawyers in Freshfields to carry out a function which necessarily involved the use of their legal skills if it was to be performed properly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	427	The communications between the BIU and Freshfields were therefore concerned with obtaining `` legal advice '' in the broader sense in which , as Taylor LJ rightly said in Balabel v Air India , that term should be understood for this purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	428	It follows that legal advice privilege applies to those communications . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott

121	436	Legal advice privilege restricts the power of a court to compel the production of what would otherwise be relevant evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	437	It may thus impede the proper administration of justice in the individual case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott

121	449	But much will depend upon whether it is one in which it is reasonable for the client to consult the special professional knowledge and skills of a lawyer , so that the lawyer will be able to give the client sound advice as to what he should do , and just as importantly what he should not do , and how to do it .

121	466	That privilege is commonly classified in modern usage under the two sub-headings of legal advice privilege and litigation privilege -LRB- terminology which appears to owe its origin to the submission of counsel in Re Highgrade Traders Ltd -LSB- 1984 -RSB- BCLC 151 , adopted by Oliver LJ at page 161h -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	467	The former covers communications passing between lawyer and client for the purpose of seeking and furnishing legal advice , whether or not in the context of litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	468	The latter , which is available when legal proceedings are in existence or contemplated , embraces a wider class of communication , such as those passing between the legal adviser and potential witnesses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	469	The relationship between these two classes of privilege formed the subject of much of the argument before the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	470	66 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	471	The Government reacted quickly to the failure of BCCI , largely due to expressions of concern which had emanated from the financial community about the quality of the Bank 's supervision of BCCI under the Banking Acts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	472	On 19 July 1991 it was announced that an independent inquiry would be held into the exercise by the Bank of its statutory duty of supervision of BCCI as a licensed deposit-taker , and on 22 July 1991 Bingham LJ was formally appointed to conduct the inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	473	His comprehensive report on the affair was submitted in July 1992 to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	474	67 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	475	The Bank considered it of great importance to make the most effective response to the Bingham Inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	476	For that purpose the Governor appointed a group of officials who became known as the Bingham Inquiry Unit -LRB- `` BIU '' -RRB- , with the task of dealing with all communications between the Bank and the Inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	477	Messrs Freshfields and counsel were instructed and over a period of time gave extensive advice and assistance , the nature of which is described in detail in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the judgment of Tomlinson J given on 13 December 2002 in Three Rivers District Council v Bank of England -LRB- No 5 -RRB- -LSB- 2003 -RSB- QB 1556 and the documents quoted therein . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	478	In the process the BIU and Freshfields generated a substantial volume of documents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	479	It may be summarised very baldly as the gathering of the necessary information to enable the solicitors and counsel to advise on the way in which the Bank 's case could be presented to the Inquiry , the furnishing of such advice and the preparation and amendment of draft witness statements and submissions to and responses to requests from the Inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	480	It is , however , worth adding to the material quoted by Tomlinson J the contents of paragraph 17 of the second witness statement made by Mr Philip Mark Croall , a partner in Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer , which gives a useful synopsis of the type of work carried out by the BIU and Freshfields : `` So as to ensure that the Bank 's legal advisers were properly instructed and fully informed to advise and assist the Bank in preparing its evidence and more generally in relation to all its dealings with the Bingham Inquiry , there was a constant flow of factual information from the Bank to its legal advisers , usually channelled through the BIU . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	481	The BIU and the Bank 's legal advisers effectively operated as a single team , with members of the BIU undertaking , or delegating to others within the Bank , tasks of research or fact-gathering for the purpose of review and/or advice by the Bank 's legal advisers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	482	Specific requests for factual matters to be investigated and reported -LRB- typically in the form of notes -RRB- to the legal team were sometimes made by the legal team itself to the BIU which then initiated work within the Bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	483	Sometimes such work was carried out by the BIU itself and sometimes by others elsewhere within the Bank commissioned to do so by the BIU . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	484	Fact finding and research based exercises were sometimes commissioned by the BIU itself of its own initiative in order to furnish information to the legal advisers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	485	The purpose of carrying out all of this work was to provide information to the Bank 's legal advisers to enable them to prepare submissions and/or advise on the nature , presentation and/or content of the Bank 's submissions to , evidence for and responses to requests from , the Inquiry . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	486	It was originally intended that witness statements from employees of the Bank and other persons would be furnished to Bingham LJ on behalf of the Bank , but in the event this was not done and the witnesses were called to give evidence to the inquiry without written statements having been supplied in advance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	487	It appears , however , that a substantial volume of communications came into existence in the course of gathering the evidence of witnesses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	488	Moreover , an `` overarching '' statement of some 258 pages was prepared on behalf of the Bank and furnished to the inquiry , which set out its case and the material evidence in some detail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	489	68 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	490	The inquiry itself amassed a large volume of documentation , which has been given the title of the `` Bingham archive '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	491	Much of the satellite litigation to which I have referred has been concerned with attempts by the respondents to obtain access to various categories of documents in order to ascertain if there was material which they could use in support of their case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	492	The phrase `` fishing expedition '' has been used more than once during the course of the series of proceedings , but it is no less than fair to recall the comment of Tomlinson J at paragraph 72 of his judgment given on 31 May 2002 in relation to the Bingham archive : `` If the Claimants are to be regarded as fishing , I am bound to say that they are fishing in waters which can be regarded as likely to be stocked , albeit not exclusively with fish likely to be to their taste .

121	493	69 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	494	The respondents brought two successive applications for disclosure of documents relating to the BIU . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	495	The first , the Court of Appeal decision in which is reported as Three Rivers District Council v Bank of England -LRB- No 5 -RRB- -LSB- 2003 -RSB- QB 1556 , is not directly the subject of this appeal , but an understanding of the issues dealt with in it is essential to consideration of the present proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	496	The second decision of the Court of Appeal , against which this appeal has been brought , is reported under the title of Three Rivers District Council v Bank of England -LRB- No 6 -RRB- -LSB- 2004 -RSB- QB 916 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	497	I shall refer to these proceedings respectively as Three Rivers -LRB- No 5 -RRB- and Three Rivers -LRB- No 6 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	498	70 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	499	In Three Rivers -LRB- No 5 -RRB- the claimants , the present respondents , applied pursuant to CPR r 31.19 for disclosure by the Bank of a large number of documents for which the Bank had claimed legal privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	500	In his judgment given on 13 December 2002 , to which I have referred , Tomlinson J upheld the Bank 's claim and refused the declaratory relief sought by the claimants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	501	His reasons for so holding , which appear to me to have considerable force , are set out in paragraph 30 of his judgment , in which he expressed his conclusion : `` In my judgment an internal confidential document , not being a communication with a third party , which was produced or brought into existence with the dominant purpose that it or its contents be used to obtain legal advice is privileged from production . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	502	The judge stated that the necessary control is supplied by the dominant purpose test , which is applied at the time of creation of the documents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	503	He summarised his conclusion on the dominant purpose test at para 32 of his judgment , where he held that '' ... the Bank has properly identified as the dominant purpose for which much of the material was brought into existence by the BIU the obtaining or recording of legal advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	504	More broadly , the Bank has established that the material was prepared or commissioned pursuant to the retainer between the Bank and the legal advisers as part of the necessary exchange of information of which the object was the giving of legal advice . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	505	71 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	506	The Court of Appeal -LRB- Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR , Sedley and Longmore LJJ -RRB- reversed the judge 's decision , accepting the contention advanced by counsel for the claimants that documents prepared by the Bank 's employees or ex-employees , whether prepared for submission to or at the direction of Freshfields or not , should be disclosed as being no more than raw material on which the BIU , as the client of Freshfields , would thereafter seek advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	507	It accordingly held that the Bank was not entitled to privilege in respect of any of the following four categories of documents in issue : a. documents prepared by Bank employees , the dominant purpose of preparing which was that they should be sent to Freshfields and which were in fact so sent ; b. documents of the same class which were not in fact so sent to Freshfields ; c. documents prepared by Bank employees , without the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advice , which were in fact sent to Freshfields ; d. documents in categories a to c which had been prepared by Bank employees who were no longer employed by the Bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	508	72 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	509	The court accepted that Freshfields ' client was the BIU , not the Bank itself or any individual officer , but its conclusions did not turn so much on the identity of the authors of the documents in question as on the more general point that in the court 's view legal advice privilege , as distinct from litigation privilege , was restricted to communications between a client and his legal advisers , to documents evidencing such communications , and to documents that were intended to be such communications even if they were not in fact communicated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	510	None of the four categories of documents concerned in the appeal came within that description and accordingly they were not covered by privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	511	It rejected the Bank 's argument that communications from an employee were so covered , even though it recognised that a corporation can only act through its employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	512	73 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	513	The court reached a subsidiary but distinct conclusion on a second issue , the dominant purpose of the preparation of the documents , which was set out in paragraph 35 of the judgment of the court , given by Longmore LJ : `` In the former case of original documentary material supplied to assist in the compilation of the November 1991 statement or April 1992 paper , we think it impossible to say that the dominant purpose of its preparation was the obtaining of legal advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	514	It is raw material for presentation to the inquiry and the dominant purpose for which it was prepared was so that the Bank could comply with its primary duty of putting all relevant factual material before Bingham LJ . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	515	74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	516	The Bank presented a petition for leave to appeal to your Lordships ' House , but on 14 May 2003 the Appeal Committee dismissed the petition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	517	The Bank has disclosed documents to the respondents in accordance with the ruling of the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	518	The respondents , as they state in their printed case , found that those documents proved to be a `` veritable gold-mine of factual information as to what had happened during the years of BCCI 's supervision and as to what various Bank officials had really thought . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	519	75 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	520	In Three Rivers -LRB- No 5 -RRB- Mr Pollock QC , leading counsel for the respondents , made it clear that he did not seek disclosure of any documents passing between Freshfields and the BIU , regarding them on thitherto accepted principle as being covered by legal advice privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	521	In the light of the content of the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the second issue in Three Rivers -LRB- No 5 -RRB- the respondents mounted a further application - Three Rivers -LRB- No 6 -RRB- - seeking disclosure of communications between the BIU and Freshfields in so far as those were seeking or obtaining assistance or advice as to the manner in which the Bank should most appropriately present evidence and material to the inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	522	The essence of the case made by the respondents was that although the Court of Appeal had declared that the Bank was entitled to claim privilege for communications passing between the Bank and its legal advisers for the purpose of obtaining legal advice , the term `` legal advice '' was limited to advice on the legal rights and obligations of the Bank and , specifically , did not extend to advice and assistance directed towards the better presentation of the Bank 's case to the inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	523	Tomlinson J permitted Mr Pollock to withdraw the concession which he had made in Three Rivers -LRB- No 5 -RRB- and to present this new argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	524	He expressed the view that it was implicit in the decision of the Court of Appeal in Three Rivers -LRB- No 5 -RRB- that it did not regard Freshfields ' assistance and advice on presentational matters as attracting legal advice privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	525	He held accordingly and made a declaration that `` the only documents or parts of documents in the Bank 's control and coming into existence between the closure of BCCI SA on 5 July 1991 and the issue of the present proceedings in May 1993 which the Bank is entitled to withhold from inspection on the ground of legal advice privilege are : -LRB- 1 -RRB- communications passing between the Bank and its legal advisers -LRB- including any solicitor seconded to the Bank -RRB- for the purpose of seeking or obtaining legal advice -LRB- which means , for the avoidance of doubt , advice concerning the Bank 's rights and obligations -RRB- ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- any part of a document which evidences the substance of such a communication . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	526	He ordered that the Bank should serve a further and better list of documents and make them available for inspection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	527	76 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	528	The Court of Appeal -LRB- Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR , Longmore and Thomas LJJ -RRB- dismissed the Bank 's appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	529	In giving the judgment of the court , the Master of the Rolls commenced by defining legal advice , not as advice given by a lawyer but as `` advice in relation to law '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	530	He examined in some detail a series of authorities , which I shall consider in due course , and concluded -LRB- para 16 -RRB- that the statements in them lent support to the argument that legal advice is restricted to advice about legal rights and liabilities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	531	He referred -LRB- para 25 -RRB- to the opinion expressed by the Law Reform Committee in its 16th Report on Privilege in Civil Proceedings -LRB- 1967 -RRB- -LRB- Cmnd 3472 -RRB- , to the effect that the true rationale of legal advice privilege was that it was `` a privilege in aid of litigation '' and was concerned exclusively with rights and liabilities enforceable in law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	532	He regarded the authorities as supporting that statement , since he considered that in all of them the relationship of solicitor and client arose in relation to transactions involving legal rights and obligations capable of becoming the subject matter of litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	533	The court set out in paragraph 26 the conclusion which it drew from this examination : `` In summary , the authorities to which we have referred show that , where a solicitor-client relationship is formed for the purpose of obtaining advice or assistance in relation to rights and liabilities , broad protection will be given to communications passing between solicitor and client in the course of that relationship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	534	In all the cases , however , the primary object of the relationship was to obtain assistance that required knowledge of the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	535	We do not consider that the same principle applies to communications between solicitor and client when the dominant purpose is not the obtaining of advice and assistance in relation to legal rights and obligations . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	536	77 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	537	The Court of Appeal rejected -LRB- para 28 -RRB- the Bank 's argument that since the subject matter of the inquiry was very sensitive and the Bank could be subject to criticism or blame as a result of its findings , the giving of advice and assistance by the solicitors , being designed to protect the Bank against such a possibility , was in the context of a professional relationship that involved advising on legal rights and obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	538	It held that the advice and assistance sought was primarily in relation to the presentation of evidence to the inquiry rather than in relation to the Bank 's rights and obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	539	Nor did the possibility of damage to the Bank 's reputation suffice to attract legal advice privilege for the communications in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	540	Although the role of the solicitor might have widened in recent times , the extent of legal advice privilege should not be widened to encompass that extension . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	541	The court expressed this conclusion in paragraph 37 of its judgment : `` We do not consider that the facts of this case justify this extension to the law of privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	542	The inquiry in this case was a private , non-statutory inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	543	One of the sponsors of that inquiry , albeit a reluctant sponsor , was the Bank itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	544	The Bank 's primary concern was , or should have been , to ascertain whether the collapse of BCCI was attributable to any regulatory shortcomings in this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	545	We can not see that in these circumstances communications between the Bank and the solicitors who were assisting in the obtaining , preparation and presentation of evidence and submissions to the inquiry should attract privilege , even if the Bank was anxious that this assistance should enable the Bank 's role to be presented in the best possible light .

121	546	78 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	547	The Master of the Rolls concluded his judgment with remarks in paragraph 39 which caused a degree of concern to the interveners in the appeal before the House , HM Government , the Bar Council and the Law Society : `` We have found this area of the law not merely difficult but unsatisfactory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	548	The justification for litigation privilege is readily understood . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	549	Where , however , litigation is not anticipated it is not easy to see why communications with a solicitor should be privileged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	550	Legal advice privilege attaches to matters such as the conveyance of real property or the drawing up of a will . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	551	It is not clear why it should . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	552	There would seem little reason to fear that , if privilege were not available in such circumstances , communications between solicitor and client would be inhibited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	553	Nearly fifty years have passed since the Law Reform Committee looked at this area . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	554	It is perhaps time for it to receive a further review . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	555	79 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	556	Mr Sumption QC presented the case on behalf of the Bank on two main grounds , one broader and one narrower . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	557	The essence of the former was that legal advice privilege attaches to the documents in question , as being communications between lawyer and client constituting advice and assistance of a kind which it is part of the proper function of a lawyer to give by virtue of his legal skills . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	558	Mr Pollock , upholding the decision of the Court of Appeal , contended that legal advice privilege is an `` outgrowth and extension '' of litigation privilege , the true root of legal professional privilege , which should be closely confined in extent to advice on legal rights and obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	559	It did not cover advice and assistance in the presentation of a client 's case before a tribunal such as the Bingham Inquiry , the outcome of which did not have legal consequences for that client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	560	Mr Sumption challenged this last point in advancing his narrower submission , to the effect that the Bingham Inquiry did have considerable potential legal consequences for the Bank , and that even on the definition of legal advice propounded by the Court of Appeal Freshfields ' advice to it was covered by legal advice privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	561	80 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	562	It is convenient first to consider the narrower submission , which involves looking at the nature of the inquiry and the implications which it held for the Bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	563	The terms of reference were : `` To enquire into the supervision of BCCI under the Banking Acts ; to consider whether the action taken by all the UK authorities was appropriate and timely ; and to make recommendations . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	564	The focus of the inquiry was always going to be a critical examination of the Bank 's performance of its supervisory duties under the Banking Acts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	565	It was apparent that some would seek to attach blame to the Bank for failing to take earlier action - the then Prime Minister stated in the House of Commons that the inquiry would `` determine where the blame lies '' - and that public criticism in the inquiry report of the conduct of some officials was a distinct possibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	566	Nor could one rule out the possibility that some amendment , which might be unwelcome to the Bank , of its regulatory powers and duties might be recommended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	567	There appears accordingly to be some substance in the suggestion made by Mr Croall in paragraph 8 of his second witness statement that `` any criticism and consequential damage to its reputation -LRB- or to that of any of its senior officials in the Banking Supervision Division -RRB- might impair its ability to supervise effectively .

121	568	81 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	569	Under section 1 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the Banking Act 1987 the Bank was immune against ordinary civil liability for failure to perform its duty to supervise deposit takers , but if bad faith were established it would be liable to remedies in private law .

121	571	82 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	572	In these circumstances I consider that the observations made by Tomlinson J were justified , when he stated at paragraph 7 of his judgment in Three Rivers -LRB- No 5 -RRB- : `` Anything that the Bank did and said in relation to the Inquiry was potentially of great legal sensitivity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	573	It was an inquiry one outcome of which could be criticism of the conduct of the Bank from an informed and highly authoritative source , an outcome which would not only be of some importance in relation to the Bank 's ongoing regulatory and supervisory role but would itself be likely either to lead to or to encourage the institution or attempted institution of proceeding against the Bank by depositors and others who had lost money in consequence of the collapse of BCCI . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	574	Again , in paragraph 15 of that judgment the judge referred to the `` obvious possibility '' that litigation might in due course be instituted against the Bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	575	Bingham LJ also appears to have envisaged the same possibility when he referred in his covering letter of July 1992 to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank to `` any forthcoming litigation '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	576	83 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	577	Counsel for the Bank did not seek to argue that this possibility was sufficient to make the case one of litigation privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	578	For that head of privilege to apply litigation must be reasonably in prospect : see Matthews & Malek , Disclosure , 2nd ed -LRB- 2001 -RRB- para 9.034 and authorities cited there . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	579	He did contend , however , that the prospect of litigation , added to that of criticism and blame and the possibility of amendment of the regulatory regime , meant that the advice and assistance given by Freshfields concerned the Bank 's legal rights and obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	580	If , contrary to his submission , the Court of Appeal was correct in its definition of legal advice for which privilege can be claimed , the advice and assistance given fell within that definition on a correct view of the facts of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	581	The Court of Appeal was not correct in stating at paragraph 28 of the judgment of the court that the matter was concluded by the judge 's finding in paragraph 8 of his judgment , for that was to disregard what he stated in paragraphs 7 and 15 which I have quoted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	582	84 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	583	In my opinion there is substantial force in the appellant 's argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	584	Even if the definition of legal advice adopted by the Court of Appeal is to be regarded as correct , the circumstances in which the Bank sought advice and assistance from Freshfields were such that much of the focus was on the legal rights and obligations of the Bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	585	There may be room for argument , however , on the question whether that was the dominant purpose of the Bank in seeking that advice and assistance , but I do not propose to attempt to resolve that issue or to determine the appeal on this ground alone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	586	I think that it is of some importance for the House to take the opportunity to examine more generally the basis of legal advice privilege and the correctness of the major thesis of the Court of Appeal in its judgment in this case .

121	587	85 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	588	The object of litigation privilege was described in the classic statement of Jessel MR in Anderson v Bank of British Columbia -LRB- 1876 -RRB- 2 Ch D 644 at 649 : `` The object and meaning of the rule is this : that as , by reason of the complexity and difficulty of our law , litigation can only be properly conducted by professional men , it is absolutely necessary that a man , in order to prosecute his rights or to defend himself from an improper claim , should have recourse to the assistance of professional lawyers , and it being so absolutely necessary , it is equally necessary , to use a vulgar phrase , that he should be able to make a clean breast of it to the gentleman whom he consults with a view to the prosecution of his claim , or the substantiating his defence against the claim of others ; that he should be able to place unrestricted and unbounded confidence in the professional agent , and that the communications he so makes to him should be kept secret , unless with his consent -LRB- for it is his privilege , and not the privilege of the confidential agent -RRB- , that he should be enabled properly to conduct his litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	589	That is the meaning of the rule . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	590	86 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	591	Determining the bounds of privilege involves finding the proper point of balance between two opposing imperatives , making the maximum relevant material available to the court of trial and avoiding unfairness to individuals by revealing confidential communications between their lawyers and themselves . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	592	The practice which has developed is a reconciliation between these principles : Seabrook v British Transport Commission -LSB- 1959 -RSB- 1 WLR 509 at 513 , per Havers J . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	593	There is a considerable public interest in each of these . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	594	The importance of keeping to a minimum the withholding of relevant material from the court , upon which Mr Pollock laid emphasis , is self-evident . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	595	It was stressed by Wigmore -LRB- Evidence , vol 8 , para 2291 McNaughton rev. 1961 -RRB- , who expressed the opinion that the privilege should be strictly confined within the narrowest possible limits consistent with the logic of its principle , an approach echoed in the speech of Lord Edmund-Davies in Waugh v British Railways Board -LSB- 1980 -RSB- AC 521 at 543 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	596	The competing principle of legal professional privilege is also rooted in public policy : cf B v Auckland District Law Society -LSB- 2003 -RSB- 2 AC 736 , paras 46-7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	597	It is not based upon the maintenance of confidentiality , although in earlier case-law that was given as its foundation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	598	If that were the only reason behind the principle the same privilege would be extended to such confidants as priests and doctors , whereas it has been settled in a line of authority stemming from the Duchess of Kingston 's Case -LRB- 1776 -RRB- 1 East PC 469 that it is confined to legal advisers : see , eg , Cross & Tapper on Evidence , 9th ed , pp 461-5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	599	87 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	600	It is stated in Cross & Tapper , op cit , p 439 that in England the rule was traditionally regarded as a rule of evidence , but the learned editor points out that in some Commonwealth jurisdictions `` The privilege was elevated into something more nearly resembling a basic constitutional principle , expressed in the rhetoric of rights . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	601	That development has been mirrored in this jurisdiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	602	In R v Derby Magistrates ' Court , ex parte B -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 487 Lord Taylor of Gosforth CJ , with whose reasons the other members of the House agreed , stated at page 509 , after reviewing the authorities : `` The principle which runs through all these cases , and the many other cases which were cited , is that a man must be able to consult his lawyer in confidence , since otherwise he might hold back half the truth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	603	The client must be sure that what he tells his lawyer will never be revealed without his consent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	604	Legal professional privilege is thus much more than an ordinary rule of evidence , limited in its application to the facts of a particular case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	605	It is a fundamental condition on which the administration of justice as a whole rests . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	606	Lord Hoffmann expressed himself similarly , again with the concurrence of the other members of the House , in R -LRB- Morgan Grenfell & Co Ltd -RRB- v Special Commissioner of Income Tax -LSB- 2003 -RSB- 1 AC 563 , when he described legal professional privilege in paragraph 7 as `` a fundamental human right long established in the common law . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	607	In paragraph 31 he referred with approval to the judgments of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in IRC v West-Walker -LSB- 1954 -RSB- NZLR 191 , where the privilege was described as not merely a rule of evidence but a substantive right founded on an important public policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	608	88 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	609	The approach of the Court of Appeal to ascertaining the ambit of legal advice which will attract privilege was conditioned by its acceptance of Mr Pollock 's proposition to which I have referred , that legal professional privilege is an outgrowth and extension of litigation privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	610	The Master of the Rolls stated at paragraph 25 of the judgment of the court : `` All of the cases to which we have thus far referred were ones in which the relationship of client and solicitor arose in relation to transactions involving legal rights and obligations capable of becoming the subject matter of litigation . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	611	One must therefore commence consideration of this part of the case by examining the validity of the proposition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	612	One has to ask the question , does legal professional privilege stem from litigation , as the Court of Appeal held , in which event any extension of it outside that sphere requires to be carefully limited ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	613	Or is it , as the appellant contended , a more general privilege based on the relationship of lawyer and client and so extending to a wider area of advice and assistance given by legal advisers to their clients ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	614	Subsidiary arguments were developed about the need for certainty and the inconvenience which would ensue if the ruling given by the Court of Appeal were generally applied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	615	But if answers are found to these questions which embody proper principles and are consistent with established lines of authority , that will , I think , take one a good distance towards conclusions which will settle the issues debated in this part of the case under appeal .

121	616	89 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	617	I propose to commence that search by examining the authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	618	The arguments on the issue of principle depend to a large extent on one 's starting point , which is determined by the answers to the questions which I have posed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	619	There is no a priori reason why legal professional privilege should be regarded as stemming from litigation rather than more generally from the giving of legal advice , or vice versa , and therefore it is of assistance to attempt to ascertain the direction which the law has taken on this topic .

121	620	90 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	621	Both the appellant and the respondents claimed that the decided cases supported their respective interpretations of the law , so it is necessary to consider them in some detail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	622	The early history of legal privilege is set out in the speech of Lord Taylor of Gosforth CJ in R v Derby Magistrates , ex parte B -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 487 at 507 et seq , where he traces it back to the earliest instances , to be found in 16th century reports , and follows it through a number of cases in the 18th and 19th centuries . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	623	For present purposes it is sufficient to commence with the case of Greenough v Gaskell 1 My & K 98 , decided by Lord Brougham LC in 1833 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	624	The defendant in the suit , a solicitor , objected to being required to produce book entries , memoranda , letters and other papers generated over a period in the course of furnishing professional legal advice to his client , to whom money was advanced out of a fund in court in an administration suit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	625	In his judgment Lord Brougham LC set out his conclusions on the claim to privilege in a passage at pages 101-3 which is worth quoting at length , since it is the fons et origo of the modern law : `` Here the question relates to the solicitor , who is called upon to produce the entries he had made in accounts , and letters received by him , and those written -LRB- chiefly to his town agent -RRB- by him , or by his direction , in his character or situation of confidential solicitor to the party ; and I am of opinion that he can not be compelled to disclose papers delivered , or communications made to him , or letters , or entries made by him in that capacity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	626	To compel a party himself to answer upon oath , even as to his belief or his thoughts , is one thing ; nay , to compel him to disclose what he has written or spoken to others , not being his professional advisers , is competent to the party seeking the discovery ; for such communications are not necessary to the conduct of judicial business , and the defence or prosecution of men 's rights by the aid of skilful persons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	627	To force from the party himself the production of communications made by him to professional men seems inconsistent with the possibility of an ignorant man safely resorting to professional advice , and can only be justified if the authority of decided cases warrants it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	628	But no authority sanctions the much wider violation of professional confidence , and in circumstances wholly different , which would be involved in compelling counsel or attorneys or solicitors to disclose matters committed to them in their professional capacity , and which , but for their employment as professional men , they would not have become possessed of . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	629	As regards them , it does not appear that the protection is qualified by any reference to proceedings pending or in contemplation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	630	If touching matters that come within the ordinary scope of professional employment , they receive a communication in their professional capacity , either from a client , or on his account , and for his benefit in the transaction of his business , or , which amounts to the same thing , if they commit to paper , in the course of their employment on his behalf , matters which they know only through their professional relation to the client , they are not only justified in withholding such matters , but bound to withhold them , and will not be compelled to disclose the information or produce the papers in any Court of law or equity , either as party or as witness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	631	If this protection were confined to cases where proceedings had commenced , the rule would exclude the most confidential , and it may be the most important of all communications - those made with a view of being prepared either for instituting or defending a suit , up to the instant that the process of the Court issued . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	632	If it were confined to proceedings begun or in contemplation , then every communication would be unprotected which a party makes with a view to his general defence against attacks which he apprehends , although at the time no one may have resolved to assail him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	633	But were it allowed to extend over such communications , the protection would be insufficient , if it only included communications more or less connected with judicial proceedings ; for a person oftentimes requires the aid of professional advice upon the subject of his rights and his liabilities , with no references to any particular litigation , and without any other reference to litigation generally than all human affairs have , in so far as every transaction may , by possibility , become the subject of judicial inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	634	` It would be most mischievous , ' said the learned Judges in the Common Pleas , ` if it could be doubted whether or not an attorney , consulted upon a man 's title to an estate , was at liberty to divulge a flaw ' -LRB- 2 Brod . & Bingh . 6 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	635	The foundation of this rule is not difficult to discover . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	636	It is not -LRB- as has sometimes been said -RRB- on account of any particular importance which the law attributes to the business of legal professors , or any particular disposition to afford them protection , though certainly it may not be very easy to discover why a like privilege has been refused to others , and especially to medical advisers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	637	But it is out of regard to the interests of justice , which can not be upholden , and to the administration of justice , which can not go on , without the aid of men skilled in jurisprudence , in the practice of the Courts , and in those matters affecting rights and obligations which form the subject of all judicial proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	638	If the privilege did not exist at all , every one would be thrown upon his own legal resources ; deprived of all professional assistance , a man would not venture to consult any skilful person , or would only dare to tell his counsellor half his case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott

NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	643	He stated at pages 94-5 : `` But further , I think that restriction of the rule is not consistent with , and not founded on , any sound principle ; for it may , and in a great variety of cases would , be of as much importance to parties that the communications made between a client and a solicitor with respect to the state of the client 's property , with respect to his liabilities , with respect to his title , should be protected , as that protection should be afforded to communications made in the progress of a cause ; and it appears to me that , as individuals must from time to time resort to their legal advisers for guidance in their ordinary transactions , public policy requires that communications of that kind should be privileged and protected , in order that they may be free and unfettered .

121	665	A statement of the rationale of legal privilege which is consistent with the approach in the cases which I have cited may be found in the European case-law in the opinion of Mr Advocate-General Sir Gordon Slynn in Case 155/79 A M & S Europe Ltd v Commission -LSB- 1983 -RSB- QB 878 , 913 : `` Whether it is described as the right of the client or the duty of the lawyer , this principle has nothing to do with the protection or privilege of the lawyer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	666	It springs essentially from the basic need of a man in a civilised society to be able to turn to his lawyer for advice and help , and if proceedings begin , for representation ; it springs no less from the advantages to a society which evolves complex law reaching into all the business affairs of persons , real and legal , that they should be able to know what they can do under the law , what is forbidden , where they must tread circumspectly , where they run risks .

121	668	The branch of legal professional privilege which is classified under the name of litigation privilege had a later origin in three cases decided in the later part of the 19th century , which were discussed in detail by the Court of Appeal in Three Rivers -LRB- No 5 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	669	The first was Anderson v Bank of British Columbia -LRB- 1876 -RRB- 2 Ch D 644 , to which I have already referred briefly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	670	The management of the defendant bank , whose headquarters were in London , apprehended litigation concerning the conduct of an account in a branch in Portland , Oregon . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	671	The London manager accordingly cabled the branch manager in Portland , requesting `` fullest particulars '' of the transactions in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	672	The latter duly sent details by letter , which was discussed with the Bank 's solicitor at a meeting of the board of directors in London . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	673	In the ensuing litigation privilege was claimed for the letter , but refused by Jessel MR and the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	674	As Bingham LJ observed in Ventouris v Mountain -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 607 at 612 , on modern principles the Oregon manager 's letter would be regarded as privileged as a letter written for the purpose of laying before a solicitor in order to obtain legal advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	675	The importance of the case , however , lies not in the conclusion reached but in the statements of the law propounded by the judges who heard the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	676	97 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	677	Jessel MR defined the extent of the rule at pages 649-50 : `` Now , as to the extent of the rule . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	678	It goes not merely to a communication made to the professional agent himself by the client directly , it goes to all communications made by the client to the solicitor through intermediate agents , and he is not bound to write letters through the post , or to go himself personally to see the solicitor ; he may employ a third person to write the letter , or he may send the letters through a messenger , or he may give a verbal message to a messenger , and ask him to deliver it to the solicitor , with a view to his prosecuting his claim , or of substantiating his defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	679	Again , the solicitor 's acts must be protected for the use of the client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	680	The solicitor requires further information , and says , I will obtain it from a third person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	681	That is confidential . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	682	It is obtained by him as solicitor for the purpose of the litigation , and it must be protected upon the same ground , otherwise it would be dangerous , if not impossible , to employ a solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	683	You can not ask him what the information he obtained was . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	684	It may be information simply for the purpose of knowing whether he ought to defend or prosecute the action , but it may be also obtained in the shape of collecting evidence for the purpose of such prosecution or defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	685	All that , therefore , is privileged . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	686	In the Court of Appeal James LJ described the principle shortly at page 656 as being `` that as you have no right to see your adversary 's brief , you have no right to see that which comes into existence merely as the materials for the brief . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	687	Mellish LJ at page 658 said : `` To be privileged it must come within one of two classes of privilege , namely , that a man is not bound to disclose confidential communications made between him and his solicitor , directly , or through an agent who is to communicate them to the solicitor ; or , secondly , that he is not bound to communicate evidence which he has obtained for the purpose of litigation .

121	689	In the second case of this trilogy , Southwark and Vauxhall Water Co v Quick -LRB- 1878 -RRB- 3 QBD 315 , documents prepared with the intention of laying them before the plaintiff company 's solicitor in order to obtain his advice were held to be privileged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	690	I need not to go into the facts of the case , which I cite only for the statement of law by Brett LJ at page 320 , which he deduced from the judgments in Anderson v Bank of British Columbia : '' ... it is clear that if a party seeks to inspect a document which comes into existence merely as the materials for the brief , or that which is equivalent to the brief , then the document can not be seen , for it is privileged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	691	It has been urged that the materials , or the information obtained for the brief , should have been obtained ` at the instance ' or ` at the request ' of the solicitor ; but I think it is enough if they come into existence merely as the materials for the brief , and I think that phrase may be enlarged into ` merely for the purpose of being laid before the solicitor for his advice or for his consideration ' '' .

121	693	In the third case , Wheeler v Le Marchant -LRB- 1881 -RRB- 17 Ch D 675 the defendants sought privilege for reports obtained by their solicitors from estate agents/surveyors in the course of previous administration proceedings unconnected with the instant action brought by the plaintiff for specific performance of an agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	694	The Court of Appeal , reversing the order of Bacon V-C , held that the documents were not privileged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	695	Jessel MR at pages 680-1 discussed the limits of the privilege granted to documents obtained by a solicitor from third parties for the purposes of existing or anticipated litigation : `` What they contended for was that documents communicated to the solicitors of the Defendants by third parties , though not communicated by such third parties as agents of the clients seeking advice , should be protected , because those documents contained information required or asked for by the solicitors , for the purpose of enabling them the better to advise the clients . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	696	The cases , no doubt , establish that such documents are protected where they have come into existence after litigation commenced or in contemplation , and when they have been made with a view to such litigation , either for the purpose of obtaining advice as to such litigation , or of obtaining evidence to be used in such litigation , or of obtaining information which might lead to the obtaining of such evidence , but it has never hitherto been decided that documents are protected merely because they are produced by a third person in answer to an inquiry made by the solicitor . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	697	At page 682 he described the rule as being `` established and maintained solely for the purpose of enabling a man to obtain legal advice with safety . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	698	Brett and Cotton LJJ expressed the rule in similar terms , Cotton LJ stating at pages 684-5 : `` Hitherto such communications have only been protected when they have been in contemplation of some litigation , or for the purpose of giving advice or obtaining evidence with reference to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	699	And that is reasonable , because then the solicitor is preparing for the defence or for bringing the action , and all communications he makes for that purpose , and the communications made to him for the purpose of giving him the information , are , in fact , the brief in the action , and ought to be protected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	700	But here we are asked to extend the principle to a very different class of cases , and it is not necessary , in order to enable persons freely to communicate with their solicitors and obtain their legal advice , that any privilege should be extended to communications such as these .

121	702	The limits of this litigation privilege were defined by your Lordships ' House in relatively recent times in Waugh v British Railways Board -LSB- 1980 -RSB- AC 521 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	703	The appeal concerned a report made very shortly after a railway accident , based on a joint internal enquiry conducted by the board 's personnel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott

121	705	The House rejected the claim for privilege , holding that it extended to such documents only if the latter purpose was the dominant one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	706	It was made clear in the speeches given by their Lordships that the context was purely that of what is now termed litigation privilege , not legal advice privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	707	So Lord Edmund-Davies said at page 542 that litigation , apprehended or actual , was the hallmark of this privilege , and that preparation with a view to litigation was the essential purpose which protects a communication from disclosure in such cases .

121	714	The conclusion to be drawn from the trilogy of 19th century cases to which I have referred and the qualifications expressed in the modern case-law is that communications between parties or their solicitors and third parties for the purpose of obtaining information or advice in connection with existing or contemplated litigation are privileged , but only when the following conditions are satisfied : -LRB- a -RRB- litigation must be in progress or in contemplation ; -LRB- b -RRB- the communications must have been made for the sole or dominant purpose of conducting that litigation ; -LRB- c -RRB- the litigation must be adversarial , not investigative or inquisitorial .

121	716	Mr Sumption relied on the cases which I have cited as a foundation for his submission that no fundamental distinction should be drawn between communications in connection with litigation and others . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	717	He submitted that Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead was correct in his statement in Re L -LRB- a minor -RRB- -LSB- 1997 -RSB- AC 16 at 33 when he described the two sub-headings of legal advice privilege and litigation privilege as integral parts of a single privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	718	The only area in which the distinction became relevant was that of third party communications . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	719	Mr Pollock quoted , however , a passage to the opposite effect from the 16th Report of the Law Reform Committee , produced in 1967 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	720	In discussing what in present terminology is legal advice privilege , the Committee stated at paragraph 18 : `` This privilege , which is generally referred to as legal professional privilege , extends to all communications between the client or his agents and the client 's legal advisers made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice other than communications made for the purpose of obtaining advice to enable the client to commit a crime or a fraud . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	721	It differs from the other two kinds of privilege in aid of litigation in that it is not necessary to show that , at the time the advice was sought , any litigation was contemplated by the client in respect of the subject-matter of the advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	722	For this reason , the privilege might also be classified as a privilege in protection of a confidential relationship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	723	Nevertheless , we think that its true rationale is as a privilege in aid of litigation . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	724	It went on to say in paragraph 19 , in a passage relied upon by the Court of Appeal in paragraph 25 of its judgment in the present appeal : `` What distinguishes legal advice from other kinds of professional advice is that it is concerned exclusively with rights and liabilities enforceable in law , i.e. in the ultimate resort by litigation in the courts or in some administrative tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	725	It is , of course , true that on many matters on which a client consults his solicitor he does not expect litigation and certainly hopes that it will not occur ; but there would be no need for him to consult his solicitor to obtain legal advice unless there were some risk of litigation in the future in connection with the matter upon which advice is sought . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	726	As Lord Brougham pointed out , it is to minimise that risk by ensuring that he so conducts his affairs as to make it reasonably certain that he would succeed in any litigation which might be brought in connection with them , that the client consults his solicitor at all . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	727	104 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	728	In so stating the Committee does not appear to have meant merely that the operation of legal professional privilege is restricted to occasions when a party wishes to resist production of documents in litigation in a court of law , for it is apparent from cases such as Parry-Jones v The Law Society -LSB- 1969 -RSB- 1 Ch 1 and R -LRB- on the application of Morgan Grenfell & Co Ltd -RRB- v Special Commissioner of Income Tax -LSB- 2003 -RSB- 1 AC 563 that it may operate in other situations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	729	The approach of the Committee may owe something to the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in Parry-Jones v The Law Society , to which it bears some similarity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	730	In their judgments in that case Lord Denning MR and Diplock LJ -LRB- who was a member of the Law Reform Committee -RRB- confined the definition of legal professional privilege to the principle whereby a party can resist production of documents in a court of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	731	They classified what is now termed legal advice privilege as a confidence which is created by an implied term in the contract between solicitor and client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	732	This restriction of the ambit of legal professional privilege was , however , rejected by Lord Hoffmann , with whom the other members of the House agreed , in the Morgan Grenfell case , when he said at paragraph 30 : `` It is not the case that LPP does no more than entitle the client to require his lawyer to withhold privileged documents in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings , leaving the question of whether he may disclose them on other occasions to the implied duty of confidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	733	The policy of LPP requires that the client should be secure in the knowledge that protected documents and information will not be disclosed at all . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	734	With all respect to the eminence of the jurists who comprised the membership of the Law Reform Committee , accordingly , I think that paragraph 18 of its Report would require to be rephrased in the light of modern case-law and the correctness of the statements in paragraph 19 requires consideration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	735	105 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	736	Mr Sumption submitted , in my opinion correctly , that the cases establish that , so far from legal advice privilege being an outgrowth and extension of litigation privilege , legal professional privilege is a single integral privilege , whose sub-heads are legal advice privilege and litigation privilege , and that it is litigation privilege which is restricted to proceedings in a court of law in the manner which the authorities show . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	737	The conclusions which the Court of Appeal sought in paragraph 25 of its judgment to draw from the authorities cited by it do not appear to me to be well founded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	738	106 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	739	The Court of Appeal also expressed some doubts in paragraph 39 of its judgment about the justification for legal advice privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	740	The Law Society at paragraph 18 of its helpful written case stated : `` In the course of giving instructions to draw a will , confidential information may be given about matrimonial or financial difficulties ; about anticipated inheritance ; about the parentage or adoption of children ; about the perceived unsuitability of a former spouse to act as guardian ; about the physical or mental health of the testator or spouse or other family member ; about pensions , or businesses , or other assets . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	741	If a testator is to be free to supply the frank and full information necessary for the drafting of a will , he must be sure that what he says will remain confidential even though litigation is not ` anticipated ' '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	742	In relation to family matters it stated at note 36 : `` Family lawyers similarly receive a great deal of sensitive information , not only about businesses and assets , but also about family behaviour . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	743	Particularly while taking initial instructions , when litigation may well not be ` anticipated ' , this information can be very wide . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	744	To learn that some or all of this information might not be privileged would not only worry clients but also might lead to a failure to disclose . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	745	One can add to these observations the experience of lawyers who have advised on taxation matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	746	This applies in particular to inheritance tax planning , where the focus is on the disposition of assets and litigation is not in prospect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	747	It is essential that the legal adviser has a complete picture of financial matters , some of which may be highly confidential , especially when dealing with family businesses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	748	Many clients seeking such advice would be very dismayed to think that the information they have made available to their lawyers might not remain confidential . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	749	In my view there is substantial force in the Law Society 's submissions , and a well founded case has been made out for the retention of legal advice privilege in its present form 107 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	750	Mr Sumption then relied on the proposition which I have accepted concerning the basis of legal professional privilege as a foundation for his argument on the main issue to be decided , which is the ambit of the term `` legal advice '' in legal advice privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	751	His contention was that the content of legal advice qualifying for the protection of privilege was the same in respect of both legal advice privilege and litigation privilege and that the creation of a special head for litigation privilege would conflict both with principle and with the authorities .

121	754	In the passage which I have quoted from Greenough v Gaskell -LRB- 1833 -RRB- 1 My & K 98 Lord Brougham LC referred at page 102 to `` matters that come within the ordinary scope of professional employment '' and in Carpmael v Powis -LRB- 1846 -RRB- 1 Ph 687 at 692 Lord Lyndhurst LC used the same phrase and defined it further as `` a transaction in which solicitors are ordinarily employed by their client '' .

121	758	One of the issues was whether conversations between a solicitor and his client relating to the business of obtaining a loan for the deposit on the purchase of real estate were privileged from disclosure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	759	The Court of Appeal held that they were privileged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott

NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	761	This House allowed the plaintiff 's appeal , on the ground that the defendant was not acting as a solicitor at the relevant time because he was not undertaking the duty of a solicitor on the proposal made to him but had made a proposal involving `` a malicious scheme '' -LRB- per Lord Buckmaster at p 569 -RRB- to keep the plaintiff out of the transaction , with a view to making a profit from it himself .

121	763	Lord Buckmaster referred at page 568 to `` the ordinary scope of a solicitor 's business '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	764	Lord Atkin at page 580 spoke of professional communications for the purpose of getting legal advice , but his explanation at page 581 of what is covered by legal advice appears wider than that adopted by the Court of Appeal in the present case : `` If therefore the phrase is expanded to professional communications passing for the purpose of getting or giving professional advice , and it is understood that the profession is the legal profession , the nature of the protection is I think correctly defined . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	765	At pages 584-5 he was more specific , expressing the opinion that : `` If a person goes to a professional legal adviser for the purpose of seeing whether the professional person will give him professional advice , communications made for the purpose of indicating the advice required will be protected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	766	And included in such communications will be those made on occasions such as the present where the parties go to a solicitor for the purpose of seeing whether he will either himself advance or procure some third person to advance a sum of money to carry out the purchase of real property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	767	Such business is professional business , and communications made for its purpose appear to me to be covered by the protection , whether the solicitor eventually accedes to the request or not . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	768	110 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	769	Other decided cases are reviewed by Taylor LJ in Balabel v Air India -LSB- 1988 -RSB- Ch 317 , but it is always necessary to take account of the context in which such statements were made , for the ambit of legal advice may not have been in issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	770	111 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	771	The issue in Balabel v Air India was whether the plaintiffs , who had sued the defendant airline for specific performance of an agreement for an underlease , could obtain discovery of various documents generated by the airline and its solicitors relating to the proposed underlease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	772	After examining the authorities in detail , Taylor LJ said at page 330 : `` Although originally confined to advice regarding litigation , the privilege was extended to non-litigious business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	773	Nevertheless , despite that extension , the purpose and scope of the privilege is still to enable legal advice to be sought and given in confidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	774	In my judgment , therefore , the test is whether the communication or other document was made confidentially for the purposes of legal advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	775	Those purposes have to be construed broadly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	776	Privilege obviously attaches to a document conveying legal advice from solicitor to client and to a specific request from the client for such advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	777	But it does not follow that all other communications between them lack privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	778	In most solicitor and client relationships , especially where a transaction involves protracted dealings , advice may be required or appropriate on matters great or small at various stages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	779	There will be a continuum of communication and meetings between the solicitor and client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	780	... Where information is passed by the solicitor or client to the other as part of the continuum aimed at keeping both informed so that advice may be sought and given as required , privilege will attach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	781	A letter from the client containing information may end with such words as ` please advise me what I should do ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	782	But , even if it does not , there will usually be implied in the relationship an overall expectation that the solicitor will at each stage , whether asked specifically or not , tender appropriate advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	783	Moreover , legal advice is not confined to telling the client the law ; it must include advice as to what should prudently and sensibly be done in the relevant legal context . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	784	In a later passage at pages 331-2 relied upon by the Court of Appeal as support for its conclusions Taylor LJ stated : `` It follows from this analysis that those dicta in the decided cases which appear to extend privilege without limit to all solicitor and client communications upon matters within the ordinary business of a solicitor and referable to that relationship are too wide . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	785	It may be that the broad terms used in the earlier cases reflect the restricted range of solicitors ' activities at the time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	786	Their role then would have been confined for the most part to that of lawyer and would not have extended to business adviser or man of affairs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	787	To speak therefore of matters ` within the ordinary business of a solicitor ' would in practice usually have meant the giving of advice and assistance of a specifically legal nature . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	788	But the range of assistance given by solicitors to their clients and of activities carried out on their behalf has greatly broadened in recent times and is still developing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	789	Hence the need to re-examine the scope of legal professional privilege and keep it within justifiable bounds . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	790	I agree with the view expressed by Colman J in Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep Holding NV v Bacon & Woodrow Holding -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 1 All ER 976 at 982 that the statement of the law in Balabel v Air India does not disturb or modify the principle affirmed in Minter v Priest , that all communications between a solicitor and his client relating to a transaction in which the solicitor has been instructed for the purpose of obtaining legal advice will be privileged , notwithstanding that they do not contain advice on matters of law or construction , provided that they are directly related to the performance by the solicitor of his professional duty as legal adviser of his client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	791	112 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	792	There must , as Taylor LJ said , be limits to the scope of privilege , but in my opinion the Court of Appeal has set them too tightly in concluding that it is confined to advice relating to the legal rights and obligations of the client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	793	It has , I think , been too restrictive in its view , perhaps because of the doubts expressed by the Master of the Rolls about the justification for legal advice privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	794	It is of course important not to permit a party to withhold production of information which may be of significant importance when the court is reaching its decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	795	As Bingham LJ put it in Ventouris v Mountain -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 607 at 612 : '' ... disclosure being generally regarded as beneficial , any exception has to be justified as serving the public interest which gives rise to the exception . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	796	In this connection it is worth quoting the remarks of Knight Bruce V-C in Pearse v Pearse -LRB- 1846 -RRB- 1 De G & Sm 12 at 28-9 , which , expressed in the style of the times , seem to me to retain considerable validity : `` The discovery and vindication and establishment of truth are main purposes certainly of the existence of Courts of Justice ; still , for the obtaining of these objects , which , however valuable and important , can not be usefully pursued without moderation , can not be either usefully or creditably pursued unfairly or gained by unfair means , not every channel is or ought to be open to them ... Truth , like all other good things , may be loved unwisely - may be pursued too keenly - may cost too much . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	797	And surely the meanness and the mischief of prying into a man 's confidential communications with his legal adviser , the general evil of infusing reserve and dissimulation , uneasiness , and suspicion and fear , into those communications which must take place , and which , unless in a condition of perfect security , must take place uselessly or worse , are too great a price to pay for truth itself . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	798	Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead summarised the same principle in more sober modern legal parlance in Re L -LRB- a minor -RRB- -LSB- 1997 -RSB- AC 16 when he said at page 32 : `` The public interest in a party being able to obtain informed legal advice in confidence prevails over the public interest in all relevant material being available to courts when deciding cases .

121	800	The question for decision is where the line is to be drawn and the bounds of privilege are to be set . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	801	It is unquestionable that the breadth of work commonly carried out by lawyers has increased since the early 19th century . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	802	The increase in the number and variety of tribunals other than courts of law has been marked in recent years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	803	Statutory and non-statutory inquiries and investigations have proliferated , as HM Government set out in its written case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	804	The consequences of findings in inquiries such as the Bingham Inquiry may , as I have earlier outlined , be serious for some of the persons or bodies to whom they relate , and investigations such as those held under the Companies Act 1985 can have a substantial effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	805	It may be of considerable importance for those who may be affected to ensure that their case is put before the inquiry in as effective a manner as possible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	806	The Court of Appeal stated in paragraph 33 of its judgment that a desire to protect reputation to avoid more intrusive regulation does not put the Bank on the same footing as an individual whose reputation is at risk in a public inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	807	That may be so , but I can not agree that the Bank should for that reason be deprived of any protection of legal professional privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	808	Its interests may differ from those of individuals whose conduct is called in question , but it does not follow that they are to be disregarded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott

121	810	The work of advising a client on the most suitable approach to adopt , assembling material for presentation of his case and taking statements which set out the relevant material in an orderly fashion and omit the irrelevant is to my mind the classic exercise of one of the lawyer 's skills . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	811	I can see no valid reason why that should cease to be so because the forum is an inquiry or other tribunal which is not a court of law , provided that the advice is given in a legal context : see Lord Scott 's opinion at para 42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott

121	813	The availability of competent legal advice will materially assist an inquiry by reducing irrelevance and encouraging the making of proper admissions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	814	As Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers himself expressed it in his Chairman 's Note on Lawyers in connection with the BSE tribunal : `` Lawyers are experienced in gathering documentary evidence and have the skills essential to ensure that witness statements cover the relevant ground , without becoming unnecessarily prolix . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	815	Dr Johnson described the function of lawyers , as Lord Simon of Glaisdale felicitously recalled in Waugh v British Railways Board -LSB- 1980 -RSB- AC 521 at 535 , in the following terms : `` As it rarely happens that a man is fit to plead his own cause , lawyers are a class of the community who , by study and experience , have acquired the art and power of arranging evidence , and of applying to the points at issue what the law has settled . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	816	A lawyer is to do for his client all that his client might fairly do for himself , if he could . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	817	The Court of Appeal acknowledged at paragraph 34 of its judgment that the role of Freshfields in assisting with the preparation of evidence and submissions for the Bingham Inquiry was very similar to that which a solicitor plays in relation to litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	818	It is an exercise in advocacy and good advocacy will be adapted to the tribunal concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott

121	820	An inquest is a case in point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	821	The findings may not now have the legal consequences which they formerly could have , but , as Lord Bingham of Cornhill stated in R -LRB- on the application of Amin -RRB- v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 1 AC 653 at paragraph 31 , the inquest may have a vital function in exposing culpable and discreditable conduct : cf the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Jordan v United Kingdom -LRB- 2001 -RRB- 11 BHRC 1 and the discussion in the speech of Lord Bingham of Cornhill in R -LRB- on the application of Middleton -RRB- v West Somerset Coroner -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 2 AC 182 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	822	It is difficult to suppose that those whose conduct is investigated under such a searching light should be deprived of the protection of legal professional privilege when they obtain advice and assistance from their lawyers about how to proceed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	823	116 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	824	I therefore conclude that there is a clear case for upholding the appellant Bank 's submission that privilege attached to communications between the BIU and Freshfields by which the advice and assistance of Freshfields was sought and obtained as to the manner in which the Bank should appropriately present evidence and material to the Bingham Inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	825	To repeat the phrase of Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead , the public interest in the Bank 's being able to obtain legal advice in confidence prevails over the public interest in all relevant material being available to the inquiry when reaching its conclusions .

121	830	One other matter remains for mention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	831	Mr Sumption urged that we should express an opinion on the correctness of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Three Rivers -LRB- No 5 -RRB- , which he submitted raised important issues about privilege which should be resolved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	832	The Court of Appeal in that case found against the Bank and your Lordships refused the Bank 's petition for leave to appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	833	Disclosure of large numbers of documents has been made in accordance with the order of the Court of Appeal and Mr Sumption gave an undertaking on behalf of the Bank that , if the House were to rule that the decision of the Court of Appeal was incorrect , the documents already disclosed will continue to be admissible in the present action and no point will be taken about the judge having seen them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	834	I should be reluctant , in the absence of a very pressing need , to express an opinion on issues which are not before the House - even though we permitted some argument on them to be put before us - the more so when leave to appeal was refused . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	835	For that reason , and for those given by my noble and learned friend Lord Scott of Foscote in discussing this issue , I do not propose to express any opinion on it . 	lord carswell	lord scott	fullagr	1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott

121	843	I think it clear that legal advice privilege attaches to the communications between the Bank and its lawyers concerning the preparation of the Bank 's overarching statement -LRB- the statement of its case to the Bingham inquiry -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	844	I would go so far as to state as a general principle that the process by which a client seeks and obtains his lawyer 's assistance in the presentation of his case for the purposes of any formal inquiry -- whether concerned with public law or private law issues , whether adversarial or inquisitorial in form , whether held in public or in private , whether or not directly affecting his rights or liabilities -- attracts legal advice privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	845	Such assistance to my mind clearly has the character of legal business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	846	It is precisely the sort of professional service for which lawyers are ordinarily employed by virtue of their expertise and experience . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	847	Indeed , it falls squarely within Dr Johnson 's description of a lawyer 's function -- see Lord Carswell 's speech at paragraph 114 . 	lord brown	lord carswell	partagr	1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	848	It is , moreover , a service which can only effectively be rendered if the client is candid and forthcoming as to the true facts of his case -- the very consideration which justifies the absolute character of legal advice privilege in the first place .

121	850	The Court of Appeal in Three Rivers District Council v Governor and Company of the Bank of England -LRB- No. 6 -RRB- -LSB- 2004 -RSB- QB 916 -LRB- Three Rivers -LRB- No. 6 -RRB- -RRB- to my mind adopted too narrow an approach to the scope of legal advice privilege , holding as it did that the privilege applies only where the client 's legal rights and liabilities are at stake , seldom therefore in relation to an inquiry , perhaps not even where the inquiry puts the client 's reputation at risk -- a question expressly left undecided . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	851	But consider an inquiry where the client receives and must respond to a Salmon letter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	852	Can the tribunal then insist on seeing the communications between the client and his lawyer by which the terms of his response come to be settled ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	853	Surely not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	854	Rather this would seem to me a classic case for the application of the privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown, lord carswell, lord rodger, lord scott
121	855	And by the same token that legal advice privilege must in my judgment apply to someone whose reputation is at stake , so too should it apply to anyone who instructs lawyers with a view to making the best presentation of his case at an inquiry .
