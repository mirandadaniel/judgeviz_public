25	5	This appeal raises an important question as to the capacity and functions of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission set up by section 68 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 -LRB- `` the 1998 Act '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
25	6	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
25	7	The question arises out of an inquest held by Her Majesty 's Coroner for the district of Fermanagh and Tyrone into the deaths of victims of the bomb explosion in Omagh on 15 August 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
25	8	Two matters became relevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
25	9	The first was whether the Coroner should order pre-inquest disclosure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
25	10	The Coroner by letter dated 16 August 2000 asked whether the Commission wished to make a formal submission on human rights issues connected with that matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
25	11	The Commission prepared a skeleton argument on that and was represented by counsel at a hearing on 6 September 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
25	12	Following representations on behalf of the next of kin , the Coroner exercised his discretion to order pre-trial discovery and so he did not call on the Commission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
25	13	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
25	14	The second matter concerned the scope of the inquest 's remit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
25	15	On 12 September the Commission wrote to the Coroner stating that in the opinion of the Commission `` there may be human rights principles arising in respect of these matters on which it would be appropriate for the Commission to make submissions '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
25	16	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
25	17	In the meantime the Coroner had told the Commission that the latter would be provided with transcripts since he was `` satisfied '' that the Commission 's status equated `` to that of a properly interested person '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
25	18	The Commission noticed that in the only skeleton argument prepared on behalf of some of the relatives there was no consideration of applicable human rights standards . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
25	19	Following correspondence and oral submissions as to whether the Commission had power to intervene , the Coroner on 27 September 2000 ruled that the Commission had no statutory power to intervene and that accordingly he could not permit it to intervene . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
25	20	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
25	21	The Commission challenged the Coroner 's decision pursuant to Order 53 Rule 3 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Rules of the Supreme Court -LRB- Northern Ireland -RRB- 1980 , asking for a declaration that the Coroner 's decision -LRB- to the effect that the Commission had no power or standing to intervene in proceedings so that it could not be permitted to intervene at the inquest -RRB- was wrong in law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
25	22	It was contended on behalf of the Commission that -LRB- a -RRB- the Commission could apply to intervene and -LRB- b -RRB- that the Court could permit the Commission to intervene for the purpose of making submissions and representations concerning human rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
25	23	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	24	Sir Robert Carswell LCJ on 8 December 2000 considered that he was impelled to uphold the Coroner 's ruling and he refused to make the declarations sought . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	25	The Court of Appeal by a majority -LRB- McCollum LJ and Sir John MacDermott , Kerr J dissenting -RRB- dismissed the Commission 's appeal -LRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- NI 271 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	26	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	27	The Lord Chief Justice had agreed to hear the matter even though the Coroner 's inquest had gone ahead whilst the proceedings for judicial review were on foot and at a time when no substantive relief could be granted ; the Court of Appeal agreed and in my view the Lord Chief Justice was plainly right to take this course . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	28	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	29	The argument has focused on the provisions of the 1998 Act , the long title of which is `` to make new provision for the government of Northern Ireland for the purpose of implementing the agreement reached at multi-party talks on Northern Ireland set out in Command Paper 3883 '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	30	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	31	Section 68 of the Act provided for the creation of the Commission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	32	This was to take the place of the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights which was constituted under the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 and whose functions were those of advising and informing the Secretary of State as to the adequacy and effectiveness of the law in preventing discrimination on the ground of religious belief or political opinion and certain related matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	33	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	34	The powers of the Commission are on any view far more extensive than those of the Standing Advisory Commission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	35	In the first place there is an overarching duty to `` keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness in Northern Ireland of law and practice relating to the protection of human rights '' -LRB- section 69 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	36	To that end the Commission is within two years to make recommendations to the Secretary of State as to improving the Commission 's effectiveness and as to the adequacy and effectiveness of its functions -LRB- section 69 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	37	It is required to advise the Secretary of State and the Executive Committee of the Assembly of legislative and other measures which ought to be taken to protect human rights either when asked to advise or on its own initiative -LRB- section 69 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	38	It is empowered to advise the Assembly whether a Bill is compatible with human rights -LRB- section 69 -LRB- 4 -RRB- -RRB- to provide advice of the kind referred to in paragraph 4 of the Human Rights section of the Belfast Agreement -LRB- section 69 -LRB- 7 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	39	It has an obligation to `` promote understanding and awareness of the importance of human rights in Northern Ireland '' -LRB- section 69 -LRB- 6 -RRB- -RRB- and for that purpose it can provide assistance for research and educational activities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	40	More specifically in relation to the courts the Commission is empowered by subsection -LRB- 5 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of section 69 to give assistance to individuals in accordance with section 70 where proceedings involving the law and practice relating to human rights in Northern Ireland are involved , and where the Commission considers that a question of principle is involved or where there are special circumstances in which the Commission thinks it appropriate to provide assistance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	41	Such assistance may take the form of legal advice , representation or any other assistance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	42	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	43	Even closer to the question now raised is the provision in subsection -LRB- 5 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- that the Commission may `` bring proceedings involving law or practice relating to the protection of human rights '' though that provision does not enable proceedings to be brought on the ground that legislation or an act is incompatible with a Convention right unless the Commission would be a `` victim '' for the purpose of proceedings brought in the European Court of Human Rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	44	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	45	Since the Act is `` for the purpose of implementing '' the Belfast Agreement it is relevant to note the emphasis on the `` protection and vindication of the human rights of all '' in para . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	46	2 of the Declaration of Support in the Agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	47	There will , by para . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	48	5 of Strand One of the Agreement , be safeguards to ensure that all sections of the community are protected , including -LRB- b -RRB- the European Convention on Human Rights and any Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland supplementing it , which neither the Assembly nor public bodies can infringe , together with a Human Rights Commission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	49	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	50	By paragraph 5 of the section in Strand Three dealing with `` New Institutions in Northern Ireland '' -LRB- page 17 -RRB- it is provided that the Commission will be established with an extended and enhanced role beyond that of the Standing Advisory Commission including `` keeping under review the adequacy and effectiveness of laws and practices , making recommendations to Government as necessary ; providing information and promoting awareness of human rights ; considering draft legislation referred to them by the new Assembly ; and , in appropriate cases , bringing court proceedings or providing assistance to individuals doing so . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	51	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	52	The Lord Chief Justice accepted that a Coroner had power in principle to permit a person to intervene in an appropriate case and to ask for the assistance of an amicus curiae though the position of the intervener and the amicus had to be distinguished . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	53	He was not satisfied that under the Coroners -LRB- Practice and Procedure -RRB- Rules -LRB- Northern Ireland -RRB- 1963 -LRB- rule 7 -RRB- the Commission could properly be regarded as having a status which `` equates to that of a properly interested person '' with the power to examine witnesses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	54	His view was that as a statutory body the Commission `` has only the powers conferred by statute upon it , which will include such powers as may fairly -LSB- be -RSB- regarded as incidental to or consequential upon those things which the legislature has authorised : cf Attorney-General v Great Eastern Railway Co. -LRB- 1880 -RRB- 5 App Cas 473 at 478 , per Lord Selborne L.C. ; Wade & Forsyth , Administrative Law 7th Ed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	55	p. 219 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	56	In order fairly to be regarded as incidental , those powers , if not expressly conferred , must be derived by reasonable implication from the provisions of the legislation : Baroness Wenlock v River Dee Co. -LRB- 1885 -RRB- 10 App . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	57	Cas 354 at 362-3 , per Lord Watson ; and cf. Lord Macnaghten 's remarks in Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants v Osborne -LSB- 1910 -RSB- AC 87 at 97 . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	58	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	59	Even with as broad and sympathetic construction as they would reasonably bear , the Lord Chief Justice was unable to find `` anything in the section which confers powers on the Commission to make submissions to courts and tribunals about the content of the law relating to human rights or its application to a particular case . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	60	-LRB- p. 10 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	61	He considered that none of the specific provisions of section 69 could be read so as to include such an implied power . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	62	In particular subsection -LRB- 6 -RRB- concerned with the promotion of understanding and awareness of the importance of human rights was `` a proselytising function '' and not an advocacy function like the role of an intervener or the non-partisan advisory function of the amicus . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	63	He had been asked to have regard to statements in Parliament , but though having doubts as to whether it was permissible to look at these following Pepper -LRB- Inspector of Taxes -RRB- v Hart -LSB- 1993 -RSB- AC 593 he did not consider that they threw any light on the question whether the Commission had a statutory power to make submissions to the Court if permitted to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	64	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	65	In the Court of Appeal McCollum L.J. whilst accepting that it was right not to interpret the 1998 Act narrowly or restrictively ruled that `` the provisions of the Act investing powers in the Commission must be looked at in the light of the stated objectives of the Act and in sympathy with its general import , but that does not enable a court to read something into the provisions which has not been enacted or to add to them at will '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	66	To allow the Commission to intervene in proceedings in which it had no direct interest as a party had one of two objectives . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
25	67	`` Either it is not calculated to affect the outcome , in which case it is irrelevant , or it is calculated to affect the outcome , in which case a number of potentially undesirable results may ensue '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	68	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	69	Thus , the public perception might be that the court was influenced by a government agency not a party to the proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	70	Costs would be increased . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	71	The party against whose stance the Commission argued would feel aggrieved by the inequality of arms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	72	Moreover it was undesirable that the Commission should be involved in controversy in the course of a case to which it was not a party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	73	`` The concept of human rights itself and the interpretation of the Human Rights Convention or the Human Rights Act 1998 are not matters which should give a great deal of difficulty to a court . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN

25	76	He considered that the Commission would not be likely to have the necessary disinterested quality that one seeks in an amicus curiae . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	77	The principal ground for his decision was , however , that none of the specific provisions could be read as impliedly giving a right to intervene or to appear as an amicus . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	78	If Parliament had intended such a power it would have said so expressly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	79	Other statutes where intervention had been permitted were distinguishable in that they contained a wider general power than the specific powers given under section 69 of the 1998 Act -- eg . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	80	R v DPP ex parte Duckenfield -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 All ER 873 -LRB- section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Police Act 1996 and section 111 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Local Government Act 1972 -RRB- ; and Re F -LRB- Mental Patient : Sterilisation -RRB- -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 1 and R v Bournewood Community and Mental Health NHS Trust , ex parte L -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 1 AC 458 under section 120 of the Mental Health Act 1983 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	81	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	82	Sir John MacDermott agreed with the reasoning of McCollum L.J. . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	83	He found it significant that the Commission had not been given the powers of the Equal Opportunities Commission which the House had held gave it the right to intervene -LRB- Equal Opportunities Commission v Secretary of State for Employment -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 1 AC 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	84	The Belfast Agreement did not indicate that such a power was intended and it was significant that section 69 -LRB- 5 -RRB- and para . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	85	5 of the Agreement referred only to `` bringing proceedings '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	86	Although interested bodies increasingly had been allowed to make submissions `` it seems to me however that though a court should feel free to seek assistance in whatever manner and from whoever has the appropriate expertise that fact can not of itself create in statutory bodies the right to respond '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	87	He thought in any event that the fact that the Attorney General could also be asked to appoint an amicus -LRB- semble other than the Commission -RRB- would avoid any difficulties which the court might face . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	88	It was for him significant that the Republic of Ireland had expressly granted the power to appear as an amicus whereas nothing had been said in the 1998 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	89	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	90	I recognise the force of the reasoning of these three judgments and of the objections to the Commission 's having the power to intervene which are raised by my noble and learned friend Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough . 	lord slynn	lord hobhouse	partagr	0.2	NAN
25	91	It has to be accepted that neither in the Belfast Agreement nor in the 1998 Act is there an express provision that the Commission may intervene in proceedings or appear as an amicus curiae even when human rights issues are under discussion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	92	It is also clear that a statutory body usually has only the powers conferred on it by statute and I am prepared in this appeal to assume that such a rule applies even to a body with special powers and duties like the Commission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	93	Such powers can however equally clearly include such powers as may fairly be regarded as incidental to or consequential upon those things which the legislature has authorised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	94	Attorney General v Great Eastern Railway Co. -LRB- supra -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	95	I accept that there will be statutes in which the express powers in a particular context are drawn so tightly that it would be wrong to read in other powers which could easily have been expressly included and where the proper inference is that they were deliberately left out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	96	I also agree with Sir John MacDermott that one should not begin with the assumption that because `` the Commission should have such a power it must have it and the statutory provisions must be read accordingly '' -LRB- p. 299 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	97	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	98	The Lord Chief Justice -LRB- followed by the majority in the Court of Appeal -RRB- examined literally and in detail the provisions of the subsections of section 69 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	99	He found that the duty under subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- to `` keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice relating to the protection of human rights '' could not of itself give a power to address submissions to a court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	100	I agree that it does not expressly say so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	101	It does , however , indicate the importance of the Commission in developing such law and practice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	102	The organ most concerned with the interpretation and enforcement of human rights law and practice once incorporated by statute is the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	103	Submissions by the Commission as to how the human rights law should be interpreted and applied so as to be adequate and effective show how relevant is the work of the Commission to that of the courts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	104	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	105	Sub-sections -LRB- 2 -RRB- , -LRB- 3 -RRB- and -LRB- 4 -RRB- lay down the duty to give the Secretary of State and the Assembly advice and I agree with the Lord Chief Justice that in themselves they do nothing directly to support the Commission 's case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	106	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	107	It has to be accepted that Sub-section -LRB- 5 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- in itself is limited to giving financial and other assistance to individuals in accordance with section 70 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	108	Moreover Sub-section -LRB- 5 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- refers to `` bring -LSB- ing -RSB- proceedings '' which as the Lord Chief Justice said is not apposite to an inquisitorial inquest before a Coroner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	109	Both Sub-sections however indicate a role for the Commission in connection with court proceedings even though in respect of proceedings in which it is sought to contend that legislation is incompatible with the European Human Rights Convention they can only be brought , it seems , if the Commission can show that it is a victim for the purposes of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	110	These provisions , even though do not expressly confer the power to intervene do not , it seems to me , rule out the possibility of the Commission having a role in court proceedings as intervener or as amicus if such role is incidental to express powers which are given . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	111	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
25	112	The Commission has relied most strongly on sub-section -LRB- 6 -RRB- -LRB- to `` promote -LSB- understanding -RSB- and -LSB- awareness of the importance -RSB- of human rights in Northern Ireland '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	113	I have put these two parts of the provision in square brackets because it seems to me they must be read disjunctively . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	114	Again read literally they do not express a right to intervene or to appear as amicus . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	115	I do not , however , agree that this is , as the Lord Chief Justice accepted , merely a `` proselytising function '' which is inapplicable in courts which are assumed to know that human rights are important . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	116	Whether as amicus curiae , keeping within the limits of a non-partisan view of the particular case , or advocating as intervener where there is a danger that an important principle of law favouring one party or the other has not been brought to the attention of the court , the Commission would have the possibility of promoting understanding by the courts of human rights law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	117	Courts can gain much from such interventions as the House did in R v Kansal -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 3 WLR 1562 even if the arguments in the end were not accepted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	118	Thus whilst recognising that this gives no express right it seems to me to be a strong pointer to a function incidental to the Commission 's primary duty or power . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	119	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	120	Accordingly I agree with Kerr J. that the combination of subsections 69 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , -LRB- 5 -RRB- , -LRB- 6 -RRB- and -LRB- 8 -RRB- indicate the conferring on the Commission of general powers to promote the understanding of human rights law and practice and to review its adequacy and effectiveness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	121	The capacity to make -LRB- not a power to insist on making -RRB- submissions to the court are incidental to this general power . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	122	The fact that the question is concerned with capacity rather than power in my view is important . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	123	The final decision lies with the court which can allow or refuse the Commission 's application to intervene , invite or not ask for help from the Commission as amicus curiae . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	124	The provision that the Commission shall promote understanding of human rights law has thus to be read in this context subject to the court 's control of its procedure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	125	If the court wants or is willing to have such submissions the Commission has the capacity to make them as part of the function of promoting the understanding of human rights law , particularly if reference has to be made to some of the many decisions of the European Court of Human Rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	126	I am not troubled by the floodgates argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	127	The Commission must exercise caution in deciding whether a case is important enough to justify intervention or assistance ; and whether there is a risk of particular parties or one party feeling that it is unfair that the Commission should come down on one side rather than the other in the legal argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	128	It is in the end for the court to decide these matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	129	The courts will only allow or invite assistance when they feel it necessary or helpful ; with increasing knowledge particularly of cases in the European Court of Human Rights they may find it less necessary but this capacity to give assistance to the court is potentially valuable in achieving the purpose of the legislation In my view the existence of that capacity is reasonably incidental to its main express powers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	130	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	131	I have not found it necessary to refer to the extracts from Hansard in order to resolve the question on this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	132	I do not however see that the Government 's position in what is said there is inconsistent with my conclusions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	133	Mr McNamara MP 's amendment to the Clause which was later section 69 of the Act , would have avoided , at any rate in part , the issue in this appeal since it would have said expressly that with the leave of the court the Commission could submit an opinion as amicus curiae . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	134	One reason he gave was that that `` would enable it more effectively to carry out the advisory and educational functions envisaged in the Agreement '' -LRB- Hansard 27 July 1998 Col. 78 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	135	The Minister Mr Paul Murphy MP both on that occasion and on 18 November expressed the Government 's view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	136	On 18 November 1998 he said `` Courts will be free to ask the Commission to provide assistance as amicus under the normal rules that apply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	137	However , that is not a matter for the Bill , but for the court in individual cases '' -LRB- Hansard 18 November 1998 , Col. 1061 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
25	138	In the House of Lords the Lord Chancellor said `` The European Court of Human Rights rules of procedure allow non-parties such as national and international non-governmental organisations to make written submissions in the form of a brief . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

25	159	I am , however , acutely conscious that together with the majority of your Lordships I am disagreeing with the views of Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough , the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland and the majority of the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland . 	lord woolf	lord hobhouse	fulldisa	0.4	NAN
25	160	Furthermore we are doing so as to the interpretation of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 , which was enacted in particularly sensitive political circumstances , in relation to the powers of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	161	I therefore propose to set out shortly my reasons for coming to the same conclusion as the majority of your lordships . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	162	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	163	If the Commission has the power to intervene in legal proceedings , then it is common ground that this is not a power expressly conferred by the 1998 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	164	The issue is whether the Commission has an implicit power to intervene . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	165	I suppose it is right to regard this as an issue of interpretation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	166	However , it is not an issue which involves deciding what is the true effect of statutory provisions which are obscure as to their meaning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	167	The language of the sections -LRB- primarily section 69 -RRB- of the 1998 Act with which we are concerned is perfectly clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	168	The task involves deciding whether in view of the express powers clearly conferred on the Commission it is right to conclude that the Commission has an implicit power to intervene in legal proceedings if the court conducting the proceedings agrees that it should do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	169	As Lord Slynn and Lord Hutton both point out , the answer to the issue depends on whether the power can be fairly regarded as incidental to or consequential upon the powers which the legislature has expressly conferred . 	lord woolf	lord slynn	partagr	0.4	NAN
25	169	As Lord Slynn and Lord Hutton both point out , the answer to the issue depends on whether the power can be fairly regarded as incidental to or consequential upon the powers which the legislature has expressly conferred . 	lord woolf	lord hutton	partagr	0.4	NAN
25	170	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	171	Deciding whether the power to intervene in legal proceedings is to be regarded as incidental or consequential involves , not only considering individually each of the possibly relevant express powers , it also involves considering those powers as a whole . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	172	In addition it is necessary to identify the purposes for which this body was established by the legislature . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	173	The task was correctly approached by Kerr J in his dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	174	Having asked himself the right question he came to the conclusion that the general nature of the Commission?s role included the promotion of human rights and that the power to intervene when permitted to do so in legal proceedings was an implicit part of that role . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	175	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	176	The practice of allowing third persons to intervene in proceedings brought by and against other persons which do not directly involve the person seeking to intervene has become more common in recent years but it is still a relatively a rare event . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	177	The intervention is always subject to the control of the court and whether the third person is allowed by the court to intervene is usually dependent upon the court 's judgment as to whether the interests of justice will be promoted by allowing the intervention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	178	Frequently the answer will depend upon whether the intervention will assist the court itself to perform the role upon which it is engaged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	179	The court has always to balance the benefits which are to be derived from the intervention as against the inconvenience , delay and expense which an intervention by a third person can cause to the existing parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	180	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	181	While it is common to confer an express power on a body such as the Commission to bring proceedings I would find it surprising if an express power to exercise this novel role of intervening should be conferred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	182	However , I would find it extraordinary if a body having the express powers of the Commission did not have the ability to intervene . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	183	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	184	The successful introduction of human rights into the domestic law of the United Kingdom is substantially dependent upon the courts giving proper effect to those rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	185	This is a challenging and difficult new undertaking for the courts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	186	The Commission should be in a position to give substantial assistance to enable the courts to fully appreciate what is involved in properly applying human rights in the litigation which comes before them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	187	I find it hard to believe that it could have been the intention of Parliament that the Commission should not be in a position to proffer assistance when the court wishes to have that assistance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	188	The Commission?s express power to bring proceedings itself in section 69 -LRB- 5 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- is as to issues `` involving law or practice relating to the protection of human rights '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	189	The Commission also has been granted an extensive power to provide assistance to others in relation to legal proceedings in cases raising questions of a principle as to human rights -LRB- section 70 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	190	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	191	Bearing in mind these greater powers I regard it inevitable that the more limited power to intervene should be regarded as implicit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	192	While I agree with Lord Hobhouse that it is important to have fully in mind the sensitive background to the passing of the 1998 Act , the existence of this restricted power to intervene , the exercise of which will be carefully controlled by the courts , should not be of any `` political '' significance . 	lord woolf	lord hobhouse	partagr	0.4	NAN

25	194	If a power to intervene exists then the nature of the tribunal does not affect the existence of the power . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	195	Nothing in my judgment turns on the fact that we are here concerned with a possible intervention in an inquest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
25	196	The limits on the power are in the hands of the courts before whom the Commission wishes to appear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

25	208	With great respect to the contrary opinion of the Lord Chief Justice and the majority of the Court of Appeal , I am unable to accept that Parliament would have authorised the Commission to publish the outcome of its investigations into such matters without intending that the Commission should have the capacity to present its conclusions directly to the courts if so requested . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
25	209	Conversely , I can not accept that a court , wishing to know the views of the Commission about the human rights implications of the case before it , and to allow the parties to question those views , was intended by Parliament to be denied the power of inviting the Commission to be represented , and to be left to rely upon such help as it could get from the Commission 's published reports . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
25	210	It may well be that the power would rarely be exercised , but its existence , and the corresponding capacity of the Commission to respond , seem to me to be established by reasonable implication from the express provisions of section 69 -LRB- 8 -RRB- and -LRB- 9 -RRB- , as well as being incidental to the other provisions of the section .

25	272	It appears to me that the powers granted by the 1998 Act either to bring proceedings in its own name or to give assistance to individuals engaged in proceedings are quite adequate to ensure that the Commission is able to make a substantial contribution to the observance of human rights in Northern Ireland and to the involvement of the courts in that process . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
25	273	Sir John MacDermott referred to the provisions of section 69 and stated at p 298 : `` I can not find in those provisions or elsewhere in the 1998 Act any express power authorising the Commission to participate in court proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
25	274	Mr Macdonald disputed that conclusion when expressed by the Lord Chief Justice on the ground that it flew in the face of the very purpose for which the Commission was created -- namely to promote human rights issues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
25	275	The Commission may , perhaps , feel somewhat inhibited or frustrated by the absence of such a power but it must recognise that its powers are such as Parliament from time to time grants to it . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
25	276	And at p 299 : `` Can a power to participate in court proceedings be derived from the Act by ` reasonable implication ' ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
25	277	Mr Macdonald 's argument was , in essence , a claim that as the Commission should have such a power it must have it and the statutory provisions must be read accordingly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
25	278	Such an approach has undertones of the belief that ` words mean what I want them to mean ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
25	279	But that approach is not an acceptable approach to statutory interpretation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
25	280	The Parliamentary draftsman 's duty is , in so far as is possible , to express the will of Parliament in clear terms and the final version , after all amendments are absorbed , expresses the intention of Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
25	281	Just as I am satisfied that the Commission has been granted no express power to participate in court proceedings I am equally satisfied that no such power can be gleaned by ` reasonable implication ' . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
25	282	In his dissenting judgment Kerr J stated at p 294 : `` At the kernel of this debate , in my opinion , is whether any ` overall function ' was conferred on the Commission by s 69 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
25	283	The Lord Chief Justice concluded that no explicit statutory expression of such a general function is to be found in the section . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
25	284	It appears to me , however , that the import of s 69 is to provide the Commission with an overarching role in the promotion and safeguarding of human rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
25	285	That is achieved by giving a number of functions to the Commission , some specific and some general . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
25	286	... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
25	287	In my opinion , by providing general powers to the Commission and allowing it a wide discretion as to how some of those powers should be exercised , Parliament must be taken to have intended that the Commission should perform an overall role in relation to the observance of human rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
25	288	This may not have been spelled out in express statutory language as in the Sex Discrimination Act -LSB- 1975 -RSB- but the general nature of the Commission 's role in the promotion of human rights is unmistakable , in my view . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
25	289	And at p 296 : `` If , contrary to my view , the commission is not expressly authorised to apply to intervene in proceedings , I consider that the power to do so should be recognised as incidental to or consequential upon its general duty to promote the observance of human rights -- A-G v Great Eastern Railway Co -LRB- 1880 -RRB- 5 App Cas 473 .

25	291	In Baroness Wenlock v River Dee Company -LRB- 1885 -RRB- 10 App Cas 354 , 362-3 Lord Watson , stating the principle earlier recognised by this House in Attorney-General v Great Eastern Railway Company -LRB- 1880 -RRB- 5 App Cas 473 , said : `` Whenever a corporation is created by Act of Parliament , with reference to the purposes of the Act , and solely with a view to carrying these purposes into execution , I am of opinion not only that the objects which the corporation may legitimately pursue must be ascertained from the Act itself , but that the powers which the corporation may lawfully use in furtherance of these objects must either be expressly conferred or derived by reasonable implication from its provisions .

25	292	52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	293	In their judgments the Lord Chief Justice and the majority of the Court of Appeal carefully analysed the sub-sections contained in section 69 and concluded that neither expressly nor by implication did they give power to the Commission to intervene in the inquest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	294	I agree that the section does not give an express power to intervene , and therefore the issue to be determined is whether the power can be derived by reasonable implication . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	295	On this point I think that the arguments are finely balanced and I recognise the force of the reasoning in the judgments of the Lord Chief Justice and the majority of the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	296	In my opinion the outcome depends upon the approach which should be adopted by a court in applying the principle recognised in Attorney-General v Great Eastern Railway : should the court apply the principle with a degree of strictness or should it adopt a liberal approach ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	297	53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	298	In my opinion the authorities show that a liberal approach should be adopted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	299	In Attorney-General v Great Eastern Railway Company Lord Selborne LC stated at p 478 : `` It appears to me to be important that the doctrine of ultrà vires , as it was explained in that case -LSB- Ashbury Raiway Carriage and Iron Co v Riche -LRB- 1875 -RRB- LR 7 HL 653 -RSB- , should be maintained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	300	But I agree with Lord Justice James that this doctrine ought to be reasonably , and not unreasonably , understood and applied , and that whatever may fairly be regarded as incidental to , or consequential upon , those things which the Legislature has authorized , ought not -LRB- unless expressly prohibited -RRB- to be held , by judicial construction , to be ultrà vires . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	301	It is also relevant to note that Lord Selborne then recognised that acts may be intra vires `` on the ground that they are such acts , on the borderline between authority and no authority , as may reasonably be thought incidental to the exercise of powers expressly given '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	302	Lord Blackburn stated at p 481 : `` 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	303	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	304	I quite agree with what Lord Justice James has said on this first point as to prohibition , that those things which are incident to , and may reasonably and properly be done under the main purpose , though they may not be literally within it , would not be prohibited . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	305	54 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	306	It is possible to discern a degree of difference between the speech of Lord Selborne in Attorney-General v Great Eastern Railway Company and the speech of Lord Macnaghten in Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants v Osborne -LSB- 1910 -RSB- AC 87 , where he said at p 97 : `` The learned counsel for the appellants did not , as I understood their argument , venture to contend that the power which they claimed could be derived by reasonable implication from the language of the Legislature . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	307	They said it was a power ` incidental , ' ` ancillary , ' or ` conducive ' to the purposes of trade unions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	308	If these rather loose expressions are meant to cover something beyond what may be found in the language which the Legislature has used , all I can say is that , so far as I know , there is no foundation in principle or authority for the proposition involved in their use . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	309	Lord Selborne no doubt did use the term ` incidental ' in a well-known passage in his judgment in Attorney-General v Great Eastern Railway Company . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	310	But Lord Watson certainly understood him to use it as equivalent to what might be derived by reasonable implication from the language of the Act to which the company owed its constitution ; and Lord Selborne himself , to judge from his language in Murray v Scott -LRB- 1884 -RRB- 9 App Case 519 , could have meant nothing more .

25	315	In Attorney-General v Smethwick Corporation -LSB- 1932 -RSB- Ch 562 Lord Hanworth MR , after referring to the authorities , stated at page 577 : `` We have , therefore , the direction of the House of Lords that if the enterprise we are considering is incidental to or consequential upon those things which the Legislature has authorized , it ought not to be held to be ultra vires .

25	320	And at p 461 McCarthy J stated : '' ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	321	in determining what powers actually are conferred by legislation , the Courts will consider the corporation as having , not only the powers expressly stated , but also `` whatever may fairly be regarded as incidental to , or consequential upon , those things which the Legislature has authorised '' : Lord Selborne in Attorney-General v Great Eastern Railway Company -LSB- 1880 -RSB- 5 App Cas 473 , 478 ; Dundee Harbour Trustees v D & J Nicol -LSB- 1915 -RSB- AC 550 , 570 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	322	Further , in deciding what can fairly be regarded as incidental to express powers , the Courts do not think narrowly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	323	They bear in mind the public nature of the obligations of a local body and the requirements of its community , and they take a liberal view of the power under consideration : Attorney-General v Crayford Urban District Council -LSB- 1962 -RSB- Ch 575 ; -LSB- 1962 -RSB- 2 All ER 247 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	324	Finally if the act done is within a discretionary power of the corporation , the Courts will not interfere if the discretion has been exercised reasonably and bona fide : Westminster Corporation v London and North Western Railway -LSB- 1905 -RSB- AC 426 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	325	It is important to bear these directions in mind , for the conclusion one reaches in this case depends largely , it seems to me , on the spirit in which one approaches the interpretation of the statutory provisions on which the respondent relies ... . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	326	57 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	327	Wade and Forsyth on Administrative Law 8th Ed at page 219 also state that the courts adopt a liberal approach : `` A statutory power will be construed as impliedly authorising everything which can fairly be regarded as incidental or consequential to the power itself ; and this doctrine is not applied narrowly . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	328	Then after referring to a number of authorities the authors say at page 220 : `` Statutory powers therefore have considerable latitude , and by reasonable construction the courts can soften the rigour of the ultra vires principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	329	Although this book contains so many instances of that principle being infringed , it must be remembered that the courts intervene only where the thing done goes beyond what can fairly be treated as incidental or consequential . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	330	58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	331	In my opinion the liberal approach stated in the authorities is applicable to the determination of the powers of the Commission as well as to the determination of the powers of local authorities and commercial companies , notwithstanding that the Commission was established pursuant to the Belfast Agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	332	A body such as the Commission , like any corporation created by statute , is bound to have incidental functions to perform and I do not consider that it is appropriate to hold that it has no powers other than those expressly conferred on it by statute : as Lord Selborne stated in Attorney-General v Great Eastern Railway Company at p 478 , if a corporation is not to have a power reasonably incidental to its express powers , the exercise of that power should be expressly prohibited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
25	333	59 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
25	334	When I turn to consider whether the power to intervene in an inquest can be implied as fairly incidental to what is expressly authorised by section 69 and when , in accordance with the authorities to which I have referred , that question is approached in a liberal and not in a narrow way , I am of opinion that the power is fairly incidental to the express powers given by the section . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
25	335	Section 69 -LRB- 5 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- empowers the Commission to give assistance to an individual who applies to it and who has commenced or wishes to commence proceedings involving law or practice relating to the protection of human rights , and section 69 -LRB- 5 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- empowers the Commission itself to bring such proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
25	336	On a strict construction it can be argued that as Parliament in section 69 -LRB- 5 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- has only authorised the Commission to give assistance to a person who himself is bringing proceedings , Parliament did not intend that the Commission should itself intervene in proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
25	337	Similarly it can be argued that as Parliament in section 69 -LRB- 5 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- empowered the Commission itself to bring proceedings , Parliament did not intend that the Commission should intervene in proceedings which it had not commenced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
25	338	But I consider that a more liberal interpretation leads to the conclusion that where Parliament has expressly authorised the Commission to assist an individual to bring proceedings in respect of human rights and to bring proceedings itself , it is incidental to those powers for the Commission also to have the power to intervene in proceedings where a human rights issue arises and where the court permits it to intervene . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
25	339	60 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
25	340	I consider that this conclusion is supported by the provisions of section 69 -LRB- 6 -RRB- which state that the Commission shall promote understanding and awareness of the importance of human rights in Northern Ireland . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
25	341	Again it can be argued that the power relates to educating the public and public bodies as to the importance of human rights , particularly by research and educational activities , and that the power does not extend to making submissions to a court on a point of human rights law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
25	342	But on a more liberal approach , and bearing in mind that on occasions this House has permitted an interested body to intervene in proceedings to make submissions , as where Amnesty International was permitted to make submissions in R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate , Ex parte Pinochet Ugarte -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 1 AC 61 , I am of opinion that the making of legal submissions to a court can be regarded as incidental to the power of promoting understanding of human rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
25	343	I do not express any opinion on the ambit of section 71 -LRB- 1 -RRB- save to say that I do not consider that it operates to prevent the Commission intervening to make submissions in an inquest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
25	344	61 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
25	345	Therefore I would allow the appeal and would hold that the Commission had power to intervene in the proceedings of the inquest to make submissions on a human rights issue . 	lord hutton	self	outcome	0.8	NAN
25	346	However I wish to emphasise that the only issue before the House is whether such an intervention is within the powers of the Commission , and I also desire to express my full agreement with the observations of my noble and learned friend Lord Slynn of Hadley in paragraph 25 of his speech that it is for the court to decide whether it will permit the Commission to intervene and that the Commission should exercise caution in deciding whether to apply to intervene in proceedings . 	lord hutton	lord slynn	NAN	0.8	NAN

25	351	This appeal from the Court of Appeal of Northern Ireland raises a question of the construction of s. 69 in Part VII of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
25	352	Sections 68 and 72 create a new statutory body to be known as the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission -LRB- the ` Commission ' -RRB- and s. 69 states what are the functions of that body . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
25	353	The question is whether the statutory functions include intervening in legal proceedings , specifically applying to intervene in inquests when a point has arisen in an inquest to which the European Convention on Human Rights -LRB- the ` Convention ' -RRB- as incorporated into the law of Northern Ireland is or may be relevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
25	354	It is the opinion of Carswell LCJ and , in the Court of Appeal , of McCollum LJ and Sir John MacDermott that the statutory functions of the Commission do not include such intervention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

25	357	The primary guide to construction is to be found in the preamble of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
25	358	It states that it is : '' An Act to make new provision for the government of Northern Ireland for the purpose of implementing the agreement reached at multi-party talks on Northern Ireland set out in Command Paper 3883 '' The agreement referred to is the multi party agreement generally known as the ` Belfast Agreement ' .

25	359	It was a unique constitutional document of both national and international significance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
25	360	It represented an agreement between the governments of the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic as to the status of Northern Ireland and included , inter alia , provision for various institutions to be set up in the respective countries . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
25	361	However , it also represented a political settlement within the respective countries themselves . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
25	362	It had been negotiated with the participation of the recognised political parties and was commended to the people of the North and the South for their approval . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
25	363	It was validated by referenda held in each country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
25	364	By the Belfast Agreement the parties , in a section headed `` Rights , Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity '' , affirmed their commitment to human rights and the British Government undertook to complete the incorporation of the Convention into the law of Northern Ireland giving direct access to the courts and giving the courts the power to overrule legislation of the Northern Ireland Assembly on grounds of inconsistency -LRB- paragraph 2 -RRB- , providing for equal opportunities -LRB- paragraph 3 -RRB- and the setting-up of a new Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission to consult and advise upon supplementing Convention rights in Westminster legislation -LRB- paragraph 4 -RRB- .

25	378	The Commission put at the forefront of its case the well known statement of Lord Selborne LC in the case of Att-Gen v Great Eastern Rly Co -LRB- 1880 -RRB- 5 App Cas 473 at 478 which concerned an Act of Parliament for the construction and operation of railways by railway companies , referring to what had been said in an earlier case , Ashbury Rly Carriage and Iron Co v Riche LR 7 HL 653 , concerning the powers of an industrial company under its memorandum : `` It appears to me to be important that the doctrine of ultra vires , as it was explained in that case , should be maintained .

25	379	But I agree with James LJ that this doctrine ought to be reasonably , and not unreasonably , understood and applied , and that whatever may fairly be regarded as incidental to , or consequential upon , those things which the legislature has authorised , ought not -LRB- unless expressly prohibited -RRB- to be held , by judicial construction , to be ultra vires .

25	397	A primary function of the Commission is stated in s. 69 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- to be to review and make recommendations before two years have elapsed for improving its effectiveness and the adequacy and effectiveness of the functions conferred on it in Part VII of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	398	It is thus contemplated that the functions may have been drawn more narrowly than the Commission thinks is appropriate and it requires the Commission to address that problem by making recommendations to the Secretary of State . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	399	This recognises that enhancements of the Commission 's powers beyond those expressly granted will raise political considerations to be assessed by the Executive not the Judiciary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	400	In declining to be drawn into the extension of the powers of the Commission , I consider that the Lord Chief Justice and the majority of the Court of Appeal correctly understood the intent of the Belfast Agreement and the implementing legislation and their place in the constitutional framework of the Province . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	401	69 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	402	The argument of the Commission as presented to your Lordships -LRB- supported by the Secretary of State as an intervener -RRB- was put in three ways . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	403	The first was to submit that there was an over-arching purpose to be found in s. 69 which was to give the Commission whatever powers were appropriate for a Human Rights Commission and the various subsections were merely examples of such powers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	404	But this is not how section 69 is drafted nor , for that matter , is paragraph 5 drafted in that way either . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	405	They are lists of specific functions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	406	The nearest that s. 69 comes to a general purpose is in subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	407	But this provision for keeping under review the adequacy and effectiveness of the law and practice of Northern Ireland is preliminary to the exercise of its functions under -LRB- 2 -RRB- , -LRB- 3 -RRB- , -LRB- 7 -RRB- and -LRB- 9 -RRB- and can not be said to justify claiming a power to intervene in judicial proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	408	This was the second way in which the Commission put its argument , relying on the words `` keep under review '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	409	But this argument fails because , as I have said , these words do not imply a power to intervene in judicial proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	410	70 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	411	The third way of putting its argument was that upon which the Commission mainly relied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	412	This was that the duty to `` promote understanding and awareness of the importance of human rights '' : subsection -LRB- 6 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	413	The corresponding words in the Belfast Agreement are `` providing information and promoting awareness of human rights '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	414	If this was intended to imply a power to intervene in judicial proceedings it is an odd way to do it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	415	The obvious import is public education and this is exemplified by the two examples given - `` research '' and `` educational activities '' : this is how it expressly visualises that the purpose described will be carried out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	416	The context of subsection -LRB- 6 -RRB- is further demonstrated by its juxtaposition with the preceding subsection , subsection -LRB- 5 -RRB- -LRB- cross-linking with sections 70 and 71 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	417	As counsel specifically accepted , subsection -LRB- 5 -RRB- is drawn in specifically limited terms which preclude construing subsection -LRB- 5 -RRB- as authorising the claimed power to intervene . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	418	When a section includes a specific subsection dealing with and limiting the Commission 's power to involve itself in litigation , it is not consonant with the ordinary canons of statutory construction to construe another subsection which does not expressly do so as removing the limitations in the specific provision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	419	But in any event , where incidental powers are concerned , they should only be implied where they are reasonably implicit in the performance of the primary express function . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	420	Engaging in litigation can not be said to be implicit in or necessary for the subsection -LRB- 6 -RRB- function of promoting understanding and awareness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	421	Subsection -LRB- 6 -RRB- already contains its own addition of incidental powers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
25	422	Where the draftsman of the Act has wished to include incidental powers he has done so expressly , as he has done in subsections -LRB- 8 -RRB- and -LRB- 9 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
25	423	71 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
25	424	Therefore I would not construe s. 69 , even divorced from its context , as conferring the power claimed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
25	425	When one adds the legislative context of the Act as being legislation to give effect to the Belfast Agreement , I consider that the correctness of the answer given by the courts in Northern Ireland is clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
25	426	If the Commission desires powers greater than those expressly given by s. 69 it should recommend to the Secretary of State that it be given them and the Secretary of State can make the necessary political decision and take steps to implement it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
25	427	It would appear that the Secretary of State already believes that the Commission should have the claimed power ; if so it is for him to initiate the appropriate legislative steps . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
25	428	72 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
25	429	There was a subsidiary point which I should mention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
25	430	It was suggested that the Commission should have the power claimed so that it could act as an amicus curiae . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
25	431	This argument was misconceived for a number of reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
25	432	First , there already exist powers to appoint amici and they are constitutionally to be exercised by the Attorney-General . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
25	433	Secondly , the Commission does not see its role as being impartially to assist the court which is the role of an amicus . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
25	434	The Commission has avowedly the object of arguing strenuously for its view of human rights and their protection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
25	435	This is no criticism of the Commission but it is not the role of an amicus . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
25	436	In some circumstances a court can request an advocate to assist it by representing an unrepresented party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
25	437	But that is not the present case and the provision of assistance to unrepresented or inadequately represented parties or acting for victims of human rights infringements is already expressly dealt with in s. 69 -LRB- 5 -RRB- , s. 70 and s. 71 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
25	438	-LRB- It should be noted , pace what my noble and learned friend Lord Slynn has said in paragraph 23 of his Opinion , that in sections 70 and 71 the `` person '' referred to is not the Commission but the person whom the Commission is assisting or acting for . -RRB- 	lord hobhouse	lord slynn	partagr	1	NAN
25	439	So this submission by the Commission did not assist its case on the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
25	440	Similarly , reference to the fact that your Lordships are , as the supreme court of this country , willing on occasions exceptionally to entertain written or oral submissions from persons or entities not parties to the relevant appeal again does not assist because what is in question in the present case is not the powers of the court but the powers of the Commission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
25	441	As regards the powers of the Court and their exercise , I would join my noble and learned friends in what they have said in that connection in paragraphs 25 and 61 . 	lord hobhouse	all	partagr	1	NAN
25	442	73 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
25	443	Accordingly I would dismiss this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
