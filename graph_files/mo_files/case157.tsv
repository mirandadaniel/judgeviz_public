157	1	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
157	2	LORD NICHOLLS OF BIRKENHEAD 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
157	3	This appeal raises a question on the effect of the Landlord and Tenant -LRB- Covenants -RRB- Act 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
157	4	A sublease invariably contains a covenant by the lessor to pay the rent due under the head lease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
157	5	Before the enactment of the 1995 Act a lessor could , by the use of appropriate wording , limit his liability under such a covenant in whatever way he and the subtenant might agree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
157	6	In particular , the lessor 's liability could be restricted to the period while the reversion to the sublease remained vested in him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
157	7	This was legally possible , if seldom met in practice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
157	8	When the lessor 's liability was confined in this way , and the lessor assigned the reversion , his successor would be liable under this covenant by virtue of privity of estate but the lessor 's own liability by virtue of privity of contract would be at an end . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
157	9	The issue on this appeal is whether the 1995 Act precludes a lessor from now limiting his liability in this way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
157	10	The Court of Appeal held it does : -LSB- 2005 -RSB- 1 WLR 236 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
157	11	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
157	12	The context is as follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
157	13	In February 2002 Avonridge Property Co Ltd acquired by assignment a lease of seven small shop units at Wealdstone , Middlesex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	14	The lease was for a term of 99 years expiring in 2067 , at an annual rent of # 16,700 subject to review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	15	Avonridge granted subleases of six of these shops for substantially the same term as its own lease , or head lease as the lease then became . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	16	The rent payable under each sublease was a peppercorn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	17	The sublessees paid Avonridge substantial premiums for their subleases , of the order of # 75,000 for each sublease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	18	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	19	Each sublease contained , in clause 6 , a landlord 's covenant for quiet enjoyment and for payment of the rent reserved by the head lease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	20	The words of covenant read as follows -LRB- commas have been added to assist reading -RRB- : ` The Landlord covenants with the Tenant as follows -LRB- but not , in the case of Avonridge Property Company Limited only , so as to be liable after the Landlord has disposed of its interest in the Property -RRB- ... . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	21	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	22	On 2 April 2002 Avonridge assigned the head lease to a Mr Dhirajlal Phithwa . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	23	Mr Phithwa was , to use the old legal phrase , a man of straw . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	24	He disappeared , leaving unpaid the rent due under the head lease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	25	The head lessor , the London Diocesan Fund and the Parochial Church Council of Holy Trinity , Wealdstone , commenced forfeiture proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	26	The subtenants were granted relief , on unexceptional terms : they had to pay the rent arrears under the head lease with interest and costs , and take new leases of their individual units . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	27	The new leases were for the same term as their former subleases and at a rent equal to an apportioned part of the rental payable under the forfeited head lease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	28	This meant that for the future , under the new leases , the former subtenants had to pay an annual rent of # 2,376 or , in one instance , # 2,441 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	29	This is to be contrasted with the nominal rent payable under the subleases they had bought from Avonridge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	30	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	31	The subtenants brought proceedings against Avonridge , claiming damages for breach of the landlord 's covenant in clause 6 of their leases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	32	Judge Copley sitting in Willesden County Court gave judgment for the subtenants , for damages to be assessed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	33	He held that the 1995 Act rendered void the words in clause 6 limiting Avonridge 's liability to the time it was the landlord . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	34	The Court of Appeal , comprising Pill , Jonathan Parker and Hooper LJJ , dismissed Avonridge 's appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	35	Avonridge has now appealed to your Lordships ' House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	36	A trap for the unwary ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	37	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
157	38	It must be said at once that Avonridge 's case is not overburdened with merit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	39	Indeed , on their face the transactions have the appearance of a scam . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	40	The sublessees ' security , and the value of their subleases , depended on the strength of the sublessor 's covenant to pay the head lease rental . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	41	But Avonridge could end its liability to pay this rent at any time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	42	There was , it seems , no restriction on assignment of the head lease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	43	If Avonridge assigned the head lease its liability as tenant of that lease would end automatically , by virtue of section 5 of the 1995 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	44	Its liability as landlord under the subleases would also end automatically , by virtue of the limited terms of the landlord 's covenant in clause 6 of the subleases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	45	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	46	An assignee of the head lease from Avonridge would of course become liable to the head lessor in respect of the tenant 's covenants in the head lease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	47	An assignee would also become liable to the sublessees in respect of the landlord 's covenant in clause 6 of the subleases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	48	In each instance this liability would arise by virtue of privity of estate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	49	But no one of financial substance would take an assignment of the head lease and thereby incur liability to pay rent of # 16,700 per annum to the head lessor , save on payment of a substantial ` reverse ' premium . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	50	No one would do so , because the property for which this rent was payable was let on correspondingly long subleases yielding no rental income . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	51	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	52	Thus the overall position was that Avonridge received premiums from the subtenants totalling altogether # 458,500 in exchange for subleases which from their inception were essentially valueless . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	53	They were valueless because by its own act of assignment to a worthless assignee Avonridge could at any time put the subleases in jeopardy of forfeiture . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	54	Avonridge could do this without incurring any liability either to the head lessor or to the subtenants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	55	From the outset it was in Avonridge 's financial interest to take this course as soon as possible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	56	Avonridge lost no time in doing so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	57	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	58	How these unfortunate sublessees came to acquire and pay for these subleases is not a matter before your Lordships . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	59	Nor is the question whether any of the circumstances surrounding these transactions may afford the sublessees redress , whether against Avonridge or others . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	60	Your Lordships ' House is concerned only with the rights and obligations of the parties under the terms of the subleases they entered into . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	61	But the potential use of the provisions of the 1995 Act in the manner illustrated by the facts of this case is a matter to be taken into account when interpreting the statutory provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	62	The 1995 Act 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
157	63	The 1995 Act gave effect , with amendments , to the recommendations of the Law Commission in its report ` Landlord and Tenant Law - Privity of Contract and Estate ' : Law Com No 174 -LRB- 1988 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	64	One of the principal mischiefs the Act was intended to remedy was that , as the law stood , the original tenant of a lease remained liable for performance of the tenant 's covenants throughout the entire duration of the lease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	65	A tenant might part with his lease and many years later find himself liable for substantial amounts of unpaid rent , perhaps much increased under rent review provisions , and for the cost of making good extensive dilapidations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	66	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	67	This was considered unfair . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	68	This potential liability was not widely understood by tenants , and it could lead to hardship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	69	Section 5 of the Act remedied this defect in the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	70	Section 5 provides that where a tenant assigns the whole of the premises demised to him under a tenancy , he is released from the tenant covenants of the tenancy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	71	A tenant covenant is a covenant falling to be complied with by the tenant of premises demised by the tenancy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	72	Tenancy includes a sub-tenancy : section 28 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	73	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	74	Section 6 contains a corresponding provision for the benefit of landlords in respect of landlord covenants , but this provision is not so far-reaching in its effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	75	Unlike the automatic release of tenant covenants brought about by assignment of the whole of the demised premises , assignment of the reversion in the whole of the demised premises does not automatically relieve the landlord from his liability under the landlord covenants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	76	The Law Commission considered the new provision regarding landlord covenants could not mirror precisely the position regarding tenant covenants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	77	Tenants rarely , if ever , have a right to give or withhold consent to dispositions by their landlord . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	78	Moreover , there was less need for radical change with landlord covenants because landlords undertake far fewer obligations than tenants , and landlords may not be troubled by the prospect of continuing responsibility : see para 4.16 of its report . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	79	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	80	So sections 6 to 8 of the Act provide a landlord with a means which may result in his being released from the landlord covenants but will not necessarily do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	81	If the landlord assigns the whole of the premises of which he is landlord he may apply to be released from the landlord covenants of the tenancy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	82	A landlord covenant is a covenant falling to be complied with by the landlord of the premises demised by a tenancy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	83	An application for release is made by the landlord serving an appropriate notice on the tenant requesting a release of the landlord covenant wholly or in part . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	84	Where the landlord makes such an application the covenant is released to the requested extent if the tenant consents , or if he fails to object , or if he does object but the court decides it is reasonable for the covenant to be released : section 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	85	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	86	These statutory provisions might readily be stultified if the parties to a lease could exclude their operation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	87	In particular , the provision for automatic release of tenant covenants on assignment of a lease would be a weak instrument if it were open to a landlord to provide that the original tenant 's contractual liability should continue for the whole term notwithstanding section 5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
157	88	So the Act , in section 25 , enacts a comprehensive anti-avoidance provision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	89	Subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- relevantly provides : ` Any agreement relating to a tenancy is void to the extent that - -LRB- a -RRB- it would apart from this section have effect to exclude , modify or otherwise frustrate the operation of any provision of this Act , or -LRB- b -RRB- it provides for - -LRB- i -RRB- the termination or surrender of the tenancy , or -LRB- ii -RRB- the imposition on the tenant of any penalty , disability , or liability , in the event of the operation of any provision of this Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	90	. ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	91	The words in parenthesis in Avonridge 's covenant in clause 6 of each sublease are an ` agreement relating to a tenancy ' within the meaning of this section : section 25 -LRB- 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	92	But does this agreement ` frustrate the operation ' of any provision of the Act ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	93	That is the key question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	94	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	95	The subtenants submit it does . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	96	The limited release provisions in sections 6 to 8 were intended to be the sole means whereby an original landlord could obtain a release from the landlord covenants when he assigned the reversion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	97	The parenthetical words in clause 6 would frustrate that statutory purpose if they were allowed to have effect according to their tenor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	98	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	99	I am unable to agree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	100	Where I part company with this submission is its statement of the statutory purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	101	Sections 5 to 8 are relieving provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	102	They are intended to benefit tenants , or landlords , as the case may be . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	103	That is their purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	104	That is how they are meant to operate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	105	These sections introduced a means , which can not be ousted , whereby in certain circumstances , without the agreement of the other party , a tenant or landlord can be released from a liability he has assumed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	106	The object of the legislation was that on lawful assignment of a tenancy or reversion , and irrespective of the terms of the tenancy , the tenant or the landlord should have an exit route from his future liabilities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	107	This route should be available in accordance with the statutory provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	108	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	109	Thus the mischief at which the statute was aimed was the absence in practice of any such exit route . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	110	Consistently with this the legislation was not intended to close any other exit route already open to the parties : in particular , that by agreement their liability could be curtailed from the outset or later released or waived . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	111	The possibility that by agreement the parties may limit their liability in this way was not , it seems , perceived as having unfair consequences in practice , even though landlords normally have greater bargaining power than tenants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	112	So there was no call for legislation to exclude the parties ' capacity to make such an agreement , ending their liability in circumstances other than those provided in the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
157	113	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	114	Section 25 is of course to be interpreted generously , so as to ensure the operation of the Act is not frustrated , either directly or indirectly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	115	But there is nothing in the language or scheme of the Act to suggest the statute was intended to exclude the parties ' ability to limit liability under their covenants from the outset in whatever way they may agree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	116	An agreed limitation of this nature does not impinge upon the operation of the statutory provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	117	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	118	This is so whether the agreed limitation is included in the lease itself or is in a separate document by way of waiver or agreement to release . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	119	The legal effect is the same in each case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	120	Whatever its form , an agreed limitation of liability does not impinge upon the operation of the statutory provisions because , as already noted , the statutory provisions are intended to operate to relieve tenants and landlords from a liability which would otherwise exist . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	121	They are not intended to impose a liability which otherwise would be absent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	122	They are not intended to enlarge the liability either of a tenant or landlord . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	123	The Act does not compel a landlord to enter into a covenant with his tenant to pay the rent under a head lease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	124	The Act does not compel this , even though it may be eminently reasonable that a landlord should do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	125	Nor do the statutory restrictions on the circumstances where a landlord can end his liability without his tenant 's consent carry any implication that a tenant may not agree to end his landlord 's liability in other circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	126	Such an implication would be inconsistent with the underlying scheme of these provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	127	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	128	This appraisal accords with the thrust of the Law Commission 's report . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	129	The commission expressly recognised , in paragraph 2.17 , that the parties to a lease were able to limit their obligations so that their obligations ended on disposal of their interests : ' A lease can , as a matter of bargain , limit the obligations of one or both of the parties , so that they come to an end if the parties transfer their interest in the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	130	However , this is rarely done . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	131	A similar view is expressed in paragraph 3.3 : the continuing liability of the original parties to leases is a ` matter of contract ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	132	The parties ` are free to vary the normal rule ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	133	This is ` sometimes done , but not frequently ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	134	Nowhere in its report does the commission suggest the parties ' freedom to vary the normal rule has given rise to problems and should be curtailed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	135	Had such a fundamental incursion into basic law been intended that would surely have found clear expression in the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	136	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	137	Nor do the events in this case exemplify a loophole in the Act Parliament can not have intended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
157	138	The risks involved were not obscure or concealed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	139	They were evident on the face of the subleases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	140	The sublessees were to pay up-front a capitalised rent for the whole term of the subleases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	141	But clause 6 enabled Avonridge to shake off all its landlord obligations at will . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	142	Any competent conveyancer would , or should , have warned the sublessees of the risks , clearly and forcefully . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	143	The Chesterfield case and section 3 22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	144	Attention was drawn to the decisions of Lightman J and the Court of Appeal , comprising Judge and Jonathan Parker LJJ and Bodey J , in BHP Petroleum Great Britain Ltd v Chesterfield Properties Ltd -LSB- 2002 -RSB- Ch 12 and -LSB- 2002 -RSB- Ch 194 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	145	By an agreement for a lease the landlord agreed to carry out certain building works . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	146	The landlord 's obligations were expressed to be personal obligations of the landlord , Chesterfield Properties Ltd. . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	147	In the agreement the tenant acknowledged it would have no claim against Chesterfield 's successors arising out of the landlord 's obligations to remedy building works defects . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	148	Some time after the lease was granted Chesterfield assigned the reversion to an associated company . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	149	Chesterfield served a section 8 notice on the tenant , applying to be released from all ` the landlord 's obligations under the tenancy ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	150	The tenant did not serve a counter-notice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	151	In answer to a claim brought by the tenant against Chesterfield in respect of building works defects Chesterfield asserted it had been released from its obligations by section 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	152	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	153	Both courts rightly held that service of the section 8 notice did not release Chesterfield from its obligation to make good defects . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	154	That was a personal obligation and , as such , not a landlord covenant within the meaning of section 28 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1995 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	155	It was not an obligation falling to be complied with by the person for the time being entitled to the reversion : -LSB- 2002 -RSB- Ch 194 , 211-212 , para 59 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	156	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	157	This decision does not assist the sublessees in the present appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	158	Unlike Chesterfield 's liability under the lease agreement , Avonridge 's liability under clause 6 was expressly limited to the period for which it held the reversion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	159	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	160	Reference was also made to section 3 of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	161	I must explain as briefly as possible why this section is irrelevant in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
157	162	One purpose of the 1995 Act was to abolish the long-established distinction between covenants which ` touch and concern the land ' or , in its more modern formulation , covenants having ` reference to the subject-matter of the lease ' , and those which do not .

157	163	The former expression derives from Spencer 's case -LRB- 1583 -RRB- 5 Co Rep 16a and the latter from sections 141 and 142 of the Law of Property Act 1925 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
157	164	Generations of conveyancers and law students have been familiar with these phrases and with writers ' lists of covenants held by courts to be on one or other side of the line : see , for instance , Megarry and Wade ` The Law of Real Property ' , 6th edition -LRB- 2000 -RRB- , pages 955-956 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
157	165	The significance of the distinction was that only covenants satisfying this ancient test ` ran ' with the land so that the benefit or burden passed to assignees by virtue of privity of estate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
157	166	The distinction has long been criticised as illogical and not easily drawn in practice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
157	167	Section 3 of the 1995 Act , read with section 30 -LRB- 4 -RRB- , abolished this distinction for post-1995 tenancies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
157	168	In place the Act established a new , self-contained statutory code regulating the transmission of the benefit and burden of landlord and tenant covenants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
157	169	Under section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- the benefit and burden of all landlord and tenant covenants of a tenancy is annexed to the premises demised by the tenancy and the reversion in them and passes on an assignment of those premises or the reversion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
157	170	The parties to a lease , however , still remain free to agree that the benefit or burden of a covenant shall not pass on assignment of the tenancy or reversion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
157	171	Where a covenant is expressed to be ` personal to any person ' section 3 does not make the covenant enforceable by or , as the case may be , against any other person : section 3 -LRB- 6 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
157	172	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
157	173	The covenant in clause 6 does not fall within this ` personal ' category . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
157	174	It was intended to endure throughout the term of the sublease and be binding on Avonridge 's assigns . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
157	175	So section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- applied to this covenant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
157	176	But that leads nowhere in the present case , because in clause 6 Avonridge 's liability under this covenant is expressly limited to the period while it holds the reversion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
157	177	Nothing in section 3 precludes the parties from limiting the liability of the original covenantor in this way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
157	178	Nor is such a limitation rendered void by section 25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
157	179	This limitation on the duration of the original covenantor 's liability does not affect the transmission of the benefit and burden of the covenant in accordance with section 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
157	180	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls

157	196	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
157	197	I have the misfortune to differ from my noble and learned friends as to the disposal of this appeal . 	lord walker	all	fulldisa	0.8	lord nicholls
157	198	I shall express my dissent as briefly as possible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
157	199	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
157	200	Mr Mark Warwick -LRB- for the appellant ex-landlord -RRB- did not seek to argue that its conduct had been meritorious . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
157	201	In a period of less than two months it acquired the head lease of seven shop units , granted six under-leases at premiums which gave it a profit of the order of # 200,000 , and then sold the head lease -LRB- for # 50,000 -RRB- to Mr Phithwa . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
157	202	Mr Phithwa himself made a profit of over # 20,000 -LRB- by granting a seventh under-lease at a premium -RRB- and then disappeared without ever paying any rent under the head lease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
157	203	The unfortunate subtenants have had to pay a heavy price to avoid forfeiture -LRB- unless and except so far as they may have been able to pass on that burden to their solicitors -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
157	204	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
157	205	My noble and learned friends rightly attach great importance to the general legislative purpose of the Landlord & Tenant -LRB- Covenants -RRB- Act 1995 -LRB- `` the Act '' -RRB- . 	lord walker	all	partagr	0.8	lord nicholls
157	206	It was to provide for the release from liability of ex-landlords and ex-tenants , not for the imposition of such liability on them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
157	207	But section 25 of the Act contains a provision against `` contracting-out '' expressed in wide terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
157	208	It applies -LRB- by section 25 -LRB- 4 -RRB- -RRB- to an agreement relating to a tenancy whether or not the agreement is contained in the instrument creating the tenancy , or ante-dates it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
157	209	It seems to me clear that if each of the six subleases had contained a covenant by the tenant to release the landlord from liability after it -LRB- the landlord -RRB- had disposed of its interest in the demised premises , even though the landlord had not complied with the procedure set out in section 8 of the Act , that covenant would have been struck down by section 25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
157	210	The landlord would have been using his bargaining power `` to exclude , modify or otherwise frustrate '' the operation of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
157	211	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
157	212	I can not see why a different result should follow just because the contracting-out provision is contained , not in a separate covenant , but in a rather clumsy parenthesis at the beginning of clause 6 , which -LRB- as is common ground -RRB- contains `` landlord covenants '' within the meaning of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
157	213	I can not reconcile this with Mr Warwick 's repeated submission that his case depended on principle , and not on some narrow semantic point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
157	214	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
157	215	I am driven to the conclusion that although the general legislative purpose of the Act was to effect the release from liability of landlords and tenants on their assignment of their interests , subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the Act , section 25 is expressed in terms wide enough to interfere with the freedom of contract which was available to the parties in negotiating a tenancy before the coming into force of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
157	216	By restricting the parties ' freedom of contract , the Act -LRB- in a case such as the present -RRB- does operate to make it more difficult for a landlord to escape liability on landlord covenants -LRB- within the meaning of the Act -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
157	217	I would accept the submission of Mr Wells , for the respondents , that that can be done only by the procedure laid down in section 8 of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
157	218	To that limited extent the Act does operate , as it seems to me , to shut off what my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead has described as `` any other exit route '' previously open to the parties . 	lord walker	lord nicholls	partagr	0.9	lord nicholls
157	219	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
157	220	The Law Commission considered this topic very carefully , but there is no indication either in the 1986 working paper -LRB- no. 99 -RRB- or in the 1986 Report on Privity of Contract and Estate -LRB- Law Com No 174 -RRB- that the Law Commission addressed this particular point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
157	221	In my opinion it has to be answered by construing the language of the Act itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
157	222	For my part I would have dismissed this appeal . 	lord walker	self	outcome	0.9	lord nicholls
157	223	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
157	224	BARONESS HALE OF RICHMOND 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
157	225	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
157	226	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
157	227	I entirely agree with the reasons given by my noble and learned friend , Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead , for allowing this appeal . 	lady hale	lord nicholls	fullagr	0.9	lord nicholls
157	228	I add only a few words because much was made , in the arguments before us and in the courts below , of the recommendations of the Law Commission in their Report on Privity of Contract and Estate -LRB- Law Com No 174 , 1988 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
157	229	As the parties both know , I was a member of the Law Commission , not only at the time of that Report but also when the preceding Working Paper , Privity of Contract and Estate , Duration of Liability of Parties to Leases -LRB- PWP No 95 , 1986 -RRB- was published , and thus was party to the Commission 's deliberations and recommendations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
157	230	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
157	231	Both parties to this case sought to draw support from the Law Commission 's work . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
157	232	However , it should be borne in mind when reading the Commission 's publications that the Commission contemplated that their recommendations would apply to existing as well as to new leases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
157	233	Thus the Report recommended -LRB- Law Com No 174 , at para 4.59 -RRB- : `` The introduction of our proposed scheme would not have any immediate effect on the rights and liabilities of those who were then landlords and tenants , nor those of people who were previously in that position but no longer had any interest in the property in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
157	234	Only when the interest of the current landlord or the current tenant changes hands should the proposed rules change the position . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
157	235	Hence there was no equivalent in the draft Bill annexed to the Law Commission 's Report to section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Landlord and Tenant -LRB- Covenants -RRB- Act 1995 , which limits sections 3 to 16 of the Act to new tenancies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
157	236	The limitation of the Commission 's scheme to new tenancies was the result of negotiations with the property industry after the Commission 's report . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
157	237	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
157	238	Given that the Commission contemplated that both existing and new tenancies should be covered by their recommendations , they clearly could not have contemplated any change in the existing freedom of the original parties to contract out of any continuing liability once they had parted with their interest in the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
157	239	This is confirmed by the reference to that freedom in both the Working Paper -LRB- PWP No 95 , at para 3.3 -RRB- and in the Report -LRB- Law Com No 174 , also at para 3.3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
157	240	The mischief at which the Commission 's recommendations were aimed was the continuation of a liability long after the parties had parted with their interests in the property to which it related . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
157	241	If there was already no continuing liability , because of the express terms of the lease which were apparent to all , there was no mischief . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
157	242	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
157	243	It would , of course , have been open to Parliament , when passing the 1995 Act , to limit the initial landlord 's freedom to contract out of any continuing liability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
157	244	But there is nothing in the 1995 Act which effects such a fundamental change of principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
157	245	Given the concerns of the property industry which led to the modifications of the Law Commission 's recommendations , it would have been surprising if there were . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
157	246	The provisions with which we are concerned , principally sections 6 and 8 of the 1995 Act , are closely modelled on those in clauses 4 and 6 of the Bill annexed to the Law Commission 's Report -LRB- allowing for the stylistic changes which often seem to take place when a new draftsman takes over another 's draft -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
157	247	I can not find in them , or in section 3 , which is concerned to identify those covenants which fall within the doctrine of privity of estate and are thus capable of running with the tenancy and the reversion , anything to suggest such a radical change in policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
157	248	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
157	249	For those reasons , in addition to those given by Lord Nicholls , I too would allow this appeal . 	lady hale	lord nicholls	fullagr	1	lord nicholls
