254	4	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	5	The principal question raised by these appeals is whether discriminatory acts done by an employer after termination of an employee 's contract of employment are outside the scope of the anti-discrimination legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	6	The first appeal raises this question in the context of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 , the second appeal in the context of the Race Relations Act 1976 , and the third appeal in the context of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	7	In each case the issue has been decided as a preliminary point , without a full investigation of the facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	8	The facts relevant for the purpose of this preliminary point , as found or agreed for this purpose , can be summarised as follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	9	The sex discrimination case : Ms Rhys-Harper 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	10	The discriminatory act alleged in the sex discrimination case is a little unusual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	11	It relates to an employer 's failure properly to investigate a sexual harassment complaint first made after the termination of the contract of employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	12	Christine Rhys-Harper was employed by Relaxion Group Plc , now known as Leisure Connection Plc , as a lifeguard and general assistant at the Helston sports centre . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	13	In October 1998 she was summarily dismissed on the grounds of misconduct , after a disciplinary hearing conducted by her manager , Mr Osborn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	14	She had been rude to customers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	15	Her contract of employment ended on 22 October . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	16	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	17	She then availed herself of her right to appeal against the decision to dismiss her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	18	The appeal hearing took place on 9 November . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	19	It was conducted by the general manager , Mr Adamson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	20	In the course of this hearing Ms Rhys-Harper complained that during her employment Mr Osborn had regularly subjected her to sexual harassment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	21	On 30 November she was informed that her appeal had been dismissed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	22	She was told also that the company had investigated the sexual harassment complaint , and had concluded there was insufficient evidence to establish a case against Mr Osborn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	23	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	24	On 15 February 1999 Ms Rhys-Harper made an application to an employment tribunal in respect of unfair dismissal and sex discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	25	The discrimination alleged was sexual harassment during her employment and , additionally , failure to carry out a proper investigation of her sexual harassment complaint . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	26	In April 1999 , after a preliminary hearing , the tribunal ruled that the complaint to the tribunal regarding the series of incidents of sexual harassment was made outside the prescribed period of three months . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	27	The claim should have been lodged by early January 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	28	But Relaxion 's decision , given on 30 November after investigation of Ms Rhys-Harper 's complaint , could be in itself a continuing discrimination against her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	29	She had not been seen during the investigation , nor had she been able to challenge the evidence of witnesses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	30	So time ran from 30 November , and her sex discrimination application was in time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	31	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	32	Relaxion appealed against this ruling in respect of the alleged post-termination discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	33	The Employment Appeal Tribunal , presided over by Judge Collins , allowed the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	34	The tribunal rightly regarded itself as bound by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Post Office v Adekeye -LSB- 1997 -RSB- ICR 110 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	35	Adekeye 's case was a decision in respect of the Race Relations Act , but the relevant provisions in the Sex Discrimination Act are indistinguishable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	36	The Court of Appeal , comprising Pill , Mantell and Buxton LJJ , dismissed Ms Rhys-Harper 's appeal against that decision : see -LSB- 2001 -RSB- EWCA Civ 634 , -LSB- 2001 -RSB- ICR 1176 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	37	Buxton LJ said , at para 25 , p 1185 , that Peter Gibson LJ 's conclusion in Adekeye 's case was ` entirely persuasive ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	38	Ms Rhys-Harper has now appealed to your Lordships ' House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	39	The racial discrimination case : Mr D'Souza 6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	40	The complaint in the racial discrimination case also is a little unusual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	41	The discrimination alleged is the employer 's failure to comply with a reinstatement order made by an employment tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	42	Donald D'Souza was employed by the London Borough of Lambeth as an information systems group manager until his dismissal in January 1990 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	43	The employment tribunal upheld a complaint by Mr D'Souza that he had been unfairly dismissed , discriminated against on racial grounds and victimised within the meaning of the Race Relations Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	44	The tribunal ordered the council to reinstate Mr D'Souza by 16 January 1993 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	45	On 25 March 1993 the council told Mr D'Souza it was not willing to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	46	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	47	Two years later , on 11 July 1995 , the employment tribunal held that it had not been practicable for the council to reinstate Mr D'Souza . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	48	By a decision sent to the parties on 18 October 1995 , an award of compensation was made in favour of Mr D'Souza , having regard to the council 's failure to reinstate Mr D'Souza . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	49	Meanwhile , in July 1995 Mr D'Souza had made two further applications to the employment tribunal , the subject of each being the council 's alleged racial discrimination and victimisation in deciding not to reinstate him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	50	The employment tribunal held that , following the decision in Adekeye 's case , it had no jurisdiction to hear these applications . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	51	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	52	The Employment Appeal Tribunal , under the presidency of Morison J , dismissed an appeal by Mr D'Souza . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	53	In so doing the tribunal followed Adekeye 's case , as it was obliged to do . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	54	But the tribunal did not disguise its unease , saying that ` we are of the view that the Adekeye decision fails to give effect to the intention of Parliament to provide a comprehensive legislative code ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	55	The Court of Appeal , comprising Schiemann and Robert Walker LJJ and Lloyd J , dismissed Mr D'Souza 's further appeal : see -LSB- 2001 -RSB- EWCA Civ 794 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	56	Schiemann LJ said , at paragraph 17 , that the court saw ` some force ' in the submission that the decision in Adekeye 's case could have gone the other way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	57	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	58	Mr D'Souza has now appealed against this decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	59	His appeal is supported by the Commission for Racial Equality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	60	The disability discrimination cases 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	61	The third appeal comprises four disability cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	62	Each case involves victimisation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	63	Each applicant claims he was discriminated against because he had previously made an application to an employment tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	64	In three of the four cases the alleged victimisation concerns the provision of a reference after the termination of the contract of employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN

254	66	Mr Kirker 's complaint is of this character . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	67	Nicholas Kirker was employed by British Sugar plc as a shift chemist until he was dismissed in March 1997 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	68	He has very poor eyesight and is registered as fully blind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	69	He claimed he had been discriminated against as a disabled person and unfairly dismissed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	70	Both claims succeeded in the employment tribunal and were upheld by the Employment Appeal Tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	71	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	72	In August 1997 he applied for a job as a warehouse operative , through a company called Ambitions Personnel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	73	He gave British Sugar as a referee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN

254	75	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	76	Mr Kirker then made an application to an employment tribunal against Ambitions Personnel , alleging disability discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	77	He later joined British Sugar , alleging victimisation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	78	He claimed that the reference supplied by British Sugar to Ambitions Personnel was unsatisfactory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
254	79	British Sugar successfully applied to have the claim against it struck out , on the basis of the Adekeye decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	80	The tribunal was plainly unhappy at being obliged to follow and apply this decision , observing that ' a more purposive approach ... might now find more support in today 's social and judicial climate ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	81	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	82	Next , Mrs Angel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	83	Diane Angel was employed by New Possibilities NHS Trust until July 1998 , when she was dismissed from her nursing post because she suffered from back and hip problems . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	84	She made a successful claim to an employment tribunal in respect of her dismissal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	85	In January 2000 the Trust supplied a reference for her to a prospective employer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	86	This contained material she considered to be adverse because of her earlier proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	87	In March 2000 she presented a second application to an employment tribunal , complaining of victimisation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	88	Following a preliminary hearing the tribunal ruled , in August 2000 , that it had no jurisdiction to hear the complaint . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	89	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	90	The third in this trilogy of ` reference ' cases is that of Mrs Bond . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	91	Charmaine Bond suffers from back injuries sustained in a road accident . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	92	She was employed by Hackney Citizens ' Advice Bureau until she was made redundant in October 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	93	She then made three successive applications to an employment tribunal : in November 1999 , when she claimed she had been discriminated against on account of her disability ; in January 2000 , when she alleged breach of contract and unlawful deduction of wages ; and in June 2000 , when she presented the application now under consideration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	94	In this application she claimed she had been victimised in that the bureau had refused to supply her with a reference and had given false information in reply to enquiries by two companies which had insured her property in respect of mortgage repayments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	95	The alleged acts of victimisation all related to periods after her employment with the bureau had come to an end . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	96	In October 2000 the tribunal dismissed the claim of victimisation , because she was not a person whom the bureau was employing at the relevant date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	97	The tribunal considered this outcome was ` unsatisfactory and wrong in principle ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	98	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	99	The fourth disability discrimination case is that of Mr Jones . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	100	Gerald Jones was employed by 3M Healthcare Ltd as a computer network analyst until dismissed in November 1997 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	101	He brought proceedings , which were unsuccessful , for unfair dismissal and sex and disability discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	102	While employed Mr Jones had received business cards from other organisations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	103	He had left these cards in his office when his employment ended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	104	In September 1999 he asked 3M to return the cards , but the company declined to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	105	Mr Jones then brought proceedings in the county court , and the cards were delivered to him pursuant to an order of the court made in February 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	106	Thereafter , in March 2000 , Mr Jones made an application to an employment tribunal , complaining that in respect of 3M 's earlier refusal to return the cards he had been subjected to victimisation and discrimination on the grounds of sex and disability , the disability being severe clinical depression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	107	The tribunal held it had no jurisdiction to hear the claims under the Disability Discrimination Act , because at the time he was not employed by 3M , but that it did have jurisdiction to hear the victimisation claim made under the Sex Discrimination Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	108	This conclusion , which draws a distinction between a claim for victimisation under the Sex Discrimination Act and a similar claim under the Disability Discrimination Act , derives from the impact of the Equal Treatment Directive -LRB- Council Directive No 76/207/EEC -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	109	This directive is applicable to sex discrimination but not racial or disability discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN

254	111	All four disability claimants appealed from the adverse decisions of the employment tribunals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	112	Their appeals were heard together by the Employment Appeal Tribunal under the presidency of Lindsay J . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	113	After reviewing the authorities the appeal tribunal dismissed the appeals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	114	In doing so Lindsay J commented that this outcome was unsatisfactory , adding , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- ICR 341 , 358 : ` if there is any escape other than by legislative amendment , it lies only , it seems to us , in the House of Lords ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	115	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	116	The four claimants then appealed to the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	117	The court , comprising Pill , Mummery and Latham LJJ , dismissed the appeals : see -LSB- 2002 -RSB- EWCA Civ 304 ; -LSB- 2002 -RSB- ICR 1124 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	118	Mummery LJ said , at paragraphs 12 and 21 , that the meaning of the legislation was plain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN

254	120	The statutory provisions 19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	121	The basic structure of the Sex Discrimination Act and the Race Relations Act is familiar enough . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	122	These are parallel Acts , using the same concepts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	123	Much of the language is identical . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	124	Each statute defines discrimination , and prohibits discriminatory conduct over a wide range of activities in specified fields , of which the primary one is employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	125	Sanctions are provided for breaches of the prohibitions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	126	Each Act established a commission : the Equal Opportunities Commission , in the case of the Sex Discrimination Act , and the Commission for Racial Equality , in the case of the Race Relations Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	127	The duties of the Equal Opportunities Commission were to work towards the elimination of sex discrimination , to promote equality of opportunity between men and women , and to keep under review the working of the Act and the Equal Pay Act 1970 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	128	The Commission for Racial Equality was given comparable duties regarding racial discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN

254	131	I can note first the relevant provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	132	Nothing turns , for the purpose of the present appeals , on the precise wording of the definition of sex discrimination in sections 1 and 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	133	Suffice to say , under section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- a person discriminates directly against a woman , in any circumstances relevant for the purposes of any provision of the Act , if ` on the ground of her sex he treats her less favourably than he treats or would treat a man ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	134	Under section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- discrimination also embraces ` indirect ' discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	135	Stated very broadly , this consists of applying to a woman a requirement or condition which would equally be applied to a man but which can less readily be complied with by women . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	136	Section 2 applies the section 1 definition in the converse case of less favourable treatment of a man . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	137	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	138	Section 4 provides that discrimination also includes victimisation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	139	Essentially this comprises treating a person less favourably in retaliation for her having exercised her rights under the Act or under the Equal Pay Act 1970 or having assisted others to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	140	Section 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- provides : ' A person -LRB- `` the discriminator '' -RRB- discriminates against another person -LRB- `` the person victimised '' -RRB- in any circumstances relevant for the purposes of any provision of this Act if he treats the person victimised less favourably than in those circumstances he treats or would treat other persons , and does so by reason that the person victimised has - -LRB- a -RRB- brought proceedings against the discriminator or any other person under this Act or the Equal Pay Act 1970 , or -LRB- b -RRB- given evidence or information in connection with proceedings brought by any person against the discriminator or any other person under this Act or the Equal Pay Act 1970 , or -LRB- c -RRB- otherwise done anything under or by reference to this Act or the Equal Pay Act 1970 in relation to the discriminator or any other person , or -LRB- d -RRB- alleged that the discriminator or any other person has committed an act which -LRB- whether or not the allegation so states -RRB- would amount to a contravention of this Act or give rise to a claim under the Equal Pay Act 1970 , or by reason that the discriminator knows the person victimised intends to do any of those things , or suspects the person victimised has done , or intends to do , any of them . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	141	Subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- does not apply to treatment of a person by reason of a false allegation not made in good faith . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN

254	143	Against the background of this definition of discrimination , including as it does victimisation under section 4 as well as sex discrimination under sections 1 and 2 , I turn to section 6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	144	This concerns discrimination by employers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	145	Section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- renders unlawful certain types of conduct by a prospective employer : ` It is unlawful for a person , in relation to employment by him at an establishment in Great Britain , to discriminate against a woman - -LRB- a -RRB- in the arrangements he makes for the purpose of determining who should be offered that employment , or -LRB- b -RRB- in the terms on which he offers her that employment , or -LRB- c -RRB- by refusing or deliberately omitting to offer her that employment .

254	151	` Racial grounds ' means grounds of colour , race , nationality or ethnic or national origins . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	152	The definitions of racial discrimination and victimisation in section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and section 2 of the Race Relations Act correspond to the definitions of sex discrimination and victimisation in section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and section 4 of the Sex Discrimination Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	153	Similarly , the prohibition of discrimination against applicants and employees in section 4 of the Race Relations Act corresponds in all respects now material to the like prohibition in section 6 of the Sex Discrimination Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	154	Section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- provides , with emphasis added : ` It is unlawful for a person , in the case of a person employed by him at an establishment in Great Britain , to discriminate against that employee - -LRB- a -RRB- in the terms of employment which he affords him ; or -LRB- b -RRB- in the way he affords him access to opportunities for promotion , transfer or training , or to any other benefits , facilities or services , or by refusing or deliberately omitting to afford him access to them ; or -LRB- c -RRB- by dismissing him , or subjecting him to any other detriment .

254	167	Under section 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- an employer discriminates against a disabled person if , for a reason which relates to the disabled person 's disability , he treats him less favourably than he treats others to whom that reason does not apply , and he can not show that the treatment is justified .

254	178	This directive , known colloquially as the Equal Treatment Directive , is concerned only with sex discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	179	The purpose of the directive was to put into effect in member states the principle of equal treatment for men and women in respect of several matters , including access to employment and working conditions : article 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	180	Article 5 provided that application of the principle of equal treatment with regard to working conditions , including the conditions governing dismissal , means that men and women shall be guaranteed the same conditions without discrimination on the grounds of sex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	181	Article 6 provided that member states should introduce into their national legal systems such measures as are necessary to enable all persons who consider themselves wronged by failure to apply to them the principle of equal treatment within the meaning of article 5 to pursue their claims by judicial process .

254	186	The question whether conduct of an employer after termination of the contract of employment can constitute unlawful discrimination appears to have arisen for decision for the first time in a case which came before the Employment Appeal Tribunal in 1993 : Nagarajan v Agnew -LSB- 1995 -RSB- ICR 520 .

254	189	The majority of the events listed in that subsection can occur only during employment , the whole provision is couched in the present tense , and had Parliament intended to include post-employment benefits , it would have made that intention explicit : see -LSB- 1995 -RSB- ICR 520 , 530-531 .

254	192	Omalara Adekeye was employed by the Post Office as a customer care officer until summarily dismissed for misconduct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN

254	196	The Court of Appeal , comprising Hirst , Peter Gibson and Pill LJJ , followed the decision in the Nagarajan case and held that the employment tribunal had no jurisdiction to entertain Ms Adekeye 's complaint . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	197	Section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- protects only those whose employment continues at the time of the act of discrimination : see page 118 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN

254	200	Meanwhile , the question of jurisdiction regarding post-termination conduct had arisen in the context of a victimisation claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	201	Belinda Coote presented a complaint against her former employer , Granada Hospitality Ltd. . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	202	She had been employed as a bowling centre manager until dismissed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	203	She brought a claim for sex discrimination against Granada , asserting she had been dismissed because of pregnancy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	204	That claim was settled . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	205	Subsequently she presented another complaint , asserting that Granada 's refusal to provide a reference to an employment agency was in retaliation for the claim she had previously brought against Granada . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	206	The Employment Appeal Tribunal referred a question to the European Court of Justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	207	The European Court held that the ` principle of effective judicial control ' laid down in article 6 would be deprived of an essential part of its effectiveness if the protection afforded did not cover retaliatory steps . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	208	Fear of such retaliation , if no legal redress were available , might deter employees from pursuing sex discrimination claims . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	209	That would be liable seriously to jeopardise the aim of the Equal Treatment Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	210	The court rejected the United Kingdom government 's argument that retaliatory steps were outside the scope of the directive if taken after the employment relationship had ended : see Coote v Granada Hospitality Ltd -LSB- 1999 -RSB- ICR 100 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	211	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	212	The Employment Appeal Tribunal then resumed its hearing of Ms Coote 's appeal : Coote v Granada Hospitality Ltd -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 1999 -RSB- ICR 942 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	213	In the light of the judgment of the European Court the appeal tribunal , presided over by Morison J , declined to follow Adekeye 's case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	214	The phrase ` in the case of a woman employed by him ' in section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Sex Discrimination Act was capable of embracing the case of a woman ` who has been employed by him ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	215	Thus it was possible to construe section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- in a way which would conform with the Equal Treatment Directive as authoritatively interpreted by the European Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	216	Section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- should be so interpreted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	217	Accordingly , the employment tribunal had jurisdiction to entertain Ms Coote 's claim even though the act of victimisation of which she complained had occurred after her dismissal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	218	The interpretation of the legislation : 'em ployed by him ' and ` whom he employs ' 34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	219	Two points relevant to the interpretation of the legislation are tolerably clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	220	First , the decisions in Adekeye 's case and Coote v Granada Hospitality Ltd -LRB- No 2 -RRB- are inconsistent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	221	Coote 's case was a case of victimisation , Adekeye 's case seemingly was not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	222	But , for the purpose now in hand , it is not possible to differentiate between victimisation and other forms of discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	223	Section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Sex Discrimination Act , containing the phrase 'em ployed by him ' , is a single provision governing all forms of discrimination prohibited by that subsection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	224	The proper interpretation of section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , whatever it may be , applies equally to all forms of discrimination prohibited by that subsection , sex discrimination as defined in sections 1 and 2 as well as victimisation as defined in section 4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	225	The position is the same under section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Race Relations Act and section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Disability Discrimination Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	226	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	227	Next , although this may be more controversial , section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Sex Discrimination Act , section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Race Relations Act and section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Disability Discrimination Act all bear the same meaning on the point now in issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	228	-LRB- In saying this I am leaving aside for the moment any special implications the Equal Treatment Directive may have on the interpretation of the Sex Discrimination Act . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	229	The only distinction between the language of these three Acts is the distinction already mentioned : the Sex Discrimination Act and the Race Relations Act use the phrase 'em ployed by him ' , and the Disability Discrimination Act uses the expression ` whom he employs ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	230	I consider this is a distinction without a difference . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	231	In the context of section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Sex Discrimination Act and section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Race Relations Act , the phrase 'em ployed by him ' , although ambiguous , is more naturally to be read as having the meaning adopted when the phrase was reproduced in section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Disability Discrimination Act : a person ` whom he employs ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	232	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	233	Translated into practical terms , where does this lead ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	234	The context in which these expressions are used includes benefits arising from a contract of employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
254	235	A contract of employment creates an employment relationship between two persons , an employer and an employee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	236	It is a matter of ordinary experience that incidents of the employment relationship thus created often continue beyond the termination of the contract of employment which gave rise to the relationship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	237	When a contract of employment ends the employee ceases to be obliged to work for the employer , and the employer ceases to be obliged to employ the employee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	238	But the ending of these obligations does not normally signify a complete end to all aspects of the relationship between employer and employee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	239	Frequently contractual obligations , express or implied , accrue or continue after the period of employment has come to an end . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	240	An employee may be subject to obligations of confidentiality or restrictions on where he may work or for whom he may work . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	241	An employer may be subject to obligations regarding pension rights or bonus payments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	242	These obligations are matters of contractual right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	243	Frequently also , an employee continues to enjoy , although not as a matter of contractual entitlement , other benefits arising in respect of his employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	244	One important example , of everyday occurrence , is the opportunity to obtain a reference to assist the employee in obtaining a new job . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	245	Another example is the employee 's opportunity to have recourse to internal appeal or grievance procedures in respect of his dismissal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	246	Sometimes this is a matter of contractual right , sometimes not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	247	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	248	To my mind the natural and proper interpretation of section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Sex Discrimination Act and the corresponding provisions in the other two Acts in this context is that once two persons enter into the relationship of employer and employee , the employee is intended to be protected against discrimination by the employer in respect of all the benefits arising from that relationship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	249	The statutory provisions are concerned with the manner in which the employer conducts himself , vis-à-vis the employee , with regard to all the benefits arising from his employment , whether as a matter of strict legal entitlement or not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	250	This being the purpose , it would make no sense to draw an arbitrary line at the precise moment when the contract of employment ends , protecting the employee against discrimination in respect of all benefits up to that point but in respect of none thereafter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	251	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	252	If such a hard and fast line were drawn at this point it would mean that the employee who asks for a reference before he retires from his employment is protected but the employee who asks for a reference the day after he left is not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	253	It would mean that the employee who is dismissed with notice and whose appeal is heard before his notice expires is protected against discrimination in his recourse to the employer 's appeal procedure , but the employee who is dismissed summarily and without notice is not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	254	It would mean that retaliatory action taken by an employer before the contract of employment ends is within the scope of the legislation , but retaliatory action taken later , for instance , regarding bonus payments , is not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	255	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	256	This can not have been the intention of Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	257	Dismissal is one of the matters in respect of which discrimination is expressly prohibited by the statutes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	258	Parliament can not have intended that this prohibition should include an appeal decision regarding dismissal if the appeal is heard before the dismissal takes effect but not if it is heard later . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	259	That would be palpably absurd . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	260	Dismissal can not have been intended to have such an artificially limited meaning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	261	Nor can it have been intended that reprisals may be exacted , so long as they are postponed until after the employee has been dismissed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	262	Nor can a sensible distinction be drawn between giving a reference the day before employment ends and giving a reference the day after . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	263	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	264	I recognise that a line has to be drawn somewhere between what is prohibited and what is not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	265	I recognise also the pioneering character of the anti-discrimination legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	266	Parliament may well have chosen to advance cautiously , one step at a time , while experience accumulates on the practical working of the legislation and guidance is forthcoming from the expert commissions entrusted with the task of keeping the law under review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	267	But these considerations do not point to the conclusion that , when enacting this new form of legislation , Parliament intended to ban discrimination in respect of some of the benefits in respect of an employee 's employment but not others , with the distinction between the two categories being self-evidently capricious . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	268	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	269	Nor am I impressed with the argument that prohibiting post-termination acts of discrimination would expose employers to ` long tail ' liability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	270	Fears have been expressed about the potentially burdensome nature of this liability regarding , in particular , the provision of references . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	271	Liability in respect of post-termination acts of discrimination would , it is said , enable a discontented former employee to harass his former employer , perhaps years later , when he is provided with an unfavourable reference or a reference is refused altogether . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	272	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	273	There are several strands interwoven in this expression of concern . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	274	They must be separated and considered one by one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	275	First , whenever an employer gives a reference for a person currently employed by him he is subject to common law duties of care as well as statutory non-discrimination obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	276	I can see no reason why in this regard the position should be different , or regarded as more onerous , if a reference is provided for a former employee as distinct from a current employee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	277	If an employer provides a reference for a former employee he must do so as fairly as he would for a current employee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	278	Second , regarding refusal to provide a reference , the question of discrimination can only arise if the employer 's normal practice is to provide references for former employees on request . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	279	If that is the employer 's practice , there is surely nothing burdensome in requiring him not to discriminate in the way he implements this practice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	280	He must not treat one former employee less favourably than another on grounds of sex or race or disability or by way of victimisation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	281	If , however , it is not the employer 's practice to give references for former employees , for example , after the lapse of a certain time , then refusal of a reference after that time can not give rise to a well founded discrimination claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	282	In such a case there would be no question of the employer subjecting the former employee to a detriment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	283	Third , the prospect of former employers being harassed with unfounded , vexatious claims can not be a good reason for refusing to entertain well founded claims . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	284	The appropriate response to this understandable concern of employers is for employment tribunals to be alert to strike out manifestly ill founded claims as vexatious . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	285	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	286	For these reasons I respectfully disagree with the decision in Adekeye 's case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	287	I understand the reasoning which attracted the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	288	But I consider this reasoning attaches insufficient importance to the capricious results which follow from a too literal interpretation of the statutory language . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	289	The Adekeye interpretation is insufficiently purposive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	290	It pays insufficient heed to the context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	291	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	292	The preferable approach is to recognise that in each of the relevant statutory provisions the employment relationship is the feature which triggers the employer 's obligation not to discriminate in the stated respects . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	293	This is the connection between two persons which Parliament has identified as requisite for these purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	294	Once triggered , the obligation not to discriminate applies to all the incidents of the employment relationship , whenever precisely they arise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	295	For the reasons already given , this obligation can not sensibly be regarded as confined to the precise duration of the period of employment if there are incidents of the employment which fall to be dealt with after the employment has ended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	296	Some benefits accrue during the period of employment , some afterwards . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	297	For the purposes of discrimination , there is no rational ground for distinguishing the one from the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	298	They all arise equally from the employee 's employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	299	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	300	To be an ` incident ' of the employment relationship for this purpose the benefit in question must arise between employer or former employer as such and employee or former employee as such . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	301	A reference is a prime example . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	302	Further , save perhaps in exceptional circumstances which it is difficult to envisage , failure to provide a non-contractual benefit will not constitute a ` detriment ' , or discrimination in an opportunity to receive a ` benefit ' , within the meaning of the anti-discrimination legislation unless the non-contractual benefit in question is one which normally is provided , or would be provided , to others in comparable circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	303	This is so with regard to current employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	304	It is equally so with former employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	305	But I stress this is not to say that an employer 's practice regarding current employees is to be treated as equally applicable to former employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	306	This is emphatically not so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	307	The two situations are not comparable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	308	What is comparable is the way the employer treats the claimant former employee and the normal way he treats or would treat other former employees in similar circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	309	46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	310	I add , as a footnote , that the question whether the section 6 duty imposed by the Disability Discrimination Act continues after the termination of the contract of employment is a separate question which does not call for decision on these appeals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	311	I prefer to leave that question open . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	312	The appeals 47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	313	I would therefore allow the appeal concerning the four disability discrimination cases . 	lord nicholls	self	outcome	0.2	NAN
254	314	The Employment Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider each of these four victimisation claims . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	315	48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	316	I would also allow Ms Rhys-Harper 's appeal in the sex discrimination case . 	lord nicholls	self	outcome	0.2	NAN
254	317	Whether Ms Rhys-Harper 's claim has any reasonable prospect of success is not a relevant consideration on the issue of jurisdiction which alone is the issue under consideration by the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	318	I should add , in the context of this claim under the Sex Discrimination Act , that I have reached the conclusion expressed above on the proper interpretation of all three Acts without regard to the impact of the Equal Treatment Directive or the decision of the European Court in Coote v Granada Hospitality Ltd -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 1999 -RSB- ICR 942 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	319	Having regard to the conclusion I have reached , it is not necessary to consider the issues arising out of the Equal Treatment Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN

254	321	In the racial discrimination case the London Borough of Lambeth has another string to its bow in seeking to resist Mr D'Souza 's claim on jurisdictional grounds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	322	It will be recalled that the basis of Mr D'Souza 's claim is that the council discriminated against him by refusing to reinstate him as ordered by the employment tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	323	This raises the question whether such a refusal is conduct falling within section 4 of the Race Relations Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN

254	325	I can deal with this issue quite shortly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	326	The effect of the relevant legislation can be summarised as follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN

254	328	It is one of the orders an employment tribunal may make , in the exercise of its discretion , if it upholds an employee 's complaint that he was unfairly dismissed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	329	If an employer fails to reinstate an employee as ordered the tribunal is required to make an award of compensation for wrongful dismissal , with an additional award where the employer fails to satisfy the tribunal that it was not practicable to comply with the order : see sections 68 , 69 and 71 of the Employment Protection -LRB- Consolidation -RRB- Act 1978 , now sections 112 , 113 , 114 and 117 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	330	51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	331	In my view the benefit acquired by an employee from a reinstatement order can not be regarded as a benefit within the meaning of section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Race Relations Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	332	It does not arise from the employment relationship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	333	It derives from an order of the tribunal , made in the exercise of its discretion , after the employee has been unfairly dismissed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	334	Such an order is a discretionary statutory remedy for unfair dismissal , attracting its own sanctions in the event of non-compliance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	335	Nor , for the like reason , can the employer 's failure to comply with the order be regarded as a detriment within section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	336	52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	337	Nor does the case fall within section 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	338	Lambeth 's conduct is not readily characterised as ` deliberately omitting to offer ' Mr D'Souza employment within the meaning of section 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	339	The nature of Lambeth 's act was different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	340	Lambeth was not in the normal position of a prospective employer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	341	What Lambeth did was to fail to comply with a tribunal order which required the council to restore an employee to the employment from which he had been dismissed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	342	That characterisation , coupled with the feature that the statute itself provides remedies for non-compliance with a reinstatement order , points strongly away from this circumstance being within section 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- of the Race Relations Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	343	I would so hold . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	344	53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	345	Since , then , the discriminatory conduct alleged by Mr D'Souza does not fall within the ambit of section 4 of the Race Relations Act , the employment tribunal has no jurisdiction to entertain his complaint . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	346	For this reason I would dismiss Mr D'Souza 's appeal . 	lord nicholls	self	outcome	0.2	NAN

254	351	These three appeals raise an important point about the present state of the law which prohibits discrimination in the field of employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	352	Common to all three is an issue of statutory construction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	353	In three separate enactments Parliament has made it unlawful for employers to discriminate on the grounds of sex , race and disability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	354	It is not in doubt that statutory protection against discrimination and victimisation has been given to prospective and existing employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	355	The area of doubt to which these appeals have been directed relates to the position of ex-employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
254	356	The question is whether the statutory protection extends to persons who are no longer employed by the employer and , if so , in what circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN

254	446	The principal issue 73 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	447	Section 62 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 provides that a contravention of the Act shall incur as such no sanction , whether civil or criminal , except to the extent -LRB- if any -RRB- expressly provided by that Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	448	Section 63 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of that Act provides that a complaint by any person that another person has committed an act of discrimination against the complainant which is unlawful by virtue of Part II of the Act may be presented to an employment tribunal , and section 65 sets out the remedies that may be given by the tribunal if it finds that a complaint presented under section 63 is well founded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	449	Provisions to the same effect are to be found in sections 53 , 54 and 56 of the Race Relations Act 1976 and in section 8 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	450	The effect of these provisions is that complaints of discrimination on grounds of sex , race and disability in the employment field must be presented to an employment tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	451	The question of law which is common to all these cases is whether the employment tribunal has jurisdiction to consider a complaint of discrimination which relates to only acts which are alleged to have taken place after the complainant 's employment has come to an end . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	452	74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	453	The answer to this question depends on the meaning which is to be given in its context to the phrase `` employed by him '' in section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Race Relations Act 1976 and to the phrase `` whom he employs '' in section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	454	As Lord Bingham of Cornhill observed in Anyanwu v South Bank Student Union -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 1 WLR 638 , 640 , this is a trio of Acts which contain similar provisions , although they are directed to different forms of discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	455	It is plain that , when Parliament used the same phrase `` employed by him '' in section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Race Relations Act 1976 as it used in section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 , it must have intended that it should be given the same meaning in each of these two Acts .

254	456	The wording of the equivalent phrase in section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 is slightly different , and there are other differences in the layout and wording of that Act in comparison with the Acts which deal with discrimination on the grounds of sex and race .

254	459	At the end of the hearing of the appeal in Mrs Rhys-Harper 's case a further issue was raised by Mr Reynold QC on her behalf . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	460	Her complaint had been presented hitherto as a complaint about discrimination after the employment relationship had ended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	461	But in his closing speech Mr Reynold submitted that , as her allegation of sexual harassment was made in the course of her appeal against dismissal , her complaint had a direct bearing on the part played by Mr Adamson who investigated and rejected that complaint and was the decision-taker in her appeal against her dismissal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	462	He accepted that the nexus between her complaint of sexual discrimination in his handling of that allegation and his decision in the appeal against dismissal had not been made clear previously . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	463	The point which he sought now to put in issue was that , on a correct analysis of the facts , this was a case of continuing discrimination by victimisation which could be related to the employer 's act in dismissing her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	464	76 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	465	In Mrs Rhys-Harper 's case it will also be necessary to take account of the fact that the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 gave effect in domestic law to Council Directive 76/207/EEC -LRB- `` the Equal Treatment Directive '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	466	This is a feature which is absent from the other two cases , as the legislation which dealt with discrimination on grounds of race and disability had no equivalent base under the EC Treaty when it was enacted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	467	Council Directive 2000/43/EEC -LRB- `` the Race Directive '' -RRB- was adopted under article 13 of the EC Treaty by the United Kingdom and other member states in 2000 , but it does not have to be implemented until 19 July 2003 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

254	470	A further question of law is raised by the case of D'Souza , as he has an alternative argument that the decision of his former employer not to reinstate him when ordered to do so by the Employment Tribunal was a breach of section 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Race Relations Act 1976 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	471	The question is whether , when it refused to do so , his employer was `` refusing or omitting to offer him '' that employment within the meaning of section 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- of that Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	472	A brief history of the legislation 78 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	473	It is a remarkable fact that , although discrimination on whatever grounds is widely regarded as morally unacceptable , the common law was unable to provide a sound basis for removing it from situations where those who were vulnerable to discrimination were at risk and ensuring that all people were treated equally . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	474	Experience has taught us that this is a matter which can only be dealt with by legislation , and that it requires careful regulation by Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	475	The Community has adopted the same approach in its promotion of the principle of equal treatment as part of its social action programme . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	476	The fact is that the principle of equal treatment is easy to state but difficult to apply in practice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	477	In the result the legislation which is under scrutiny in these appeals is designed to be specific and particular rather than universal in its application , and it is still being developed incrementally . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

254	488	The contractual aspects were dealt with by an amendment to section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Equal Pay Act 1970 which substituted for the equal pay clause which was deemed to be included in every contract of employment by that subsection a more broadly framed equality clause . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

254	490	Some indication of the common understanding of the scope of the Act when it was enacted is given by the comment in a general note by the annotator in Current Law Statutes that section 6 `` provides the general prohibition of discrimination by an employer between prospective and existing employees .

254	516	An issue was raised as to the meaning to be given to the words `` provision in relation to death or retirement '' in section 6 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 in the light of article 119 of the EEC Treaty -LRB- now article 141 EC -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
254	517	It was held , following a reference to the European Court of Justice , that the scheme was not covered by the exception in section 6 -LRB- 4 -RRB- because these words should not be construed so widely as to include a privilege which had existed during employment and was allowed by the employer to continue after retirement .

254	523	Knox J said at p 531 that the whole provision was couched in the present tense and that , if it had been intended to include benefits , facilities or services or detriments post employment , Parliament would certainly have made it explicit that that extended meaning was the correct one and it had not done so .

254	524	In Post Office v Adekeye -LSB- 1995 -RSB- ICR 540 the Employment Appeal Tribunal held , for the same reasons , that the tribunal had not jurisdiction to hear a complaint about racial discrimination at an internal appeal hearing by a person who was pursing an appeal against her dismissal .

254	558	The language of the legislation : introduction 89 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	559	The critical words in section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Race Relations Act 1976 are `` employed by him '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

254	565	The Court of Appeal held that , in the absence of any express extension of the term `` employee '' to include a person whose employment had ceased , the words `` a person employed by him '' in section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Race Relations Act 1975 when given their ordinary and natural meaning in their context excluded a person whose employment had ceased at the time of the act of discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	566	Peter Gibson LJ , with whose judgment Pill and Hirst LJJ agreed , said at p 118 : `` I accept the submission of Mr Greening for the Post Office that , giving the words ` in the case of a person employed by him ' their ordinary and natural meaning in their context , those words mean , and can only mean , ` in the case of a person who is employed by him .

254	567	I note that that person is referred to in the next line as ` that employee ' which is again suggestive of a present and not a past employee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	568	... Further , as Smith J pointed out in -LSB- 1995 -RSB- ICR 540 , 544-545 , the definition of 'em ployee ' in section 153 of the Employment Protection -LRB- Consolidation -RRB- Act 1978 -LRB- which re-enacted the definition in section 167 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Industrial Relations Act 1971 -RRB- was expressly extended to include a person whose employment had ceased . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	569	It is significant that there is no equivalent extension in the Act of 1976 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	570	I therefore conclude that the appeal tribunal was right to hold that section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Race Relations Act 1976 protects only those whose employment continues at the time of the act of discrimination . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

254	573	In Rhys-Harper v Relaxion Group plc -LSB- 2001 -RSB- ICR 1176 , 1185 , para 25 , Buxton LJ said that he found entirely persuasive the conclusion of Peter Gibson LJ that , when one read the words in section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Race Relations Act 1976 which are the equivalent of section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 , it was inescapable that what was addressed was events occurring during the actual course of employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	574	After quoting the words of section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- he said in para 26 : `` The concept of a person affording ` access ' to benefits to a woman 'em ployed ' by him only makes sense when directed to conduct taking place during the employment relationship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	575	If what was addressed here was conduct towards former employees , not only would that be spelled out in terms , but also language a good deal different from that of providing access to facilities would be used . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	576	He said that he agreed with Peter Gibson LJ 's conclusion that strong indications of post-contract activity within the events listed in that subsection , going beyond mere possibilities , would be needed in order to compel a reading of ' a person employed by him ' in the unnatural sense of a person previously employed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	577	In paragraph 4 of his judgment in D'Souza v London Borough of Lambeth -LSB- 2001 -RSB- EWCA Civ 794 Schiemann LJ said that the Court of Appeal at the time regarded the decision in Adekeye -LSB- 1997 -RSB- ICR 110 as unsatisfactory but inescapable in the light of the wording of section 4 of the Race Relations Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	578	He also said that it was fair to point out that , despite that expression of dissatisfaction , Parliament in passing the Race Relations -LRB- Amendment -RRB- Act 2000 , had not seen fit to alter section 4 of the earlier Act in any relevant respect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	579	In paragraph 23 of his judgment in Kirker v British Sugar plc and Others -LSB- 2002 -RSB- ICR 1124 Mummery LJ observed the result of his reading of section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 was consistent with the decisions in Adekeye , Rhys-Harper and D'Souza . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	580	But , as he said in para 25 , the wording of section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1995 Act is different from that in the two other discrimination Acts , so it would have been possible for a different view to be taken as its meaning in their case without affecting the construction of the 1995 Act .

254	581	92 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	582	In para 14 of his judgment in Kirker v British Sugar plc Mummery LJ said that on their plain and ordinary meaning the words of section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1995 Act expressly conferred protection from discrimination by an employer on only two classes of disabled person : first , job applicants , and , secondly , persons `` whom he employs '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	583	He referred to the fact that the words `` whom he employs '' is couched in the present tense , which naturally referred to a contractual employment relationship existing at the date of the commission of any of the particular kinds of act referred to in the subsection all of which were plainly referable to events occurring in the course of an existing employment relationship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	584	It was contended in that case that this result was unsatisfactory , arbitrary and contrary to the statutory purpose of the enactment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	585	In paragraph 21 he responded to this argument in this way : `` In my judgment , the meaning of the language of section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- is so plain that , as a matter of construction , the court would not be justified in departing from its natural meaning in order to avoid the predicted consequences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	586	I would add that some surprising consequences might be thought to flow from the construction of section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- proposed by the applicants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	587	For example , a disabled employee , who was fairly dismissed for misconduct after a month of employment , would be entitled for the rest of his life to make claims of discrimination and victimisation against his former employer who would be potentially liable , even for subconscious acts of discrimination and victimisation -LRB- see Nagarajan v London Regional Transport -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 1AC 501 -RRB- in respect of post-termination acts committed many years later , such as the provision or non-provision of a reference . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	588	93 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	589	In contrast to the position which has been adopted by the Court of Appeal , Morison J has made his disgreement with the decision in Adekeye clear on at least two occasions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	590	In Coote v Granada Ltd -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 1999 -RSB- ICR 942 , a case under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 which was decided following a reference to the European Court of Justice , he said at p 949 that it seemed to the tribunal that the present tense would have been quite apt had the section been intended to apply to former employees since what is made unlawful is a present act of discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	591	He summed the position up at p 950 : `` We have not been persuaded that it could be said that the Court of Appeal 's decision was so mistaken -LRB- per incuriam -RRB- that it need not be followed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	592	We quite see the force of the criticisms made of it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	593	Indeed , we would go further and respectfully say that we disagree with it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	594	But the doctrine of precedent requires us to follow it and , had it been applicable to this case , we would have done so '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	595	In D'Souza v London Borough of Lambeth -LRB- EAT , unreported , 27 June 2000 -RRB- he said in para 6 : `` It seems to us that we are bound by the decision of Adekeye which must be faithfully followed , although we do so without relish . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	596	We can see a strong argument for adopting a purposive approach to section 4 and make it elastic enough to cover acts of discrimination against former employers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	597	The employment relationship , in the most general sense , outlives the contractual relationship : there are references , pension matters , sports clubs and other post employment events which links an ex employee with his former employer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	598	It would be intolerable if an employer could blacken the former employee in the market place because he had successfully sued his former employer in a tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	599	If people are frightened by what happens to them if they make a complaint , the evil of discrimination will be more likely to live on . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	600	Not all perks and privileges for retired staff could be considered contractual and it is difficult to understand why , if they are dealt with in a discriminatory way , they should not be covered by the Act , since there may be no other available remedy . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	601	94 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	602	Against this background which indicates that there are powerful views on either side of the argument , I now turn to the language of the statutes themselves . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	603	I shall take them in their historical order , although it will not be necessary to say much about the Race Relations Act 1976 as the wording which it uses is so close to that of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	604	The language of the legislation : the words themselves 95 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	605	What is the meaning which is to be given in its context to the phrase `` employed by him '' in section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Race Relations Act 1976 and to the phrase `` whom he employs '' in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	606	I propose to examine this question by stages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	607	I shall start with the wording of section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1975 Act itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	608	Then I shall look at other provisions in order to determine how the critical phrase falls to be read in its context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	609	Then I shall look at section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1976 Act in its context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	610	I shall deal finally with the slightly different wording of section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1995 Act in its context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	611	-LRB- a -RRB- Sex Discrimination Act 1975 , s 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- : `` employed by him '' 96 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	612	The word `` employed '' can serve either as an adjective or as a participle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	613	If it is to serve as an adjective it will be attached to a noun . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	614	Here there is no noun , so at least one can say that it is being used in the subsection as a participle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	615	But if it is to serve as a participle , the question whether it is being used as a past participle or as a present participle will depend on the tense of the verb with which it is associated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	616	Here there is no verb . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	617	That is not to say that a verb can not be read in to the subsection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	618	But this requires an understanding of the intention of Parliament , and the participle itself gives no indication as to the tense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	619	So the phrase `` employed by him '' without more is ambiguous . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	620	97 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	621	As soon as one beings to examine the context , however , the ambiguity beings to recede . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	622	The phrase `` in the case of a woman employed by him at an establishment in Great Britain '' , taken together with the words `` in the way he affords her access to opportunities for promotion , transfer or training '' the first part of paragraph -LRB- a -RRB- indicates beyond doubt that existing employees fall within the phrase `` employed by him '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	623	But it also suggests that it is only existing employees who do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	624	This impression is reinforced by the words `` by dismissing her '' in paragraph -LRB- b -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	625	If Parliament had intended it to deal with ex-employees as well , one would have expected it to have said so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	626	The reference to `` any other benefits , facilities or services '' in paragraph -LRB- a -RRB- and `` subjecting her to any other detriment '' in paragraph -LRB- b -RRB- are not so plainly related to things done to existing employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	627	They could include acts of discrimination after the employment has come to an end , and it is by no means impossible for the subsection as whole to be read in this way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	628	But it is not obvious that this is what Parliament intended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	629	Elsewhere in section 6 , subsection -LRB- 7 -RRB- states that subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- does not apply to benefits , facilities or services of any description if the employer `` is '' concerned with the provision of these things to the public , or to a section of the public comprising the woman in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	630	It then sets out three exceptions to this provision - -LRB- a -RRB- the provision differs in a material respect from the provision of these things by the employer to `` his employees '' , -LRB- b -RRB- the provision of these things to the woman `` is regulated '' by her contract of employment and -LRB- c -RRB- they relate to training . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	631	This provision appears to have been designed on the assumption that the situation with which subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- is dealing is that which applies where the contract of employment is still on foot , not after it has come to an end . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	632	98 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	633	Two other provisions in first group of sections in Part II of the 1975 Act which deal with employers indicate that Parliament did not address itself to the position of their ex-employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	634	Section 9 makes it unlawful for a person to discriminate against a woman who `` is a contract worker '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	635	Among the things he may not do is discriminate against her in the provision of `` any benefits , facilities or services '' or by subjecting her to `` any other detriment '' - phrases that are repeated from section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	636	An exception is made for benefits , facilities or services if the person `` is '' concerned with the provision of these things to the public , as in section 6 -LRB- 7 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	637	Section 10 deals with the meaning of employment at an establishment in Great Britain in terms which make use throughout of the present tense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	638	The second group of sections in Part II deals with discrimination by other bodies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	639	Section 11 deals with partnerships . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	640	It makes it unlawful for a firm to discriminate against a woman who is seeking a position as partner and against a woman `` who already holds that position '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	641	But it makes no mention of women who are no longer partners but who may - for example - be seeking a reference . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	642	Section 12 , which deals with membership of trade unions , follows the same pattern . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	643	It protects a woman who is applying for membership and a woman who `` is '' a member of the organisation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	644	But it makes no mention of a woman who is no longer a member . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	645	99 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	646	I would hold that , taken overall and when given their ordinary meaning in their context , these provisions indicate that the phrase `` employed by him '' in section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1975 Act includes a woman who is employed by the alleged discriminator but that it does not include a woman who is no longer employed by him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	647	Race Relations Act 1976 , s 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- : `` employed by him '' 100 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	648	I can see no grounds for giving a different meaning to the phrase in this context from that which I would give to it in section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	649	The wording of section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1976 Act is precisely the same except that it refers to a person where section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- in the 1975 Act refers to a woman . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	650	The wording of section 4 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the 1976 Act matches that of section 6 -LRB- 7 -RRB- of the 1975 Act , and sections 7 , 8 , 10 and 11 of the 1976 Act deal with contract workers , the meaning of employment at an establishment in Great Britain , partnerships and membership of trade unions in the same way as these matters are dealt with in the corresponding sections of the 1975 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	651	101 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	652	So I would that the phrase `` employed by him '' in section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1976 Act includes a person who is employed by the alleged discriminator , but that it does not include a person who is no longer employed by him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	653	-LRB- c -RRB- Disability Discrimination Act 1995 , s 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- : `` whom he employs '' 102 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	654	The first thing that strikes one about the language of this subsection is that it does not use the participle `` employed '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	655	It uses instead the verb `` employs '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	656	As my noble and learned friend Lord Rodger of Earlsferry observed in the course of the argument , this was an odd choice of language if the draftsman 's instructions were to cover the position of persons who were no longer employed by the alleged discriminator . 	lord hope	lord rodger	partagr	0.4	NAN
254	657	And it was odd too , if those were his instructions , that this was not picked up during the passage of the Bill through Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	658	So in this case one starts from the position that the ordinary and natural meaning of the phrase is that it includes a person who is employed by the alleged discriminator , but that it does not include a person who is no longer employed by him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	659	The question is whether there is anything in the context which requires that the phrase be read differently so that it includes a person who is no longer employed by the alleged discriminator . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	660	103 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	661	I can find nothing in section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- itself which points to a different conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	662	Section 4 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1995 Act , like its counterparts in sections 6 -LRB- 7 -RRB- and 4 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the 1975 and 1976 Acts , is cast in the present tense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	663	So too are sections 12 and 13 of the 1995 Act which deal with discrimination against contract workers and by trade organisations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	664	There are number of other more subtle indications that the focus of this Act was on applicants for employment and those in employment , not those on those whose employment has come to an end : see , for example , the wording of the exemption for small businesses in section 7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	665	I can find no support anywhere else in the Act for the argument that section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- extends to persons who are no longer in the employment of the alleged discriminator . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	666	Community Law 104 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	667	In Mrs Rhys-Harper 's case it is necessary , as I said earlier -LRB- see para 23 -RRB- , to take account of the fact that the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 gave effect in domestic law to Council Directive 76/207/EEC -LRB- `` the Equal Treatment Directive '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	668	The conclusion which one draws from this exercise may have implications for all the other cases too , as I shall explain later . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	669	The Directive does not , of course , have direct effect on the relationship between a woman and her employer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	670	The third paragraph of article 249 of the EC Treaty -LRB- formerly article 189 EEC -RRB- provides that a directive shall be binding , as to the result to be achieved , upon each member state to which it is addressed but that it shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and method . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	671	So a directive works its way into our domestic system by means of the legislation which is designed to give effect to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	672	It is then for the courts to interpret that legislation , as far as possible , in a way that gives effect to this country 's obligations under the treaty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	673	105 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	674	In Litster v Forth Dry Dock and Engineering Co Ltd -LSB- 1990 -RSB- 1 AC 546 , 559E-F Lord Oliver of Aylmerton said that the approach to the construction of primary and subordinate legislation enacted to give effect to the United Kingdom 's obligations under the EEC treaty was not in doubt : `` If the legislation can reasonably be construed so as to conform with those obligations - obligations which are to be ascertained not only from the wording of the relevant directive but from the interpretation placed on it by the European Court of Justice at Luxembourg - such a purposive construction will be applied even though , perhaps , it may involve some departure from the strict and literal application of the words which the legislature has elected to use . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	675	In Webb v Emo Air Cargo -LRB- UK -RRB- Ltd -LSB- 1983 -RSB- ICR 175 , 186 Lord Keith of Kinkel said : '' ... it is for a United Kingdom court to construe domestic legislation in any field covered by a Community Directive so as to accord with the interpretation of the Directive as laid down by the European Court of Justice , if that can be done without distorting the meaning of the domestic legislation ... '' At p 187 he referred to the way in which the European Court in Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentacion SA -LRB- Case C-106 / 89 -RRB- -LSB- 1990 -RSB- ECR I-4135 expressed the obligation which is binding on the courts in applying national law , whether the provisions in question were adopted before or after the directive : `` As the European Court of Justice said , a national court must construe a domestic law to accord with the terms of a directive in the same field only if it is possible to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	676	That means that the domestic law must be open to an interpretation consistent with the directive whether or not it is also open to an interpretation inconsistent with it . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	677	The European Court took the opportunity in Coote v Granada Hospitality Ltd -LRB- Case C-185 / 97 -RRB- -LSB- 1999 -RSB- ICR100 , 111-112 , para 18 to re-state this point : `` As follows from Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentacion SA -LRB- Case C-106 / 89 -RRB- -LSB- 1990 -RSB- ECR I-4135 , 4159 , para 8 and Wagner Miret v Fondo de garantia salarial -LRB- Case C-334 / 92 -RRB- -LSB- 1993 -RSB- ECR I-6911 , 6932 , paras 20 and 21 , in applying national law , in particular legislative provisions which , as in the present case , were specially introduced in order to implement the Directive , the national court is required to interpret its national law , so far as possible , in the light of the wording and the purpose of the Directive in order to achieve the result pursued by the third paragraph of article 189 of the EC Treaty .

254	679	The phrase `` employed by him '' in section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 is , as I have said , ambiguous . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	680	I think that it is possible to construe it as referring to a woman who is no longer employed by the alleged discriminator as well as to a person who is employed by him , although I do not think that that is what the phrase means when domestic rules of construction are applied to it and it is taken in its context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	681	So the question which arises in Mrs Rhys-Harpers ' case is whether Directive 76/207/EEC , as interpreted by the European Court , requires us to adopt that possible construction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	682	107 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	683	There is nothing in the wording of the Directive which makes it plain to the domestic reader that its purpose was to extend the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment to cases where the employment relationship has come to an end . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	684	It refers in its long title to `` the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment , vocational training and promotion , and working conditions . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	685	The preamble too refers to access to employment , training and promotion and to `` working conditions , including pay '' , as does article 1 which describes the purpose of the Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	686	One finds here the familiar categories of people seeking employment , training or promotion on the one hand and those who are in work on the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	687	Nothing is said about ex-employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	688	108 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	689	The articles which are most directly in point with regard to the question what scope is to be given to the expression `` working conditions '' are these : `` Article 5 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	690	Application of the principle of equal treatment with regard to working conditions , including the conditions governing dismissal , means that men and women shall be guaranteed the same conditions without discrimination on grounds of sex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

Article 6 Member States shall introduce into their national legal systems such measures as are necessary to enable all persons who consider themselves wronged by failure to apply to them the principle of equal treatment within the meaning of articles 3 , 4 and 5 to pursue their claims by judicial process after possible recourse to other competent authorities .

254	695	109 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	696	What then is to be said about the purpose of the Directive ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	697	Here one must turn for guidance to the decision of the European Court in Coote v Granada Hospitality Ltd -LSB- 1999 -RSB- ICR 100 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	698	In that case , after settling a sex discrimination claim against her employer , the applicant had left the employer 's employment by mutual consent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	699	She then asked the employer to supply a reference to the employment agency through which she was trying to find another job . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	700	This was refused . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	701	She then brought proceedings against the employer under section 4 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 , which deals with victimisation , in which she alleged that this response was a reprisal for her previous claim of sex discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	702	110 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	703	The European Court saw this as an issue of judicial protection within the meaning of article 6 of the Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
254	704	It explained its approach in -LSB- 1999 -RSB- ICR 100 , 112 , para 19 : `` In those circumstances , the questions put by the national court must be understood as seeking to ascertain , for the purpose of interpreting national provisions transposing Directive -LRB- 76/207/EEC -RRB- , whether the Directive requires member states to introduce into their national legal systems such measures as are necessary to ensure judicial protection for workers whose employer , after the end of the employment relationship , refuses to provide references as a reaction to proceedings brought to enforce compliance with the principle of equal treatment within the meaning of the Directive .

254	707	The court noted in para 20 that it followed from article 6 that the member states must ensure that the rights conferred by the Directive could be effectively relied on before the national courts by the persons concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	708	In para 21 it observed that the requirement laid down by that article reflected a general principle of law which underlies the constitutional traditions common to the member states and which was also enshrined in article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	709	In para 23 it emphasised that article 6 of the Directive was an essential factor for attaining the fundamental objective of equal treatment for men and women which , as the court had repeatedly held , was one of the fundamental human rights whose observance it had a duty to ensure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	710	In para 24 it said that the principle of effective judicial control which article 6 of the Directive lays down would be deprived of an essential part of its effectiveness if it did not cover measures which the employer took as a reaction to legal proceedings brought by the employee with the aim of enforcing the principle of equal treatment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	711	The conclusion which it expressed in para 25 was that it was not possible to accept the argument that such measures did not fall within the scope of the Directive if they are taken after the employment relationship has ended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	712	112 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	713	It would have been possible for the court to find a more direct answer to the problem in article 5 of the Directive regarding working conditions as indicated by Advocate General Mischo in his opinion at p 104 , paras 11-12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	714	He said that an employer 's appraisal of the quality of the services rendered fell entirely within the scope of the relationship between employee and employer , and that the service rendered by the employer in providing the employee with what he described as `` the parting gift '' of a reference could not be severed from the employment relationship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	715	He also said that the conditions regarding dismissal were to be construed broadly , as was clear from Burton v British Railways Board -LRB- Case 19/81 -RRB- -LSB- 1982 -RSB- ICR 328 , 348 , para 9 where the court said that in the context of the directive the word `` dismissal '' must be widely construed so as to include termination of the employment relationship between a worker and his employer , even as part of a voluntary redundancy scheme . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	716	But the court did not go down that road . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	717	The principle underlying its approach was the right of a person who claimed to have been discriminated against by her employer to obtain an effective remedy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	718	113 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	719	The conclusion which I would draw from this case is that the interpretation placed on the Directive by the European Court does not require your Lordships to read the words `` employed by him '' in section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Sex Discrimination Act as including each and every case where the employment relationship has come to an end . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	720	If that reading of those words were to be adopted it would enable all ex-employees to claim that they were entitled to the benefit of that subsection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	721	It would extend the principle of equal treatment to them as a class , without regard to the question which was of concern to the court which was that the rights conferred by the Directive could be relied upon effectively in the courts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	722	It would also raise problems which the court did not address about the scope of the employer 's liability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	723	If the protection were to be extended to ex-employees as a class without some words of qualification , employers would be exposed to a potential liability for unconscious and perhaps trivial acts of discrimination for the rest of the employee 's life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	724	There is no indication in court 's decision that it saw this as one of the purposes of the Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	725	The Advocate General 's description of a reference as a `` parting gift '' which could not be severed from the employment relationship suggests that he regarded the expression `` working conditions '' in article 5 as referring to things that fell within the employment relationship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	726	114 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	727	It is to be noted however that the expression which the European Court used in Coote at p 112 , para 19 to describe the period which falls within the scope of the Directive was `` the employment relationship '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	728	Buxton LJ used the same phrase in Rhys-Harper v Relaxion Group plc -LSB- 2001 -RSB- ICR 1176 , 1185 , para 25 when he said that he agreed with Peter Gibson LJ 's conclusion in Post Office v Adkeye -LSB- 1997 -RSB- ICR 110 that strong indications of post-contract activity would be needed within the events listed in section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- in order to compel a reading of `` a person employed by him '' in what he described as `` the unnatural sense '' of a person previously employed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	729	But , as my noble and learned friend Lord Scott of Foscote has pointed out , the relationship between the employer and the employee does not necessarily come to an end at the precise moment when their contract terminates . 	lord hope	lord scott	partagr	0.5	NAN
254	730	There may well be things that need to be done to bring their relationship to an end after the contract has terminated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	731	There may also have been agreements entered into during the employment about benefits to be enjoyed afterwards , such as the continued use of sports facilities , which remain to be implemented or there may be evidence that it is the employer 's practice to allow the continued use of such facilities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	732	At that stage the employer will , of course , be dealing with someone who strictly speaking is a former employee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	733	But the fact that this description applies will not of itself remove that person from the scope of the Directive , so long as the transactions that remain to be completed are attributable to a continuation of their relationship as employer and employee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	734	115 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	735	I think that the approach which is indicated by the decision in Coote strikes a reasonable balance between the interests of the employee after the employment is ended and the risk to the employer of being exposed to claims indefinitely . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	736	I would extend the same meaning to the words `` employed by him '' in section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and , as I see no grounds for giving a different meaning to the same words where they appear in section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Race Relations Act 1976 , to those words in that context also . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	737	That being so , as there are no rational grounds for a different approach to be taken to the use of similar language in the context of discrimination against disability , I would extend the same meaning to the words `` whom he employs '' in section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	738	Whether or not there is still an employment relationship will be for determination according to the facts of each case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	739	116 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	740	I would therefore , with respect , differ from the decision of the Court of Appeal in Adekeye 's case that the words `` a person employed by him '' in section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Race Relations ct 1975 did not apply to a person who was no longer an employee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	741	That approach , which confines the scope of the protection strictly to the duration of the contract , seems to be out of keeping with the approach of the European Court in Coote when it used the expression `` the employment relationship '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN

254	744	The issue in this case , as focused in the agreed statement of facts and issues , is whether , on a proper construction of section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 , an employment tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain a claim of sex discrimination where the act or conduct complained of occurred after the employment relationship has ended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	745	In his opening remarks Mr Reynold QC for the appellant said this was what her case was about . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	746	He said that her complaint was that she had been sexually discriminated against after her employment had come to an end because the respondent 's general manager , Mr Adamson , failed to investigate properly a complaint which she made at the hearing of her appeal against her dismissal on 9 November 1998 that she had been harassed on the ground of her sex by Mr Osborn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	747	Mr Reynold did not suggest that Mr Adamson 's investigation into this complaint had any bearing on his decision that there were sufficient grounds for the appellant 's dismissal and that Mr Osborn 's decision to dismiss her should stand . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	748	118 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	749	I would hold that section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of that Act does not apply to the appellant 's complaint of discrimination as so presented . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	750	What is alleged is a single and self-contained act of discrimination , which is said to have occurred when the appellant was no longer employed by the respondent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	751	As for the wider question whether it was attributable to a continuation of their employment relationship , I would hold that there is nothing in this way of presenting her case which links the alleged act of discrimination by Mr Adamson to the conditions of her employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	752	The appellant did not ask Mr Adamson to investigate her complaint , and there has been no suggestion that she had any right to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	753	She was no longer employed in the respondent 's premises , so she was not in a position to benefit in any way from any decisions that Mr Adamson might have taken as a result of that investigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	754	Nor is there anything in it that links Mr Adamson 's alleged failure to investigate this complaint properly to the appeal and his decision to confirm her dismissal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	755	119 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	756	But Mr Reynold sought to present her case in a different way when he was replying to Mr Reade QC for the respondent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	757	He based this presentation of it on the fact that the appellant received two letters from Mr Adamson on the same day . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	758	One of these letters dealt with the outcome of the appellant 's appeal against her dismissal by Mr Osborn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	759	In the other Mr Adamson said that the allegation which the appellant made at the hearing of her appeal of sexual harassment by Mr Osborn had been investigated and that there was insufficient evidence to establish a case against him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	760	Mr Reynold said that fact that these two letters arrived together showed that Mr Adamson 's decision in the appeal was linked to his investigation into the appellant 's allegation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	761	The allegation had arisen in the course of her appeal against her dismissal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	762	What the appellant was alleging therefore was bias on the part of Mr Adamson as the decision-taker in her appeal against her dismissal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	763	Mr Reynold said that it was not realistic to divorce the appeal procedure from the ambit of the allegation of sexual harassment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	764	The reality was that they were part and parcel of the same thing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	765	120 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	766	This presentation of the appellant 's case makes it necessary to examine the history of her allegations against Mr Osborn more closely . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	767	According to a transcript of the notes of evidence of the chairman of the employment tribunal , the appellant said in her evidence that she did not bring the issue of sexual discrimination up when she attended the disciplinary hearing on 12 October 1998 which was conducted by Mr Osborn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	768	She said that this because he was the perpetrator and because his girl friend was there . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	769	But the fact is that , for whatever reason , she did not mention this issue at the hearing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	770	Moreover , she made no mention of sexual discrimination in her letter of 19 October 1998 in which she appealed against Mr Osborn 's decision to dismiss her on the ground of misconduct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	771	It was not until she saw Mr Adamson at the appeal hearing on 9 November 1998 that she mentioned the issue for the first time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	772	She mentioned it again when she was setting out the details of her complaint in her application to the employment tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	773	She said that she was putting forward a complaint of sexual harassment and constructive dismissal against Mr Osborn , and gave details of various problems of this nature which she had encountered with him during her employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	774	At the end of this document that she said that she felt that she had been sacked for misconduct once she had reported the sexual harassment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	775	But the history which I have outlined shows that she did not make any such report until she mentioned the matter to Mr Adamson in the course of the hearing of her appeal against her dismissal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	776	121 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	777	Although Mr Reynold did not put her case quite in these terms , it appears to me in the light of this further background that the case which he was seeking to put forward in his reply was that the appellant had been victimised within the meaning of section 4 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 by Mr Adamson in his conduct of the hearing of the appeal against her dismissal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	778	Mr Reynold said that the appellant 's case was that Mr Adamson 's decision in the appeal was biased against her because of the complaint which she had made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	779	An employment tribunal does not have jurisdiction under section 63 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 to investigate an allegation of bias on the part of the decision-taker in an appeal by an employee against her dismissal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	780	But it does have jurisdiction under that section to deal with a complaint that she has been the victim of an act of discrimination by way of victimisation within the meaning of section 4 of the 1975 Act which is unlawful under Part II of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	781	122 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	782	In my opinion there is no doubt that an employment tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain a complaint of discrimination by way of victimisation which relates to conduct by an employer in his determination of an appeal by a woman against her dismissal from his employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	783	Article 7 of Directive 76/207/EEC requires member states to take the necessary measures to protect employees against dismissal by the employer as a reaction to a complaint within the undertaking aimed at enforcing compliance with the principle of equal treatment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	784	Section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- of the 1975 makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against a woman by dismissing her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	785	Discrimination within the meaning of section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- includes discrimination by way of victimisation as defined by section 4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	786	Section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- , when read together with section 4 , provides the protection which article 7 requires . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	787	An act of dismissal by way of victimisation is made unlawful by section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	788	So there is no need here for the appellant to rely on the obligation to ensure effective judicial control for the protection of the rights provided by the Directive arising from article 6 which the European Court of Justice described in Coote v Granada Hospitality Ltd -LSB- 1999 -RSB- ICR 100 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	789	The issues of statutory interpretation on this presentation of her case appear to me to be to be quite straightforward . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	790	The appellant 's difficulty lies in the fact that her complaint that she was victimised by Mr Adamson in the course of the proceedings regarding her dismissal was not presented in this way at any stage in these proceedings until it was mentioned by Mr Reynold in his closing address to your Lordships . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN

254	793	There are various ways in which the facts can be analysed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	794	But however this is done it would , as Mr Reynold said , be unrealistic to ignore the fact that the victimisation of which she complains was part and parcel of the events that were attributable to her employer 's act in dismissing her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN

254	802	I would hold that section 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- does not apply to his case either . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	803	His argument was that the decision by his former employer not to reinstate him when ordered to do so by the Employment Tribunal under what is now section 113 -LRB- a -RRB- of the Employment Rights Act 1996 was a refusal or a deliberate omission to offer him that employment within the meaning of section 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- of the 1976 Act .

254	850	Anti-Discrimination Legislation : 133 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	851	The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 broke new ground for English domestic law and adopted a fairly cautious approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	852	The criteria for discrimination and the scope of the Act 's application were fairly narrowly drawn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	853	It is not right to view it , which was the invitation of the appellants , as creating a comprehensive anti-discrimination scheme . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	854	The Race Relations Act of the following year was in the same mould but at the same time adopted a more generalised criterion of unlawful discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	855	The former Act had said : `` a person discriminates against a woman if on the grounds of her sex he treats her less favourably than he treats or would treat a man '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	856	The latter Act uses the phrases `` on racial grounds '' and `` other persons '' which do not depend upon the racial group to which the actual complainant personally belongs or the racial group to which the comparator belongs provided the relevant racial ground would not apply to him but is otherwise comparable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	857	For example , the relevance of race may be to the fact that the complainant is married to a person of a different race or has adopted children of a particular race . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	858	The drafting of the 1995 Act also shows signs of a developing confidence of those responsible for anti-discrimination legislation and refers to the `` reason '' for treating someone less favourably . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	859	The same developments are to be observed in other provisions of the three Acts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	860	In construing each of these Acts and assessing and understanding decisions made under one or other of them , it is necessary , if errors are not to be made , to have regard to the actual wording of the relevant Act as is illustrated by what I have said about the different criteria used in the 1975 and the 1976 Acts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	861	134 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
254	862	Another self-evident point is that the drafting of each Act had to be adapted to the type of discrimination at which it is directed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	863	Thus the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 inevitably has to relate to direct discrimination and include a defence of justification . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	864	It is coupled with qualified obligations to make special arrangements for those with disabilities , including , in limited circumstances , adapting buildings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	865	Similarly , each Act makes specific but different provision for its scope of application and those it will affect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	866	But each Act also has a similar structure and , as between the 1975 and 1976 Acts , some provisions are expressed in the same or very similar words . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	867	This is particularly so in relation to the 'em ployment field ' provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	868	I agree that these statutes should be read as contributions to a developing scheme of anti-discrimination law and such words should not without good reason be given a different reading as between one of the statutes and another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	869	They are not statutes to be formally ` read with ' each other but they are statutes which reflect a consistent -LRB- though developing -RRB- legislative policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	870	The wording of the 'em ployment field ' provision in the 1975 and 1976 Acts is in a relevant respect slightly different from the 1995 Act which , instead of using the phrase `` employed by him '' , uses the phrase `` whom he employs '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	871	None of the counsel in these appeals submitted that a distinction should be made between the Acts on this ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	872	I consider that they were right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	873	I will accordingly use the 1975 Act as the reference point save where it is necessary to refer to the Acts separately . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	874	135 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	875	The structure of the relevant parts of each of the Acts is also similar . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	876	They start with a definition of the relevant test of discriminatory conduct : Part I in the 1975 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	877	They continue by defining -LRB- with elaborations or qualifications -RRB- the ` fields ' in which the Act is to apply : Parts II and III of the 1975 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	878	They then add provisions making some related acts unlawful and granting some general exceptions to the application of the ` fields ' : Parts IV and V of the 1975 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	879	The words directly involved in the Adekeye point are in the Part defining the 'em ployment field ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	880	All these cases were said to arise in the employment field , which in all three Acts is the primary field of application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	881	The victimisation point arises from provisions which in the 1975 and 1976 Acts appear in the Part defining discriminatory conduct but which , in the 1995 Act , are placed in the later Part which -LRB- inter alia -RRB- makes other related acts unlawful -LRB- Part VII -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	882	In all three Acts the actual wording of the victimisation provision is similar and is by way of extending the definition of ` discrimination ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	883	In relation to sex discrimination , what is involved in victimisation has been the subject of a decision of the European Court of Justice in the case of Coote -LRB- case C-185 / 97 -RRB- applied by Morison J in Coote No. 2 -LSB- 1999 -RSB- ICR 942 , to which I will revert later . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	884	Adekeye : 136 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	885	Adekeye was an employment field case under the 1976 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	886	It was therefore essential for the complainant to show that the Employment Tribunal had jurisdiction under Part II of the 1976 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	887	Her complaint was that she had been summarily dismissed by her employers , the Post Office , on racial grounds and that , on the same grounds , she had again been discriminated against when she had appealed against her dismissal under the Post Office 's internal appeal procedure and her appeal had been dismissed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	888	Her complaint against her dismissal was out of time but her complaint relating to her appeal was not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	889	The Court of Appeal referring to the wording of s. 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1976 Act formulated the question to be answered as being : Could a person who had been dismissed still be described as `` a person employed by '' the person who had already dismissed him ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	890	They adopted a simple temporal test : did the relevant act come before or after the termination of the employment ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	891	The Court of Appeal , following an earlier decision by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in Nagarajan v Agnew -LSB- 1995 -RSB- ICR 520 , concluded that being employed and being dismissed were mutually inconsistent states . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	892	The Court of Appeal accordingly held that the Employment Tribunal had no jurisdiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	893	It was this decision by which the courts below were bound and which caused them to decline to entertain the appellants ' various applications . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	894	137 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	895	Was Adekeye right ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	896	As a matter of the simple language of s. 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and its equivalent in the 1975 and 1995 Acts , there is much to be said for it and it provides a rule of simple application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	897	But a different view is possible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	898	The words are not used to refer to a status but to a connection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	899	Under the Acts the discriminatory treatment does not have to be an infringement of the complainant 's contractual rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	900	It can simply be less favourable treatment than that afforded to others in a like position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	901	To introduce at this point into the structure of the Acts a criterion of strict contractual status would be anomalous having regard to their scheme as a whole . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	902	There is the further recommendation for the connection approach that it avoids some of the individual anomalies as illustrated by the facts of Adekeye itself and referred to in the judgment in that case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	903	Why distinguish between the discriminatory dismissal and the discriminatory conduct during the internal appeal against that dismissal ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	904	Indeed , the complainant may have a contractual right to invoke the appeal procedure and to a fair consideration of his or her appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	905	The remedy for which the complainant may be asking in that appeal procedure is the revocation of the dismissal decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	906	To construe the Act so that the dismissal can be the subject of a discrimination complaint but the handling of the appeal can not is irrational and unnecessary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	907	The scheme of the Acts and the context in which the relevant words occur suggest that , rather than importing a crude temporal test , they describe the substantive scope within which the various duties not to discriminate under the Acts apply in the employment field . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	908	138 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	909	But that still leaves a problem . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	910	The purpose of the relevant Part of these Acts is to define the scope of their operation -LRB- and consequentially , in relation to the 'em ployment field ' , the jurisdiction of Employment , formerly Industrial , Tribunals -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	911	One therefore needs , before one can properly discard the Adekeye interpretation , to see whether the alternative interpretation has a sufficient degree of clarity to be a fair reading of the words used and to perform the defining function of these words in the Acts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	912	In the 1975 Act , the relevant words `` woman employed by him '' only appear in s. 6 of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	913	Subsection 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- does not use such words since it deals with those seeking employment ; it uses the words `` in relation to employment by him '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	914	In subsection 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- where the words are used , no problem need arise under paragraph -LRB- a -RRB- since the wording of that paragraph read as a whole clearly refers to things happening during the currency of the woman 's employment by the discriminator ; -LRB- a -RRB- is self limiting and therefore does not raise the question presently under consideration nor does it need a restricted meaning to be given to the introductory phrase . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	915	It is in paragraph -LRB- b -RRB- that the question manifests itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	916	-LRB- b -RRB- includes two elements : first , `` by dismissing her '' ; secondly , by `` subjecting her to any other detriment '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	917	The first should be read as referring to the whole of the process of dismissal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	918	So , if the internal procedures of the employer or the legitimate expectations of the employee -LRB- or indeed the avoidance of an ` unfair ' dismissal -RRB- include a review of the dismissal decision , whether by appeal or otherwise , -LRB- b -RRB- should be read as including that review within its scope and any discrimination on grounds of the sex of the employee will be contrary to the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	919	-LRB- I have used the word 'em ployee ' in this sentence deliberately to demonstrate that it is a perfectly natural use of language to refer to the woman in this situation in that way . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	920	Thus the content of the first part of -LRB- b -RRB- suffices to guide the giving of a non-legalistic meaning to the earlier phrase `` employed by him '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	921	In my judgment a similar approach should be adopted in relation to the second part of -LRB- b -RRB- - `` or subjecting her to any other detriment '' , a phrase which can include the denial of a benefit and ties in with the phrase `` treats her less favourably '' in s. 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	922	139 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	923	The words `` subjecting her to any other detriment '' are general and undefined but it can be seen that the problem of construction is to decide what breadth they should be given and whether , on the facts of any given case , the facts fall within them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	924	Guidance upon the scope can again be derived from the content of the provision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	925	What are the detriments which an employer may subject an employee to which can fairly be referred to as `` any other detriment '' in the context of this subsection ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	926	The answer must lie in a test of proximity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	927	Does the conduct complained about have a sufficiently close connection with her employment ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	928	Is it sufficiently similar to the other conduct mentioned in the subsection ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	929	Any criterion of proximity has as its antithesis the concept of remoteness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	930	Remoteness can have , as an element , remoteness in time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	931	The further removed the conduct is in time from the employment , the greater the likelihood that the conduct is too remote and that the employment has become merely a matter of history . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	932	This is not a resurrection of the Adekeye test ; it involves no cut-off point but is simply a recognition that , as time passes , it may become more difficult to show that the conduct complained of had a sufficient connection with the employment and a sufficient similarity with the other conduct falling within subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	933	Thus it is relevant to ask whether the conduct complained of , if committed whilst she had still been currently employed by the person complained about , would have come within s. 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- ; but she will also have to show that other former employees would , in the same circumstances , not have been subjected to the detriment - would have enjoyed the benefit denied to her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	934	140 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	935	I appreciate that such an approach will ultimately lead to fact specific decisions in a number of cases but that is what is involved in the rejection of an arbitrary time-based criterion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	936	It should not lead to any additional uncertainty for employers since the construction which I prefer is based upon a factual connection with the employment which it should be easier for the lay employer to understand and apply than an essentially legal criterion depending upon identifying the moment when ` dismissal ' was complete . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	937	The nub is that the introductory words `` a woman employed by him '' are to be read with the rest of subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- and relate to a substantive and proximate connection between the conduct complained of and her employment by the alleged discriminator . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	938	141 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	939	In assessing whether the requisite connection exists , a starting point is to ask whether the same conduct during the currency of the employment would be unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	940	Likewise it is relevant whether or not a legitimate expectation of the benefit , or the contractual right to it , has continued and whether other former employees do in the same circumstances enjoy the benefit or suffer the detriment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	941	For example , if other employees are permitted to continue to enjoy the use of the employee 's social club after they have retired , but the complainant is not , that will come within the expression `` any other detriment '' and , if she has been discriminated against on grounds of her sex , she will be entitled to complain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	942	142 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	943	More difficult is the giving of references since it may refer to many different situations - the refusal of any reference at all , the giving of a limited reference , the giving of an unfavourable reference - and to many different complaints - breach of contract , breach of a legitimate expectation , breach of a duty of care , defamation , discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	944	Also the complainant may well be able to argue that , if the same reference had been refused or given during the currency of her employment , she would have been discriminated against but it of course does not necessarily follow that later conduct would also amount to discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	945	Something more has to be alleged and proved , that she had at the least a legitimate expectation of being given a reference at a later stage and in her then circumstances and that other ex-employees would in the same circumstances have been given one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	946	Likewise , if one has been given but she is complaining about what it does or does not say , she must allege and prove that others in the like circumstances would have received a favourable one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	947	In Spring v Guardian Assurance Plc -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 2 AC 296 , your Lordships ' House considered the extent and content of the obligation to give a reference . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	948	Lord Woolf referred at p. 354 to the fact that the position might not be the same once the employee had left his employment and there had been a lapse of time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	949	Discussing the contractual term which might be implied he used the phrase `` during the continuance of the engagement or within a reasonable time thereafter '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	950	The obligation will not necessarily be open-ended and the later it is asked for the less detail and information it may contain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	951	It must be an obligation which the employer recognises in respect of other ex-employees in the like circumstances , otherwise the complainant can not say she has been subjected to a detriment or denied a benefit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	952	If the conduct is to be the subject of a complaint under one or other of the anti-discrimination Acts , it must come within and satisfy the criteria of the relevant Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	953	This illustrates the link in practice between the questions of ` less favourable treatment ' , denying a ` benefit ' and subjecting to a ` detriment ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	954	I will have to revert to the question of references when I come to deal with the appeals in the cases which arose under the 1995 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	955	143 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	956	What I have said in the preceding paragraphs also reflects the view of the European Court of Justice in their decision in the case of Coote -LRB- C-185 / 97 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	957	The employee 's complaint was that she had been discriminated against on the grounds of her sex in that after leaving her employment she had applied to her former employer for a reference and had been refused one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	958	The back-ground to the dispute was that she had earlier , whilst still actually employed by him , complained about other conduct of her employer and her discrimination claim on that occasion had been settled . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	959	The case therefore had a victimisation element . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	960	The Industrial Tribunal had rejected her -LRB- second -RRB- claim under the 1975 Act on the ground that at the time she was refused a reference she was no longer employed by him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	961	However , since her case was also covered by the ` Equal Treatment Directive ' -LRB- 76/207/EEC -RRB- , the EAT sought an opinion from the ECJ whether that decision was consistent with the Directive 's requirement that member states provide effective remedies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	962	144 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	963	The Advocate-General , at paragraphs 14 to 16 emphatically rejected the Adekeye criterion : `` It would be totally unjustifiable for the application of the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of sex to a decision on the provision or refusal of references to depend on the moment when that decision was taken ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	964	The court has , moreover , always held with regard to equal pay that the prohibition of discrimination by an employer between employees on grounds of sex does not cease to have effect on the termination of the contract of employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	965	... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	966	I therefore consider that an employer may not discriminate on grounds of sex when providing an employee with references , whatever the moment - whether during or after the period of the employment relationship - at which the decision is taken in that regard or at which those references are requested . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	967	145 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	968	The ECJ in its judgment , after noting the element of victimisation , summarised its ruling upon the question referred in paragraph 28 : `` In those circumstances the answer to the questions put by the national court must be that article 6 of the Directive requires member states to introduce into their national legal systems such measures as are necessary to ensure judicial protection for workers whose employer , after the employment relationship has ended , refuses to provide references ... '' It would be possible to read this judgment as limiting the ruling to cases of victimisation but in my view that would not do justice to the reasoning which is more comprehensive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	969	Nor would it pay adequate regard to the clear views expressed by the Advocate-General . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	970	146 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	971	On the return of the case to the EAT , -LSB- 1999 -RSB- ICR 942 , the Appeal Tribunal recognised that the main issue which they had to consider was `` whether it is possible to construe the Act of 1975 so as to enable a complainant to make a victimisation complaint in relation to events that occurred after the employment relationship had terminated '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	972	The judgment of Appeal Tribunal given by Morison J , carefully reviewed the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in Adekeye and concluded that it could no longer be followed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	973	Victimisation cases may be a fortiori but within the scheme of these Acts all cases have to pass through the gateway of one of the ` fields ' of application and therefore it is still , in an 'em ployment field ' case , necessary to consider the `` employed by '' question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	974	I consider that Morison J was right and that Adekeye is no longer good law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	975	Victimisation : 147 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	976	What I have said in the preceding paragraphs is also largely dispositive of the treatment of victimisation cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	977	Victimisation is in principle a free-standing unlawful wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	978	It is ancillary to the main provisions of the relevant Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	979	It is not dependant upon the primary criterion of discrimination - sex , race , disability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	980	The criteria are different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	981	For example , to use the wording of s. 4 of the 1975 Act , the victimisation arises from the complainant having made a sex discrimination complaint against the discriminator or any other person or having assisted another to do so or having given evidence in support of that other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	982	The section has even been amended to bring in other Acts and extends to suspected conduct of the victim either past or future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	983	These criteria go far beyond anything specific to any employment relationship between the victim and the alleged discriminator and are in themselves gender -LRB- or race or disability -RRB- neutral . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	984	There is a saving in each of the Acts to exclude ` victims ' who have made false allegations or acted in bad faith . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	985	148 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	986	However it is still necessary for the person making a victimisation complainant to show that the discriminator has treated the person victimised `` less favourably than in those circumstances he treats or would treat other persons '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	987	This brings one back to the ` field ' provisions and , in the 1975 Act , to s. 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	988	The less favourable treatment has to come within one part or another of s. 2 and , if it is upon s. 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- that the complainant relies , the complainant must show the requisite connection between the less favourable treatment complained of and her employment , whether it be prospective , future , current or past , by the alleged discriminator . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	989	Again the decision of the ECJ is compelling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	990	The Acts must be construed so as not to amount to the denial of a remedy for victimisation and , in particular , not so as to apply an arbitrary temporal test . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	991	Once it can be shown that it is a detriment - a disadvantage - to which the employer does not subject others and it can fairly , in the context of s. 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , be termed any other detriment , the victimised complainant will have proved what is required in this respect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	992	It is certainly not disproved by the mere fact that the complainant is no longer employed by the discriminator . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN

254	994	Victimisation is an a fortiori case which shows that the application of the Adekeye approach is unacceptable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	995	But essentially the same construction of the provisions defining the 'em ployment field ' is to be adopted in victimisation cases and in ordinary discrimination cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	996	The case must still come substantively within the provisions defining the ` field ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	997	The Jurisdiction Question : 150 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	998	In any 'em ployment field ' case there is potentially a jurisdiction question for the Employment Tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	999	Section 63 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1975 Act -LRB- as amended -RRB- provides : '' A complaint by any person -LRB- ` the complainant ' -RRB- that another person -LRB- ` the respondent ' -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- has committed an act of discrimination against the complainant which is unlawful by virtue of Part II ... . may be presented to an employment tribunal . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	1000	There are provisions to the like effect in s. 54 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1976 Act and s. 8 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1995 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	1001	The Tribunals are bodies with limited jurisdiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	1002	Section 2 of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996 empowers them to exercise the jurisdiction given to them by -LRB- inter alia -RRB- these Acts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	1003	It follows that if the complaint does not fall within the 'em ployment field ' as defined in the relevant Act , the Employment Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to entertain the complaint and must decline to do so , as did the Tribunal in Adekeye . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	1004	151 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	1005	To categorise any question as going to jurisdiction raises procedural problems for the Tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	1006	At what stage of the proceedings should the Tribunal decide the question ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	1007	Does the actual question go to jurisdiction ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	1008	Under Adekeye this did not raise any real difficulty for the Tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	1009	The complainant had to say when the act complained of had occurred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	1010	The time based criteria -LRB- the time bar and the date of dismissal -RRB- could then be mechanically applied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	1011	But if , as is my opinion , a substantive criterion has to be applied , more may need to be known and some investigation may have to take place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	1012	There seems to be no escape from the conclusion that the whole of the 'em ployment field ' provision -LRB- in the 1975 Act , s. 2 -RRB- is relevant to jurisdiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	1013	The complainant must prove - satisfy the Tribunal - that his or her complaint comes within the relevant section . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	1014	If the complainant fails to do so , then the claim must fail both substantively and as a matter of jurisdiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	1015	This would then preclude any consideration whether or not there was any discrimination contrary to the primary provisions of the relevant Act or any victimisation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	1016	152 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	1017	But this tidy dichotomy will rarely exist in practice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
254	1018	The question whether the complainant was subjected to some `` other detriment '' overlaps with -LRB- but is not the same as -RRB- the question whether the claimant was treated `` less favourably '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1019	The Tribunal will often find itself in practice in the same position when deciding an issue concerning less favourable treatment as it now does when it has to decide a dispute which turns upon the provisions which define the 'em ployment field ' and will find it advantageous to make use of the same procedures to simplify hearings and separate off those claims which can have no proper basis and those allegations which appear to have no substance in fact . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1020	As the cases demonstrate , the Tribunal is competent to decide whether it has jurisdiction and any such decision can be the subject of an appeal to the Appeal Tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1021	The Individual Cases : 153 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1022	In all the cases under appeal the courts below had treated themselves as bound by Adekeye . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1023	They accordingly decided them against the present appellants on jurisdictional grounds -LRB- and/or time bar -RRB- without considering or investigating the merits of the appellants ' claims . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1024	I have given my opinion that Adekeye is not good law ; it follows that all the appeals should be allowed and remitted for further hearing unless there is some other factor which justifies not taking that course . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1025	Rhys-Harper 154 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1026	The whole of her complaint involved allegations of less favourable treatment which fell within the ambit of the 'em ployment field ' as being either part of the dismissal process itself or part of the internal review of her dismissal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1027	Her primary problem was that she had not made any claim in the Employment Tribunal until 18th February 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1028	The cut-off date for her was therefore 19th November 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1029	She had been dismissed at a disciplinary hearing held on 10th October . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1030	She had exercised her right of internal appeal and the hearing was on 9th November . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1031	Originally her complaints were confined solely to her being dismissed on the ground of what had occurred on 6th October -LRB- the date of the incident involving guests at the swimming pool for which she was being disciplined -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1032	However when giving evidence at the hearing of her internal appeal , which was conducted by the Respondents ' general manager , Mr Adamson , she stated that she been subjected to sexual harassment at an earlier stage of her employment and referred also to other earlier acts of sexual discrimination at earlier dates which she had not complained about at the time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1033	Mr Adamson asked her to give him a written statement concerning the earlier incidents so that he could investigate them himself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1034	-LRB- The written statement has not been put in evidence in the present proceedings . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1035	She later told the Employment Tribunal that `` it was investigated badly . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1036	155 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1037	On 30th November Mr Adamson sent Miss Rhys-Harper two separate letters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1038	One , headed `` Re Appeal Hearing '' consisted of one sentence : `` Following your appeal against your dismissal , having investigated the events the company has found there was sufficient grounds to dismiss and therefore the decision stands . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1039	The other headed `` Re Allegation of sexual harassment against Ken Osborn '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1040	In it Mr Adamson referred to the allegation of sexual harassment she had made against Mr Osborn , informed her that a full and thorough investigation had been made into the alleged incident -LRB- which she had said had occurred at an earlier date when she had gone into the mens ' showers and no one else had been present -RRB- , that staff had been interviewed , including Mr Osborn , that it was confirmed that she had reported the incident but had asked for the information to remain private , that other staff had been unable to substantiate or witness the alleged harassment and that accordingly the company had concluded that there was `` insufficient evidence to establish a case against Mr Osborn '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1041	He ended his letter by stressing that the company did not condone harassment or victimisation and any member of staff found guilty of any form of harassment would be dealt with in accordance with company policy and disciplinary procedures , adding that if additional evidence should become available a further investigation would be held . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1042	156 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1043	In her application to the Employment Tribunal , she confined her complaint to sexual harassment and -LRB- it seems -RRB- constructive dismissal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1044	Her particulars of her complaint only referred to alleged incidents of sexual harassment and bullying occurring over a period January 1998 to October 1998 and to the incident which occurred on 6th October 1998 and had led to her dismissal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1045	She alleged that the investigation of the 6th October incident and her complaints about Mr Osborn had not been investigated properly by the company prior to dismissing her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1046	The Employment Tribunal considered that time could be treated as running from 30th November and that her claims were accordingly in time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1047	Before the Tribunal she had appeared in person and the company had been unrepresented and had merely made a short written submission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1048	157 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1049	Before the Appeal Tribunal both sides were represented , the company by an employee and Miss Rhys-Harper by counsel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1050	Her counsel put her case solely on the basis of sexual discrimination submitting that `` the act complained of '' was `` the act of failure to investigate properly and dismissing her complaint '' -LRB- sic -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1051	But it was not part of her case that she had asked Mr Adamson for an investigation , nor has she alleged that in that investigation she was treated unfavourably on the grounds of her sex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1052	The Appeal Tribunal were nevertheless prepared to treat this complaint as referring to a continuing breach still existing on 30th November but they rejected the claim on the basis of Adekeye . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1053	If the Appeal Tribunal was not correct in its conclusion about the time bar point , the claim would have failed anyway ; the Adekeye point would be academic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1054	158 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1055	Your Lordships consider that the case should be remitted to enable the further consideration of her claim unfettered by the decision in Adekeye . 	lord hobhouse	all	partagr	0.7	NAN
254	1056	For myself , I have considerable doubts whether this is an appropriate order to make . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1057	There seems to have been a mistaken assumption that under the 1975 Act there was an entitlement to make a free-standing complaint of sexual harassment and to overlook the necessity for establishing a breach within the criteria stated in s. 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Act and satisfying the substantive requirements of s. 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- which I have endeavoured to explain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1058	The fact that Adekeye was wrong does not mean that s. 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- is not still relevant to the admissibility of the claim now being put forward . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1059	Nor does it mean that the 3 month time limit can be forgotten about or that it is unnecessary to do justice as between both parties and to consider whether she had ever made the complaint now relied on prior to its being introduced during the hearing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1060	Since the decision of the House is that the case should be remitted , I trust to a freshly constituted Tribunal which will reconsider the whole matter , I will say no more about these points as they will now have to be subject of a decision of an Employment Tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1061	If her present complaint was time barred at the time she first made it , it remains time barred now . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1062	D'Souza : 159 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1063	This case too has complexities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1064	In 1992 , the appellant had made claims of unfair dismissal , race discrimination and victimisation which were upheld by the Employment Tribunal which ordered that he be reinstated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1065	In March the following year the Borough informed him that he would not be reinstated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1066	On 1st July 1995 , the appellant made a complaint of further discrimination and victimisation in respect of the failure of the Borough to reinstate him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1067	On 10th July 1995 , the Tribunal found that it had not been reasonably practical to reinstate him and made an appropriate award of compensation taking into account the failure to reinstate him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1068	The Tribunal communicated its decisions to the parties on 10th and 14th August . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1069	Meanwhile , on 31st July , the appellant had lodged a further application to the Tribunal effectively duplicating that of 1st July alleging that the refusal to reinstate was race discrimination and victimisation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1070	It was this application which came before the Tribunal on 23rd February 1996 and was dismissed on the basis of Adekeye . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1071	160 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1072	The problem for the appellant is that his essential complaint remains that he was not reinstated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1073	It is this act which he alleges amounted to discrimination and victimisation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1074	But he has already , pursuant to the earlier decision of the Employment Tribunal , been compensated by the Borough for the failure to reinstate and there is nothing further which can form the basis of a claim for compensation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1075	I therefore agree with your Lordships that the appeal in this case ought to be dismissed . 	lord hobhouse	all	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1076	The 1995 Act cases : 161 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1077	These four cases also raise some problems . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1078	Two of them are concerned with the content of references : Kirker and Angel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1079	A third , Bond , concerns an answer given to a mortgage insurance company . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1080	The fourth , Jones , is different and relates to the refusal to return property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1081	They all lie close to the limits of what comes within the boundaries of the 'em ployment field ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1082	Three of them raise arguable cases of victimisation - Kirker , Jones and Angel - and are thus capable of satisfying the discrimination requirement but still need to satisfy the 'em ployment field ' requirement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1083	162 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1084	Jones is perhaps the simplest case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1085	Mr Jones complains of the refusal to allow him to have back business cards , his personal property , which were left behind at his workplace when he was dismissed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1086	The connection with his employment is clear and not affected by the delay which occurred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1087	I would therefore allow the appeal and order a remission . 	lord hobhouse	self	outcome	0.7	NAN
254	1088	163 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1089	Kirker and Angel are , as I have said reference cases but of a particular kind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1090	They relate to delayed applications for references which were not responded to as favourably as the appellant would have wished . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1091	Mr Kirker complains that his employers declined to answer the question whether they would have re-employed him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1092	The person answering a reference is under a duty to the person making the inquiry to give an honest and truthful answer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1093	If the truth is that the referee would not have re-employed the relevant person , the referee must say so even though it may be fatal to that person 's job application to the person making the inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1094	The same considerations apply to the complaint of Mrs Angel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1095	If the case of either of them is that the former employer should have given a reference which it did not believe to be factually correct and accurate , the complainant will have to be prepared to allege and prove that the former employer would have given other ex-employees references which it knew were inaccurate or incorrect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1096	This is a difficult case for any complainant to make credibly and , if they can not , they have no credible case that they have been treated less favourably . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1097	Since the answers to this question depends upon facts not in your Lordships ' possession on the hearing of these appeals I would therefore allow the appeals and order remission as in the case of Rhys-Harper . 	lord hobhouse	self	outcome	0.7	NAN
254	1098	164 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1099	Finally in the case of Mrs Bond . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1100	Her case has a longer history behind it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1101	Her complaints centre on two points . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1102	One is that Hackney CAB declined to supply her with references in accordance with a draft which she herself had prepared . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1103	The other is that they declined to state to her mortgage insurance company that she had been made compulsorily redundant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1104	It was the Bureau 's understanding that she had agreed to voluntary redundancy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1105	Following the same logic , I would allow her appeal and order a remission so that the whole matter can be considered afresh . 	lord hobhouse	self	outcome	0.7	NAN
254	1106	Conclusions : 165 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1107	For these reasons , which substantially accord with those of my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls , I would allow the appeals in all the cases except D'Souza and make orders accordingly for remission to an Employment Tribunal : I would dismiss the appeal in D'Souza . 	lord hobhouse	lord nicholls	fullagr	0.7	NAN

254	1125	In the course of the appeal hearing , on 9 November 1998 , the appellant complained that prior to the events that were the occasion of her dismissal she had been the victim of sexual harassment by Mr Osborn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1126	It is , in my opinion , a fair inference that her complaint about sexual harassment by Mr Osborn was not a free-standing complaint separate from her appeal against dismissal but was put forward as a reason for impugning Mr Osborn 's dismissal decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1127	168 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1128	On 30 November 1998 the appellant received two letters from Mr Adamson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1129	One letter told her that her appeal against dismissal had failed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN

254	1140	In the course of their extended reasons the tribunal described the appellant 's complaint as being `` for a series of incidents of sex discrimination which lasted until early October 1998 '' but took the view that Mr Adamson 's 30 November 1998 decision `` could be in itself a continuing discrimination against her '' -LRB- para 8 -RRB- .

254	1145	If her sexual discrimination claim was to be viable then , unless she were given an extension of time , she would need to rely on an act of discrimination occurring after 19 November 1998 , ie . after the termination of her employment on 22 October 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1146	172 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1147	Accordingly , both in the EAT and in the Court of Appeal the appellant 's claim was presented as including a complaint about an act of discrimination consisting of failure by Mr Adamson to investigate properly her complaint of sexual harassment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1148	The EAT posed the question whether she had `` a free-standing claim ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1149	in relation to matters after 19 November 1998 even though she had ceased to be an employee '' -LRB- para 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1150	In the Court of Appeal Pill LJ described her complaint as a `` complaint about sexual harassment '' -- which is what it had originally been -- but Buxton LJ described it as `` solely a failure ... . properly to investigate her complaint '' -- which is what it had had to become . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1151	173 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1152	The EAT held that since the alleged discriminatory conduct had taken place after the appellant 's employment had come to an end , her complaint could not be brought within the 1975 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1153	Her appeal on this point was dismissed by the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN

254	1155	174 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1156	In summary , the alleged discriminatory conduct was committed by Relaxion , through Mr Adamson , after the appellant 's employment had come to an end . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1157	The conduct in question was Mr Adamson 's alleged failure to deal properly with the sexual harassment complaint made to him as part of the appellant 's case that her dismissal by Mr Osborn ought not to be allowed to stand . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1158	In failing to deal properly with the complaint Mr Adamson , it is said , discriminated against her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1159	D'Souza v Lambeth BC 175 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1160	In this case the alleged discrimination consisted of the Council 's failure to re-instate the appellant in the job from which he had been dismissed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1161	He was dismissed in January 1990 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1162	Following his dismissal he made an application to the Employment Tribunal complaining of unfair dismissal , race discrimination and victimization . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1163	His application was successful on all three grounds and on 16 November 1992 the Tribunal made an order that the Council re-instate him by 16 January 1993 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1164	The Council did not re-instate him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1165	In July 1995 the appellant instituted a fresh application against the Council complaining of racial discrimination and victimization in respect of the Council 's failure to re-instate him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1166	The Council contended that the post the appellant had previously occupied no longer existed and that it was not practicable for them to re-instate him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1167	The Tribunal accepted these contentions and , by a Decision of 18 October 1995 , made an award of compensation in the appellant 's favour in respect of his original complaint of unfair dismissal , having regard to the fact that he had not been re-instated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1168	In effect this Decision replaced the original order for re-instatement with an award of compensation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1169	176 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1170	On 14 March 1996 the Tribunal held it had no jurisdiction under the 1976 Act to hear the appellant 's complaint of race discrimination in respect of the Council 's refusal to re-instate him because the discriminatory conduct in question took place at a time when the appellant was no longer an employee of the Council . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1171	The EAT and the Court of Appeal agreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN

254	1173	177 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1174	In the D'Souza case the important context in which the point arises is not simply that the discriminatory conduct complained of was post-employment but is also that the complaint relates to the statutory remedies for unlawful discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
254	1175	It was the Employment Protection -LRB- Consolidation -RRB- Act 1978 , now replaced by the Employment Rights Act 1996 , that provided re-instatement as a possible remedy -LRB- see s. 113 of the 1996 Act ; it was the same Act that enabled the employer to seek a determination that re-instatement was not reasonably practicable -LRB- see s. 116 -LRB- 5 -RRB- and -LRB- 6 -RRB- and s. 117 -LRB- 7 -RRB- of the 1996 Act -RRB- ; it was the same Act which enabled an award of compensation to be made if an order for re-instatement was not complied with -LRB- see s. 117 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1996 Act -RRB- .

254	1177	There are four cases , in each of which the appellant suffers from a disability and alleges that he has suffered discrimination from an ex-employer on account of the disability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1178	In each , a claim was made under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1179	Kirker v British Sugar plc concerns references . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1180	The appellant was dismissed by British Sugar in March 1997 and successfully claimed that his dismissal involved discrimination on account of his disability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1181	In August 1999 he applied for a position with another company and named British Sugar as a previous employer who could give a reference about him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1182	British Sugar were asked by the prospective employer to supply the reference . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1183	They say they did so , but that is in dispute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1184	The appellant 's job application failed and he commenced proceedings both against the prospective employer and against British Sugar . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1185	The claim against British Sugar alleges discrimination and victimization in failing to supply the reference . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1186	The question arises whether , even if the appellant 's claim is factually correct , the discrimination is covered by the 1995 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1187	He was an ex-employee seeking a reference from an ex-employer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

254	1189	In Jones v 3M Healthcare Ltd the appellant was dismissed and brought unfair dismissal and disability discrimination proceedings against his ex-employers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1190	The proceedings were unsuccessful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1191	The appellant then asked his ex-employers to return to him some business cards which he had left in his erstwhile office and , on their failure to do so , successfully sued in the County Court for the return of the cards . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1192	He then commenced proceedings under the 1995 Act alleging that his ex-employers ' failure to return his cards was because he had instituted the discrimination proceedings and was accordingly victimization . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1193	But at the time of the allegedly victimizing conduct , the appellant was no longer an employee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1194	Is the discrimination covered by the 1995 Act ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

254	1196	Angel v New Possibilities NHS Trust is another reference case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1197	The appellant was dismissed from her employment with the NHS Trust in July 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

254	1205	Finally , there is Bond v Hackney Citizens ' Advice Bureau . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1206	The appellant had been employed by the CAB but in 1994 had been made redundant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1207	In November 1999 she made an application to an employment tribunal alleging that she had been discriminated against by the CAB on account of her disability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1208	And in June 2000 she made a further application alleging that the CAB had victimized her by declining to give a reference about her and also by the manner in which they had responded to enquiries made about her in connection with her mortgage re-payments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1209	The conduct complained of took place after her employment by the CAB had come to an end . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

254	1211	In each of these appeals the Employment Tribunal took the view that the complaints were not covered by the 1995 Act for the reason that the discriminatory conduct complained of had taken place after the employment had come to an end . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1212	The EAT and the Court of Appeal agreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1213	The point is now before your Lordships . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1214	The scope of the anti-discrimination legislation 183 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1215	It is clear that each of the anti-discrimination statutes , that is to say , the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 , the Race Relations Act 1976 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 , covers discrimination against applicants for jobs and discrimination against current employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1216	The issue is whether or to what extent the Acts cover discrimination against ex-employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1217	There are three particular types of case in which alleged discrimination against ex-employees has led to litigation and to consideration being given to the issue by the Courts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1218	They are , first , cases in which the alleged discrimination has taken place in the course of domestic appeal procedures ; second , cases in which an ex-employee has sought a reference from his or her ex-employer ; and , third , cases in which some benefit has been extended by the ex-employer to some but not all ex-employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1219	There may , of course , be cases which do not fall into any of these categories . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1220	Jones v 3M Healthcare and the ex-employer 's retention of his business cards is one such case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1221	184 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1222	The issue is essentially one of statutory construction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1223	The language used in each of the three Acts suggests , if read literally , that ex-employees are not protected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1224	The 1975 Act refers to `` a woman employed by ... . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1225	the discriminator -LRB- s. 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1226	The 1976 Act refers to `` a person employed by ... . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1227	the discriminator -LRB- s. 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1228	The 1995 Act refers to `` a disabled person whom -LSB- the discriminator -RSB- employs ... . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1229	-LRB- s. 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1230	This language is indicative of a present relationship rather than a past one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1231	My noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead has , in paragraphs 44 to 48 of his opinion , referred to a number of textual provisions in the 1975 and 1976 Acts that reinforce the indication of a present relationship . 	lord scott	lord hope	partagr	0.8	NAN
254	1232	And , as he points out -LRB- paras 49 and 50 -RRB- , the indication of a present relationship is further reinforced by the language used in the 1995 Act . 	lord scott	lord hope	partagr	0.8	NAN
254	1233	185 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1234	The conclusion that ex-employees are not protected under these three Acts is consistent with domestic authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1235	In Nagarajan v Agnew ICR 520 Knox J held that there had to be a `` subsisting employment relationship '' for a claim under s. 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1976 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1236	The Court of Appeal in Post Office v Adekeye -LSB- 1947 -RSB- ICR 110 came to the same conclusion on the point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1237	Peter Gibson LJ said , at p 118 , that : '' ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1238	giving the words ` in the case of a person employed by him ' their ordinary and natural meaning in their context , those words mean , and can only mean , ` in the case of a person who is employed by him ' . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1239	186 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1240	This conclusion has not , however , met with uniform satisfaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1241	In Adekeye itself Peter Gibson LJ and Pill LJ said that it was unsatisfactory that the 1976 Act did not give a remedy for discrimination in the handling of an appeal against dismissal by an ex-employee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1242	Morison J in the EAT has twice expressed dissatisfaction with Adekye -LRB- see Cooke v Granada -LRB- No. 2 -RRB- -LSB- 1999 -RSB- ICR 942 , 949-950 and D'Souza v Lambeth BC , unreported -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1243	187 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1244	It has been urged upon your Lordships to adopt a purposive approach to construction of the relevant language in the three Acts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1245	It must surely , it is said , have been the intention of the legislature to protect an ex-employee from discrimination , and a fortiori from victimization for having previously complained of discrimination , where the discriminatory acts complained of consist of the unfair handling of appeals against dismissal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1246	In these cases the appellant will , if the appeal succeeds , be re-instated as an employee as though he or she had never been dismissed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1247	How can Parliament have intended that an employer , in reaching a decision as to whether an employee 's dismissal should stand or should be set aside , should be free from the restraints on discrimination imposed by the Act ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1248	It seems to me that once the question is asked there can be only one answer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1249	Of course Parliament must have intended the Acts to apply to such cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1250	188 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1251	On the other hand , where references are concerned the answer to whether Parliament must have intended the Acts to apply seems to me by no means clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1252	A request for a reference is , in part , a request for an opinion about the individual in question and , in part , a request for a statement of known events concerning that individual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1253	An employer has no general contractual obligation to give a reference about an employee or an ex-employee but , as Lord Slynn of Hadley said in Spring v Guardian Assurance Plc -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 2 AC 295 , 335 : '' ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1254	in many cases an employee will stand no chance of getting another job , let alone a better job , unless he is given a reference . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1255	There is at least a moral obligation on the employer to give it . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1256	Lord Woolf went further and expressed the view , at p 354 , that in respect of some types of employment `` it is necessary to imply a term into the contract that the employer would , during the continuance of the engagement or within a reasonable time thereafter , provide a reference at the request of a prospective employer which was based on facts revealed after making ... reasonably careful enquiries ... . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1257	And Lord Goff of Chieveley commented , at p 319 `` The provision of ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1258	references is a service regularly provided by employers to their employees ; indeed references are part of the currency of the modern employment market . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1259	189 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1260	Their Lordships held in Spring v Guardian Assurance Plc that an employer , or ex-employer , would owe a duty not only to the prospective new employer but also to the subject of the reference to take reasonable care that the reference was fair and accurate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1261	190 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1262	Whether or not there is an implied contractual obligation on an employer , or ex-employer , to give a reference , as there may be in some cases , most employers would , I am sure , usually give a reference if asked to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1263	But some might be reluctant to do so , particularly if a long period had elapsed since the object of the reference had been an employee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1264	If the anti-discrimination Acts are held to extend generally to ex-employees as well as current employees , any refusal or failure to supply a reference when asked to do so , no matter what period of years might have elapsed , might attract a discrimination complaint . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1265	191 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1266	Employers would be in a particularly vulnerable position where the possibility of a victimization complaint were present . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1267	Suppose an employee has made one , or more than one , unsuccessful discrimination complaints during the currency of his employment with a particular employer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1268	He then leaves his employment and later asks for a reference in connection with an application for a job with some other employer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1269	Must the first employer inform the prospective employer of the history of discrimination complaints made by the ex-employee ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1270	If the first employer refrains from doing so , will he be in breach of his duty to the prospective employer ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1271	If he does inform the prospective employer of the fact that the discrimination complaints were made and of their outcome , would that be victimization ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1272	Perhaps not , but to include in the reference the details of the unsuccessful discrimination complaints would surely be damaging to the ex-employee 's job prospects . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1273	Could it not be represented as constituting less favourable treatment than would have been accorded to an ex-employee who had not made such complaints ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1274	Similar problems might , of course , arise in relation to requests for references made by current employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1275	192 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1276	The problems about references are demonstrated by some of the disability discrimination cases now before the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1277	In Kirker complaint is made of a failure by British Sugar to provide a reference . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1278	Was British Sugar under an obligation to provide a reference ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1279	Presumably not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1280	It may be that a reference was in fact provided . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1281	But the appellant did not succeed in getting the job applied for . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1282	Was that because the reference was unfavourable ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1283	If it was unfavourable was that because the appellant had successfully claimed to have been dismissed on account of his disability ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1284	193 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1285	Angel v New Possibilities NHS Trust raises similar questions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1286	Victimization by the supply of an unfavourable reference is the kernel of the complaint . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1287	And in Bond v Hackney CAB , too , victimization by an ex-employer in failing to supply a reference is the kernel of the complaint . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1288	194 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1289	It is one thing to allow the Acts to apply to references requested about current employees during the currency of the employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1290	It is quite another thing to allow them to apply without limit of time to all ex-employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1291	It is clear enough that Parliament did not have these problems in mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1292	Otherwise some provision would surely have been included in the Acts clarifying the position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1293	But that is not by itself a reason why the Acts , if their language allows it , should not be applied to these cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1294	The literal language of a statute ought not , however , to be extended so as to cover matters that Parliament did not have in mind unless it is clear from the statute properly construed that Parliament would have intended the extension . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1295	195 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1296	The same problems are associated with post employment benefits . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1297	If ex-employees are led to expect post-employment benefits , such as membership of sports clubs , concessionary travel benefits or the like , it is easy to conclude that , even if their expectation is not strictly contractual , their deprivation of these benefits in circumstances involving discrimination on sex , race or disability grounds should be covered by the relevant Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1298	If , however , no such expectation has been engendered and an employer decides to offer some extra-contractual benefit to employees and to extend the benefit to some but not all ex-employees , can the excluded ex-employees make a discrimination complaint ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1299	A person can decide on which strangers he will bestow his generosity and from whom he will withhold it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1300	Can he not exercise the same freedom to discriminate in relation to those who were in the past his employees but have become strangers ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1301	Why should the anti-discrimination Acts apply ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1302	The answer to these questions is not , in my opinion , apparent from the Acts themselves . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1303	196 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1304	So how is the line to be drawn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1305	How is the principle to be formulated that would enable ex-employers and ex-employees to judge whether the imposition of a particular detriment , alleged to be discriminatory , was or was not covered by the Act ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1306	One answer would be to construe the Acts simply as covering all ex-employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1307	The participle `` employed '' in the 1975 and 1976 Acts would be read as meaning `` has been or is employed '' , and the word `` employs '' in the 1995 Act would be read as meaning `` employs or has employed '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1308	An alternative answer would be to confine the relevant words to their strict literal meaning and exclude ex-employees from protection under the Acts in all circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1309	My Lords I would , for my part , reject both these extremes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1310	I would reject the first because it requires a purposive construction that can only be justified by attributing to Parliament an evident intention that , to my mind , is not in the least evident . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1311	I would reject the second because it introduces an arbitrary rigidity into the implementation of the Act that is unrealistic and can not have been intended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1312	197 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1313	In my opinion , the answer to the conundrum can be found by concentrating on the relationship between the employer and employee that is brought into existence when the latter enters the service of the former . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1314	The relationship is , of course , based on contract , express or implied , but does not necessarily come to an end , ipso facto , when the employment comes to an end . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1315	The internal appeal procedures that most employers , and all good ones , institute are a good example . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1316	Employees are entitled to avail themselves of these procedures . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1317	An employee who is dismissed and challenges the dismissal does not because he has been dismissed lose his right to appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1318	The relationship between employer and employee , or ex-employee as he may by reason of his dismissal have become , is still in existence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1319	The employee 's , or ex-employee 's entitlement is not simply an entitlement to lodge an appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1320	He or she is entitled also to a fair hearing that is not tainted by discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1321	An obligation to provide such a hearing lies on the employer , or ex-employer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1322	The relationship that is brought into existence when an employee enters an employer 's service is not , in my opinion , wholly terminated so long as the internal appeal procedure is on foot . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1323	And , in my opinion , the reference to a woman `` employed '' in the 1975 Act , to a person `` employed '' in the 1976 Act and to a person whom the alleged discriminator `` employs '' in the 1995 Act can and should be given a purposive construction so as to cover dismissed employees during the currency of an internal appeal process . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1324	198 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1325	If the opinion I have expressed in the preceding paragraphs is right , Adekeye was wrongly decided . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1326	The case was one in which the complainant was dismissed by the Post Office but utilized the Post Office 's internal appeal procedures to appeal against the dismissal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1327	Her appeal was dismissed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1328	She then instituted proceedings under the 1976 Act contending that the failure of her appeal was on account of racial discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1329	The EAT held that her complaint was not justiciable because at the time her appeal against dismissal was dealt with she was no longer an employee of the Post Office . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1330	The Court of Appeal agreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1331	199 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
254	1332	It is of interest that an argument to somewhat of the same effect as that which I have attempted in paragraph 32 was addressed to the Court of Appeal in the Adekeye case -LSB- 1997 -RSB- ICR 110 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1333	The argument is recorded by Peter Gibson LJ at p 118 . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1334	-LSB- counsel -RSB- argued that the internal appeal is an integral part of the dismissal process and that until the appeal was concluded adversely to the employee , that process continued ; the rejection of the applicant 's appeal was therefore to be treated as her dismissal at a time she was employed . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1335	Peter Gibson LJ characterised this as `` an impossible argument '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1336	He said that '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1337	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1338	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1339	the appeal procedures -LSB- do -RSB- not turn what was worded as an unconditional dismissal into a conditional one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1340	Further , to argue that the dismissal did not take effect until the conclusion of the appeal is contrary to the decision of this court in J Sainsbury Ltd v Savage -LSB- 1981 -RSB- ICR 1 -RRB- . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1341	I respectfully agree with Peter Gibson LJ 's cited remarks about the unconditional nature of a dismissal and its immediate effect in terminating the employment but the thought behind counsel 's argument was , in my opinion , valid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1342	The issue was whether the relationship between employer and employee , or ex-employee , during the currency of the appeal procedures was a relationship to which section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1976 Act applied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1343	It does not follow that because the dismissal was immediate and unconditional the Act could not apply to the relationship that would necessarily continue until the conclusion of the appeal procedures . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1344	In my opinion , for the reasons given the Act would continue to apply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1345	200 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1346	Where references or other post-employment benefits are concerned the question whether the anti-discrimination Acts apply should , in my opinion , similarly depend on whether the relationship between employer and employee brought into existence when the employee entered the employer 's service is still in existence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1347	For my part I find it difficult to construct circumstances , other than those arising out of internal appeal procedures , where the relationship would still continue notwithstanding the dismissal , or departure for other reasons , of the employee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1348	Lord Woolf in Spring v Guardian Assurance Plc -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 2 AC 295 suggested that employees in certain types of employment might have an implied contractual right to a reference , whether before or after their employment had come to an end . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1349	If there were such a case , the continuing responsibility of the ex-employer towards the ex-employee in regard to references might constitute a continuing relationship sufficient to justify the application of the anti-discrimination Acts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1350	Another possible scenario is that of an employee who has been dismissed but is not allowed to return to his office to remove his belongings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1351	Perhaps Jones v 3M Healthcare Ltd is such a case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1352	In my opinion every employee who is dismissed is entitled to expect to be given a reasonable opportunity , under supervision if necessary , to remove his or her belongings from the premises where he or she was employed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1353	The entitlement might be founded on implied contract or merely reasonable expectation but in either case I would regard the relationship between employer and employee as continuing for a reasonable period for that purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1354	A discriminatory refusal to allow the ex-employee to remove his or her belongings would not , in my opinion , fall outside the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1355	201 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1356	Special problems arise where the discrimination allegation is , or includes , an allegation of victimization . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1357	Victimization -LRB- s. 4 of the 1975 Act , s. 2 of the 1976 Act , and s. 55 of the 1995 Act -RRB- is not per se unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1358	It is a form of discrimination that becomes unlawful if it takes place in circumstances in which the Act declares it to be unlawful eg . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1359	in relation to an employed person by subjecting the person to any detriment -LRB- s. 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1975 Act -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1360	Victimization does not , therefore , extend the scope of protection against discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1361	It simply requires a different comparison to be made than that which has to be made for other forms of discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1362	If , for example , a reference is refused to an ex-employee as an act of victimization , the relevant Act is no more , and no less , applicable than it would have been if the discrimination had taken some other form . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1363	But where the victimization claim is brought under the 1975 Act , the position is complicated by the need to take account of European Community law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

254	1365	The Coote v Granada Hospitality Ltd -LSB- 1999 -RSB- ICR 100 litigation arose out of the following circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

254	1367	The proceedings were settled and Miss Coote left Granada 's employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1368	She then sought but failed to find employment elsewhere . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1369	She brought proceedings against Granada alleging that her failure was because , by way of reprisal for her previous sex discrimination claims , Granada had refused to supply a reference about her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1370	The EAT sought a ruling from the European Court of Justice as to whether Council Directive 76/207/EEC required member states to introduce measures to enable victimized persons in Miss Coote 's position to pursue a claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

254	1380	In my respectful opinion it had not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1381	There is no difference between the words used in the 1975 Act and those used in the 1976 Act with which Adekeye was concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

254	1383	Moreover , the Directive did not have direct effect in the domestic law of this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1384	It required , if its terms differed from domestic law , to be implemented in domestic law by primary or subordinate legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1385	I , of course , accept that domestic legislation intended to implement a Directive should , if possible , be construed in a manner consistent with the Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

254	1388	It may be that the Government believed that no implementation measure was necessary because the 1975 Act did all that was required to comply with the Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

254	1405	I would dismiss these appeals . 	lord scott	self	outcome	0.9	NAN
254	1406	-LRB- 4 -RRB- In Jones v 3M Healthcare Ltd the courts below dismissed the case on the ground that at the time the alleged act of discrimination took place the appellant was no longer a person whom 3M Healthcare Ltd `` employs '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1407	In my opinion , the appellant was entitled to a reasonable opportunity to remove his belongings , including his business cards , from the premises where he was previously employed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

254	1410	But he was dismissed in November 1997 , his proceedings for unfair dismissal and disability discrimination were dismissed in August 1998 and he did not request the return of his cards until September 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

254	1420	On one level these appeals raise a short point of construction of the words `` a woman employed by him '' in section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 -LRB- `` the 1975 Act '' -RRB- , `` a person employed by him '' in section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Race Relations Act 1976 -LRB- `` the 1976 Act '' -RRB- and `` a person whom he employs '' in section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 -LRB- `` the 1995 Act '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1421	In substance , however , the House has to decide whether , as the Court of Appeal have held , in terms of these anti-discrimination Acts it is quite lawful for employers to discriminate against their former employees in circumstances where it would be quite unlawful for them to discriminate against their current employees .

254	1424	As they show , allowing for the distinctive features of the 1995 Act , the objectives and , to a greater or lesser degree , the structure and terms of the three Acts are similar . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1425	Precisely because of that , it has come to be accepted that an interpretation of the wording of one Act will be a guide to the interpretation of the equivalent wording in another Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1426	Most notably , in Anyanwu v South Bank Student Union -LSB- 2001 -RSB- UKHL 14 ; -LSB- 2001 -RSB- ICR 391 , 393 , para 2 , Lord Bingham of Cornhill said : `` Since the 1976 Act is one of a trio of Acts -LRB- with the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 -RRB- which contain similar statutory provisions although directed to different forms of discrimination , it is legitimate if necessary to consider those Acts in resolving any issue of interpretation which may arise on this Act . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1427	True to that spirit , in the hearings before the House counsel referred indiscriminately to authorities on the interpretation of the provisions in all three Acts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1428	Nor did they suggest that any approach other than that indicated by Lord Bingham of Cornhill would be realistic or appropriate , even though , of course , the 1975 Act has to be interpreted in the light of the Equal Opportunities Directive 76/207/EEC , whereas there is at present no equivalent European dimension lying behind the other Acts .

254	1429	209 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1430	Discrimination can take a variety of forms but all involve treating the person concerned less favourably than others . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1431	The law does not attempt to outlaw every form of undesirable discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1432	In Great Britain it concentrates on discrimination on the ground of sex , race and disability and then only in certain circumstances , including the employment field . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1433	In Northern Ireland the Fair Employment and Treatment -LRB- NI -RRB- Order 1998 adds discrimination on grounds of religious belief and political opinion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1434	Before sex and race discrimination were made unlawful , employers would sometimes try to preserve the all-male or all-white character of their workforce by simply refusing to take on women or ethnic minority job applicants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1435	Similarly , employers might refuse to employ disabled people in order to avoid having to make even minor adjustments for them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1436	The three anti-discrimination Acts make such tactics unlawful : section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- of the 1975 Act and section 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- of both the 1976 and 1995 Acts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1437	Another form of discrimination was to offer to employ people but on less favourable terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1438	That is outlawed by paragraph -LRB- b -RRB- of the same subsections . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1439	Moreover , once the person is employed , the employer can not discriminate by actually affording him less favourable terms of employment : section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of both the 1976 and 1995 Acts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1440	In the case of sex discrimination the mechanism is different : section 1 of the Equal Pay Act 1970 implies an equality clause into all contracts of employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1441	Where these provisions are observed , they go a long way towards ensuring that everyone has access to employment and enjoys the same contractual rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1442	If the employer fails to comply with his obligations under the contract of employment , the employee concerned has the usual remedies for breach of the contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

254	1444	Ensuring that all employees in similar positions have the same contractual rights is only a start . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1445	Employment is just as much about opportunities as about rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1446	Not for nothing was the body which was set up under the 1975 Act called the Equal Opportunities Commission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1447	Employees do not have a contractual right to promotion , but they should have an opportunity to earn it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1448	Similarly , certain types of training , with the prospect of a better job , may only be available to employees selected by the employer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1449	The selection should be made fairly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1450	The employer may run a social or recreational club which employees can apply to join . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1451	Again everyone should have an equal opportunity to join if they want to . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1452	If an employer were free to discriminate in these areas , which do not involve contractual rights as such , then those affected would be marginalised and unable to achieve their full potential . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1453	So one important purpose of the anti-discrimination Acts is to prevent employers from exercising their freedom of choice in such matters so as to discriminate against employees on the ground of their sex , race or disability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1454	That is achieved by the provisions which lie at the heart of these appeals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1455	In the case of the 1975 Act the relevant provision is section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , but it is convenient to set out subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- also : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- It is unlawful for a person , in relation to employment by him at an establishment in Great Britain , to discriminate against a woman - -LRB- a -RRB- in the arrangements he makes for the purpose of determining who should be offered that employment ; or -LRB- b -RRB- in the terms on which he offers her that employment , or -LRB- c -RRB- by refusing or deliberately omitting to offer her employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1456	-LRB- 2 -RRB- It is unlawful for a person , in the case of a woman employed by him at an establishment in Great Britain , to discriminate against her - -LRB- a -RRB- in the way he affords her access to opportunities for promotion , transfer or training , or to any other benefits , facilities or services , or by refusing or deliberately omitting to afford her access to them ; or -LRB- b -RRB- by dismissing her , or subjecting her to any other detriment . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1457	As subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- shows , the anti-discrimination Acts are not really concerned with employees ' rights under their contracts of employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1458	So , for instance , where a contract of employment is tainted by illegality , an employee may none the less complain that her employer discriminated against her on the ground of her sex by dismissing her , since both the Equal Treatment Directive and the 1975 Act are designed to provide effective relief in respect of discriminatory conduct `` rather than relief which reflects any contractual entitlement which may or may not exist '' : Hall v Woolston Hall Leisure Ltd -LSB- 2001 -RSB- EWCA Civ 170 ; -LSB- 2001 -RSB- ICR 99 , 119F - G , para 67 per Mance LJ . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1459	As Peter Gibson LJ put it , at p 113B - C , para 46 : `` It is the sex discrimination that is the core of the complaint , the fact of employment and the dismissal being the particular factual circumstances which Parliament has prescribed for the sex discrimination complaint to be capable of being made . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1460	Mummery J had made the same point when , in giving the judgment of the EAT in Leighton v Michael -LSB- 1996 -RSB- IRLR 67 , 69 , para 29 , he said that the claim of sex discrimination `` does not involve enforcing , relying on or founding a claim on the contract of employment . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1461	Employees invoke the Acts not to enforce their contractual rights but to enforce their statutory rights not to suffer discrimination `` in the employment field '' , inter alia in respect of the opportunities to which the employer affords access . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1462	211 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1463	Therefore , although being employed is one of the keys which unlocks access to the rights and remedies conferred by the anti-discrimination Acts , to a considerable extent those Acts are actually concerned with discrimination in relation to the various kinds of opportunities that employees may enjoy in addition to any contractual rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1464	Of course , not even all contractual rights end on the termination of employment : an employee may still have both rights and obligations under the contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1465	Most obviously , an employee may have a right under his contract to be paid a pension or to continue to enjoy free medical insurance , while he may also be bound by a restrictive covenant in the contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1466	Not only an employee 's rights and obligations under the contract of employment can continue after the employment itself comes to an end : an employer may continue to afford his former employees opportunities to enjoy some of the additional non-contractual benefits , such as access to sports or other recreational and social facilities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1467	Since the anti-discrimination Acts are not tied to contractual rights and obligations , there is in principle no reason why the Acts should cease to have effect in respect of these continuing opportunities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1468	I therefore have difficulty in seeing why Parliament , however cautious its approach , would ever have intended that it should be lawful for an employer to discriminate against a former employee in these respects . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1469	The idea , for instance , that Parliament intended that , after the 1976 Act was in force , an employer should still be able to bar a black former employee from entering the employer 's social club while allowing white former employees to continue to enjoy the facility strikes me as untenable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1470	212 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1471	The same applies to the provision of references . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1472	In some cases the employee may have a contractual right , whether express or implied , to be supplied with a reference . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1473	But even where that is not so , since an employee or former employee will often stand little chance of getting a new job without a reference , an employer will recognise at least a moral duty to provide one : Spring v Guardian Assurance Plc -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 2 AC 296 , 335C per Lord Slynn of Hadley . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1474	And in providing the reference he owes a duty of care to his employee or former employee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1475	Again , I have the greatest difficulty in believing that Parliament could have intended that it should be unlawful for an employer to discriminate in giving or withholding references for existing employees but perfectly lawful for him to do so in the case of ex-employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1476	Parliament often has to draw lines - and indeed does so explicitly in various ways in the anti-discrimination Acts , e g by limiting their application in the case of domestic employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1477	It is not hard to see the reason for that . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1478	It is very much harder to see why Parliament would have chosen to draw an arbitrary line through the continuing effects of the employment relationship rather than leave the ban on discrimination to expire as and when those effects themselves were spent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1479	In particular , I am not impressed by the spectre of the supposed difficulties for employers if proceedings could be brought for discrimination in failing to provide a reference or in providing an unsatisfactory reference some time after the employee had left his employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1480	If such proceedings were brought , there is little reason to suppose that the difficulties for the employer would be significantly greater than those entailed in defending a negligence claim in relation to a request for a reference made at about the same time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1481	And , of course , in any such proceedings the applicant will have to show that the former employer treated him or her less favourably than other former employees in similar circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1482	213 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1483	As an argument against holding that the Acts make it unlawful to discriminate against former employees , it is pointed out - correctly - that the pre-legislative materials make no mention of discrimination against them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1484	Moreover , it is said , if the draftsman of section 6 of the 1975 Act , for instance , had intended to cover former employees , he might have been expected to do so specifically in a separate subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- , to mirror subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- dealing with job applicants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1485	These arguments , which are interlinked , really amount to saying that the lack of any positive sign that Parliament considered the position of former employees shows that it did not in fact intend to make discrimination unlawful in the case of former employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1486	So in Rhys-Harper v Relaxion Group plc -LSB- 2001 -RSB- EWCA Civ 634 ; -LSB- 2001 -RSB- ICR 1176 the Court of Appeal were correct to interpret subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- as they did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1487	214 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
254	1488	At first sight the argument may appear quite persuasive , on mature reflection less so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1489	For the reasons I have given , I do not find the lack of discussion of the particular position of former employees significant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1490	What would have been significant , not to say remarkable , would have been any hint that the government of the day , or Parliament itself , ever contemplated that it was to remain lawful for employers to discriminate against former employees on , say , racial grounds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1491	So far as the drafting of the sections is concerned , if discrimination against job applicants was to be outlawed , a separate provision was obviously necessary since on no view can they fall within subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1492	That subsection is drafted to deal with the very different situation of people who have gone a step further and have actually been employed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1493	Former employees are different from job applicants in this respect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1494	Some of the kinds of discrimination listed in subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- - e g failing to offer opportunities for promotion or dismissing someone - are such that only a current employee can be subjected to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1495	Others could apply to both current and former employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1496	It is not suggested that there is some other class of conduct by employers that would have to be made unlawful solely in the case of former employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1497	Therefore , the provision as drafted , making it unlawful for employers to discriminate against employees in various ways , could in principle operate perfectly satisfactorily in respect of former employees without there being any need either to discuss their position separately or to make separate provision for them in a further subsection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1498	Everything thus depends on whether the wording of the provision in subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- is capable of covering both current and former employees - which is simply the point at issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1499	215 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1500	The words in section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1975 Act which are said to confine the provision to current employees are `` a woman employed by him at an establishment in Great Britain '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1501	They comprise the noun phrase `` a woman '' and the non-finite clause `` employed by him at an establishment in Great Britain '' which modifies the noun phrase . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1502	In that clause `` employed '' is a passive participle and , as such , it is inherently ambiguous . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1503	Discounting any other possibility , the words may be the equivalent of `` a woman who is employed by him at an establishment in Great Britain '' or `` a woman who is or was employed by him at an establishment in Great Britain '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1504	One can not tell how the participle is to be interpreted from looking at these words alone : it must be interpreted in the context of the provision as a whole . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1505	Often the wider context in which the participle is used will point definitely one way or the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1506	So , for instance , if I say `` John is very worried about productivity in his firm and is inviting everyone employed by him to a meeting to discuss improvements '' , the obvious meaning is that the invitation is addressed to current employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1507	On the other hand , sometimes the context may not fully resolve the matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1508	If I say `` John , who has been in business for 20 years , is inviting everyone employed by him to a party to celebrate '' , someone listening to me might not be sure what to expect but he would not be unduly surprised to find former as well as current employees at the party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1509	Similarly , in my view , the context of the words within the legislative sentence in section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- leaves the matter open : looked at merely in that context , the passive participle could be interpreted in either way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1510	Although most of the opportunities listed in paragraph -LRB- a -RRB- may be relevant only to current employees , the examples that I have already given are enough to show that the paragraph could sensibly apply to the situation of former employees , while in paragraph -LRB- b -RRB- the notion of `` subjecting someone to a detriment '' is so broad that , indisputably , it could apply to refusing a reference to a former employee , for instance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1511	Unlike section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1976 Act uses the word `` employee '' but , as Pill LJ noted in Rhys-Harper v Relaxion Group plc -LSB- 2001 -RSB- ICR 1176 , 1182 , para 13 , the presence or absence of that term can not be critical to the interpretation of these provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1512	In what is largely a matter of impression , I am respectfully unable to share the view of Peter Gibson LJ in Post Office v Adekeye -LSB- 1997 -RSB- ICR 110 , 118B that in section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1976 Act the crucial words can only mean `` in the case of a person who is employed by him '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1513	Since that is not the only possible meaning in either the 1975 or 1976 Act , the wider considerations discussed above persuade me that the provisions should be interpreted as making it unlawful to discriminate against former employees as well as current employees if there is a substantive connexion between the discriminatory conduct and the employment relationship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1514	In other words the former employer must discriminate qua former employer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1515	I find nothing in the other provisions on employment in the statutes to invalidate that interpretation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1516	Despite the difference in language , there is no indication that Parliament intended the 1995 Act to be different in this respect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1517	Therefore , given the similarity of the general aims of the anti-discrimination Acts , I would interpret the words `` a person whom he employs '' in section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- in the same way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1518	The House is not called on in these appeals to decide whether the duty in section 6 of that Act also applies in the case of former employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1519	216 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1520	I should add that , even if I had not been disposed to construe section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1976 Act in this way , I should in any event have concluded that the decision in Post Office v Adekeye was wrong on the basis of the narrower line of reasoning adopted by my noble and learned friend , Lord Scott of Foscote . 	lord rodger	lord scott	partagr	1	NAN
254	1521	Unfortunately , in an organisation where racial discrimination is practised an employee is just as liable to encounter it in the internal appeal as in the original dismissal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1522	Reluctantly , the Court of Appeal felt obliged to hold , however , that , while it would have been unlawful for the Post Office to discriminate against Ms Adekeye when dismissing her , it would have been perfectly lawful for them to do so when determining her internal appeal from that self-same dismissal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1523	The result is so startling as in itself to cast doubt on the construction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1524	And indeed , even on a fairly strict construction , it would not have been difficult to regard the applicant as `` a person employed by '' the Post Office in terms of section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1525	After all , at the time of the internal appeal the employment relationship was not severed irrevocably : if the appeal had succeeded , the applicant would have been reinstated as an employee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1526	Only a rather literal , as opposed to a purposive , reading of the words `` a person employed by him '' would lead to the conclusion that someone in that twilight zone was no longer `` employed '' and had lost her rights under section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1527	For the reasons I have given , however , I prefer to approach the matter on the footing that , even if Ms Adekeye was indeed to be regarded as a former employee at the time of her internal appeal , she was still within the scope of section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1528	217 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1529	Compelling support for the interpretation of section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1975 Act which I prefer is to be found in the Community law background . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1530	The 1975 Act , which was passed while the Equal Treatment Directive was in preparation , was not subsequently amended when the directive came into force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1531	In that situation , of course , as was explained by the Court of Justice in Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentación SA C-106 / 89 -LSB- 1990 -RSB- ECR I-4135 , 4159 , para 8 , when interpreting the 1975 Act , any tribunal or court in this country `` is required to do so , so far as possible , in the light of the wording and the purpose of the directive in order to achieve the result pursued by the latter and thereby comply with the third paragraph of Article 189 of the Treaty . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1532	In Coote v Granada Hospitality Ltd -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 1999 -RSB- ICR 942 the applicant first brought a claim against her employers alleging that they had discriminated against her on the ground of her sex by dismissing her because she was pregnant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1533	That claim was settled but she later brought further proceedings complaining that she was unable to obtain new employment because , in retaliation for her previous proceedings against them , her employers had consistently failed to provide references when asked to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1534	More particularly , her complaint was that , in terms of sections 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- of the 1975 Act , it had been unlawful for her employers to discriminate against her by subjecting her to the detriment of failing to provide her with references when they would have provided them to persons who had not previously complained of sex discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1535	For present purposes what matters is that , in order to succeed , the applicant , who was no longer employed by the employers at the time of the alleged discrimination , had none the less to be regarded as `` a woman employed by '' Granada Hospitality for the purposes of section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1536	Consideration of this point in turn raised an issue as to the effect of the Equal Treatment Directive which the EAT referred to the Court of Justice in November 1996 , just a week after the Court of Appeal had given judgment in Post Office v Adekeye . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1537	218 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1538	Article 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Equal Treatment Directive provides : `` Application of the principle of equal treatment with regard to working conditions , including the conditions governing dismissal , means that men and women shall be guaranteed the same conditions without discrimination on grounds of sex . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1539	Articles 6 and 7 are in these terms : `` 6 Member States shall introduce into their national legal systems such measures as are necessary to enable all persons who consider themselves wronged by failure to apply to them the principle of equal treatment within the meaning of articles 3 , 4 and 5 to pursue their claims by judicial process after possible recourse to other competent authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1540	7 Member States shall take the necessary measures to protect employees against dismissal by the employer as a reaction to a complaint within the undertaking or to any legal proceedings aimed at enforcing compliance with the principle of equal treatment . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1541	Despite the specific reference to retaliation by way of dismissal in article 7 , in Coote v Granada Hospitality Ltd C-186 / 97 -LSB- 1999 -RSB- ICR 100 , 113 , paras 27 and 28 , the Court of Justice held that , having regard to the objective of the directive and the fundamental nature of the right to effective judicial protection , `` article 6 of the Directive requires member states to introduce into their national legal systems such measures as are necessary to ensure judicial protection for workers whose employer , after the employment relationship has ended , refuses to provide references as a reaction to legal proceedings brought to enforce compliance with the principle of equal treatment within the meaning of the Directive . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1542	The EAT then had to apply the guidance given by the Court of Justice to the interpretation of section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1975 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1543	They were faced with an argument by the employers that the proper construction of that provision had in effect been settled by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Adekeye on the interpretation of section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1976 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1544	The EAT rejected that argument , in the end because they considered that they had to apply the decision of the Court of Justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1545	Having examined the language of section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , and in order to achieve the result pursued by article 6 of the directive as interpreted by the Court of Justice , the EAT found it possible to hold , and did indeed hold , that the words `` a woman employed by him '' were apt to cover a former employee , such as the applicant , complaining of victimisation : Coote v Granada Hospitality Ltd -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 1999 -RSB- ICR 942 .

254	1546	The employers did not appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN

254	1548	In Rhys-Harper v Relaxion Group plc -LSB- 2001 -RSB- ICR 1176 , 1184 - 1185 , paras 23 - 26 , Buxton LJ sharply criticised the decision of the EAT in Coote No 2 on the ground that it had not been open to them to do other than apply Post Office v Adekeye . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1549	Unlike Lord Scott of Foscote , I am very doubtful whether that criticism was justified , given the duty imposed on the EAT by article 249 -LRB- ex 189 -RRB- of the EC Treaty and by the Marleasing line of authority . 	lord rodger	lord scott	partdisa	1	NAN
254	1550	The Court of Justice had indeed restated that duty in Coote v Granada Hospitality Ltd -LSB- 1999 -RSB- ICR 100 , 110 para 18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1551	It is unnecessary , however , to go into the question on this occasion since any supposed constraint imposed by Post Office v Adekeye falls away once that decision is itself seen to have been incorrect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1552	As I have noted already , in the context of section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- the words `` a woman employed by him '' are ambiguous . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1553	In that situation I consider that in Coote No 2 Morison J was correct to hold that the EAT could , and therefore should , interpret them in such a way that section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- would apply to a former employee who complained of victimisation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1554	I note that - before Buxton LJ 's comments - in Hall v Woolston Hall Leisure Ltd -LSB- 2001 -RSB- ICR 99 , 116 , para 59 , Mance LJ , with whom Moore-Bick J agreed , cited the decision of the EAT in Coote No 2 as an illustration of the kind of approach to interpretation that the decision in Marleasing required of a court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1555	220 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1556	As Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead has pointed out , the interpretation of the critical words in section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- which is required by the ruling of the Court of Justice in Coote can not be confined to cases of victimisation . 	lord rodger	lord nicholls	partagr	1	NAN
254	1557	The words of the subsection can not mean one thing in victimisation cases and something else in other cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1558	What constitutes discrimination for purposes of section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- is to be found in Part I of the Act , including both sections 1 and 4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1559	So , if it is unlawful for an employer to `` discriminate '' against a former employee in terms of section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- by victimising her under section 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , it must equally be unlawful for the employer to `` discriminate '' against a former employee in terms of section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- by treating her less favourably on the ground of her sex under section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1560	This confirms the conclusion , reached on an examination of the domestic law , that section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- applies generally so as to make it unlawful to discriminate against former as well as current employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1561	The equivalent words in the other Acts fall to be interpreted in the same way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1562	221 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1563	For these reasons , and for those given by Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead , I respectfully agree with his interpretation of the relevant provisions in the three Acts . 	lord rodger	lord nicholls	fullagr	1	NAN
254	1564	I also agree both with the way he would apply that interpretation in the individual appeals and with what he says about the separate issue in D'Souza v London Borough of Lambeth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
254	1565	I would accordingly refuse that appeal but allow the others . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
