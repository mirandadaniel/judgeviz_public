296	4	Introduction 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
296	5	The appellants are two young Somalis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
296	6	The first appellant was born on 1 January 1991 and the second on 1 January 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
296	7	When leave to appeal to the House was granted they were living in Ethiopia . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
296	8	They were appealing against the refusal of entry clearance which would have permitted them to enter the United Kingdom to live with their cousin , Ms Omar , who sponsored their application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
296	9	Ms Omar is a recognised refugee who is settled in the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
296	10	She acts as the litigation friend for the second appellant , who is still a child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
296	11	On 30 October 2008 the appellants were granted entry clearance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
296	12	They travelled to this country on 21 November 2008 and now live with Ms Omar . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	13	The House decided to entertain their appeal despite this because it raises an issue that is likely to affect a substantial number of other applicants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	14	The issue in question relates to the effect of section 85 -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 -LRB- `` the 2002 Act '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	15	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	16	Where members of the family of a refugee who has been given leave to remain in this country seek to join the refugee for the purpose of family reunion it is the policy of the Home Department to have regard to the right to respect for family life guaranteed by article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	17	It is the appellants ' case that section 85 -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the 2002 Act , if read literally , is incompatible with article 8 , but that it is possible to remedy this by ` reading down ' the subsection pursuant to section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	18	The Court of Appeal , in a single judgment delivered by Sedley LJ -LSB- 2008 -RSB- EWCA Civ 149 , held that section 85 -LRB- 5 -RRB- could not be read down as it was `` unequivocal and unyielding '' , but that it was not incompatible with the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	19	The appellants ' case 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	20	Section 82 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 2002 Act gives a right of appeal against an immigration decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	21	Section 82 -LRB- 2 -RRB- sets out a list of 11 decisions that fall within the definition of `` immigration decision '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	22	These include : `` -LRB- a -RRB- refusal of leave to enter the United Kingdom , -LRB- b -RRB- refusal of entry clearance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	23	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	24	. '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	25	Where a person outside the country wishes to enter the United Kingdom his proper course is to apply for entry clearance to an entry clearance officer in the country where he is living . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	26	If entry clearance is granted , leave to enter follows automatically . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	27	Where a person manages to enter the United Kingdom without entry clearance and wishes to remain his appropriate course is to make an application for leave to enter to an immigration officer in this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	28	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	29	Section 85 of the 2002 Act , in its original form , provided : '' ... -LRB- 4 -RRB- On an appeal under section 82 -LRB- 1 -RRB- ... against a decision an adjudicator may consider evidence about any matter which he thinks relevant to the substance of the decision , including evidence which concerns a matter arising after the date of the decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	30	-LRB- 5 -RRB- But in relation to an appeal under section 82 -LRB- 1 -RRB- against refusal of entry clearance ... -LRB- a -RRB- subsection -LRB- 4 -RRB- shall not apply , and -LRB- b -RRB- the adjudicator may consider only the circumstances appertaining at the time of the decision to refuse . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	31	Those subsections applied in their original form at the time of the events that have given rise to this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	32	In order to comply with the current regime , they have since been amended so as to substitute `` the Tribunal '' for `` an adjudicator '' in section 85 -LRB- 4 -RRB- and `` the adjudicator '' in section 85 -LRB- 5 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	33	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	34	The manner in which these provisions operated in the present case was described by Sedley LJ in the following passage of his judgment : `` 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	35	In July 2003 the appellants applied for entry clearance ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
296	36	The entry clearance officer in Addis Ababa , having referred the application to the Home Office , refused it by a decision dated 24 August 2004 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	37	The delay in taking a decision of this importance to those involved seems inordinate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	38	On 25 October 2004 an appeal was lodged against the refusal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	39	For reasons which again are completely unaccounted for , and which it has to be inferred amount to no more than inertia in the Home Office , the papers did not reach the AIT until 9 March 2006 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	40	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	41	In the intervening period the appellants ' situation had changed very much for the worse . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	42	When the appeal came on before IJ Oliver on 6 April 2006 , the appellants ' counsel conceded that , because of the need to rely on public funds , he could not pursue the appeal within the Immigration Rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	43	Instead he based his case on the Home Secretary 's family reunion policy , which allowed for admission of family members outside the rules in ` compelling , compassionate circumstances ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	44	The immigration judge accepted that he was entitled to take into account the serious neglect into which the appellants had fallen since the refusal of entry clearance in 2004 , and went on to find that the combination of compassionate circumstances with the appellants ' article 8 rights entitled them to succeed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	45	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	46	On reconsideration , SIJ Spencer , by a determination promulgated on 9 March 2007 , held that IJ Oliver in 2006 had not been entitled to take into account events postdating the refusal of entry clearance in 2004 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	47	He went on to hold that the evidence of the appellants ' situation at the earlier date passed neither the compassionate circumstances test of the policy nor what he took to be the exceptionality test for art. 8 protection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	48	He accordingly substituted decisions dismissing both appeals . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	49	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	50	For the appellants Mr Manjit Gill QC drew attention to the delay that the procedure had involved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	51	He submitted that no sensible reason could be advanced for precluding the consideration , on an appeal against a decision refusing entry clearance , of matters arising after the date of the decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	52	If such matters could be considered on an appeal against refusal of leave to enter there was no reason why they should not equally be considered on an appeal against a refusal of entry clearance , for there was in reality no longer any significant distinction between entry clearance and leave to enter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	53	The effect of such a requirement was to cause unreasonable and lengthy delay in bringing a family together . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	54	This was incompatible with the respect for family life required by article 8 of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	55	Discussion 7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	56	It seems to me that Mr Gill 's complaint is of a defect of procedure rather than of substance , albeit that defects in procedure may be capable of leading to an infringement of a substantive right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	57	In this case there has been , as Sedley LJ observed , inordinate delay . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	58	He might , I think , have described the delay by a less temperate adjective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	59	But the delay was not endemic in the system and it was certainly not a consequence of the prohibition , on an appeal against a decision on entry clearance , of consideration of matters arising since the date of the decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
296	60	The delay that occurred related in the first instance to the taking of the decision and in the second instance to the determination of the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
296	61	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
296	62	The Home Department Entry Clearance Guidance of 27 December 2007 provides in General Instructions , Chapter 27 on `` Appeals '' : `` 27.8 - Fresh application while an appeal is outstanding There is nothing in law to prevent a person who has an appeal pending from making a fresh application for entry clearance in the same or any other category . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
296	63	There is no requirement for a person to withdraw an appeal before allowing a further application to be made ... '' In this case the appellants could have made a fresh application as soon as their circumstances changed for the worse and I think that this would have been the appropriate course to take , having regard to the provisions of section 85 -LRB- 5 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
296	64	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
296	65	Contrary to Mr Gill 's submissions , I consider that there is good reason for the distinction that this subsection draws between decisions on entry clearance and decisions on leave to enter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
296	66	Where a change of circumstances is alleged by someone who is outside the jurisdiction , the entry clearance officer will often be best placed to evaluate the effect of this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
296	67	That would certainly seem to have been the position in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
296	68	In such circumstances it is not illogical to require a fresh application for entry clearance to be made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
296	69	Where , however , an appeal is made against refusal of leave to enter by an appellant who is within the jurisdiction , consideration must necessarily be given to the position prevailing when the appeal is heard , at least where human rights are in issue as they usually are , for an adverse decision on the appeal will render the appellant liable to deportation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
296	70	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
296	71	Thus the provisions of section 85 -LRB- 4 -RRB- and -LRB- 5 -RRB- are neither irrational nor calculated to result in unjustified delay in the consideration , where this is in issue , of the implications of the right to respect for family life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
296	72	For these reasons I have concluded that section 85 -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the 2002 Act is not incompatible with the Convention and that this appeal should be dismissed . 	lord phillips	self	outcome	0.3	NAN

296	83	I agree with my noble and learned friend Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers that it has not been shown that the provisions of section 85 -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which exclude matters arising after the decision to refuse entry clearance from consideration in the event of an appeal by the adjudicator are incompatible with article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights , and that the appeal must be dismissed . 	lord hope	lord phillips	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	83	I agree with my noble and learned friend Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers that it has not been shown that the provisions of section 85 -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which exclude matters arising after the decision to refuse entry clearance from consideration in the event of an appeal by the adjudicator are incompatible with article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights , and that the appeal must be dismissed . 	lord hope	self	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	84	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	85	Mr Manjit Gill QC accepted that it would be difficult for him to maintain that the rule that section 85 -LRB- 5 -RRB- lays down for entry clearance cases was incompatible with article 8 in cases where no member of the applicant 's family was already in the United Kingdom at the time when the application was made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	86	What was objectionable was the fact that it imposed a blanket ban that applied to all cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	87	The core of his argument , as he put it , was to be found in cases where a family member of the applicant was already present in this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	88	What article 8 required was an effective procedure for bringing families together without undue delay and which did not put obstacles in an applicant 's way that were disproportionate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	89	The rule was incompatible with this requirement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	90	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	91	Mr Gill acknowledged that there was nothing in law to prevent the making of a fresh application for entry clearance while an appeal was outstanding . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	92	But having to resort to a fresh application in such cases would create delay . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	93	The need to pay a further fee for it could , due to lack of resources , be excessively burdensome . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	94	The contrast between that situation and that provided for by section 85 -LRB- 4 -RRB- , which enables the up-to-date position to be looked at without delay and without the need for a further fee , showed that the rule in section 85 -LRB- 5 -RRB- was disproportionate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	95	Addressing the facts , where circumstances had changed for the worse , was not likely to give rise to any practical difficulty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	96	He accepted that it might be going too far to hold that the rule was incompatible with article 8 , as family re-unification was not likely to be a factor in all cases where entry clearance was being sought . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	97	He said that what he was really asking for was a limited reading down of the subsection to enable account to be taken of the up-to-date circumstances in all cases where family re-unification was in issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	98	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	99	The question , as I see it , is not whether the distinction that the subsection draws between decisions on entry clearance and decisions on leave to enter is illogical , irrational or unreasonable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	100	It was for Parliament to decide whether it was appropriate to make that distinction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	101	The rule is set out in primary legislation , so it is not open to judicial review on those grounds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	102	The doctrine of Parliamentary sovereignty precludes this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	103	The rule does not require any further justification than that Parliament regarded the system that it lays down as acceptable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	104	But Parliament has also declared in the Human Rights Act 1998 that the Convention rights set out in Schedule 1 to the Act must be given effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	105	This means that legislation must , where possible , be read compatibly with Convention rights : section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	106	Entry clearance officers , adjudicators and the courts act unlawfully if they do not act compatibly with a person 's Convention rights : section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
296	107	That subsection does not apply if , as a result of one or more provisions of primary legislation , they could not have acted differently . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
296	108	But a declaration of incompatibility may be made if the rule is inescapably incompatible with a Convention right : section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
296	109	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
296	110	It is not difficult to see that there may be entry clearance cases - indeed there may be many - which engage the applicant 's right to respect for his or her family life under article 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
296	111	As Baroness Hale of Richmond pointed out in Beoku-Betts v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2008 -RSB- UKHL 39 ; -LSB- 2009 -RSB- 1 AC 115 , para 4 , the right to respect for the family life of one necessarily encompasses the right to respect for the family life of others with whom that family life is enjoyed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
296	112	The question that these cases raise is whether any interference with that right which results from the rule that section 85 -LRB- 5 -RRB- lays down is compatible with article 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
296	113	Article 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- declares that there shall be no interference with the exercise of the right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary , on various grounds , in a democratic society . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
296	114	In the present context it is to the phrase `` in accordance with the law '' that the issue is directed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
296	115	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
296	116	The principle of legality requires the court to address itself to three distinct questions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
296	117	The first is whether there is a legal basis in domestic law for the restriction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
296	118	The second is whether the law or rule in question is sufficiently accessible to the individual who is affected by the restriction , and sufficiently precise to enable him to understand its scope and foresee the consequences of his actions so that he can regulate his conduct without breaking the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
296	119	The third is whether , assuming that these two requirements are satisfied , it is nevertheless open to the criticism on the Convention ground that it was applied in a way that is arbitrary because , for example , it has been resorted to in bad faith or in a way that is not proportionate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
296	120	I derive these principles , which have been mentioned many times in subsequent cases , from Sunday Times v United Kingdom -LRB- 1979 -RRB- 2 EHRR 245 , para 49 and also from Winterwerp v The Netherlands -LRB- 1979 -RRB- 2 EHRR 387 , pp 402-403 , para 39 and Engel v The Netherlands -LRB- No 1 -RRB- -LRB- 1976 -RRB- 1 EHRR 647 , p 669 , paras 58-59 which were concerned with the principle of legality in the context of article 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
296	121	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
296	122	The European Court has not identified a consistent or uniform set of principles when considering the doctrine of proportionality : see Richard Clayton , Regaining a Sense of Proportion : The Human Rights Act and the Proportionality Principle -LSB- 2001 -RSB- EHRLR 504 , 510 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
296	123	But there is a general international understanding as to the matters which should be considered where a question is raised as to whether an interference with a fundamental right is proportionate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
296	124	These matters were identified in the Privy Council case of de Freitas v Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Agriculture , Fisheries , Lands and Housing -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 1 AC 69 by Lord Clyde . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
296	125	He adopted the three stage test which is to be found in the analysis of Gubbay CJ in Nyambirai v National Social Security Authority -LSB- 1996 -RSB- 1 LRC 64 , where he drew on jurisprudence from South Africa and Canada : see also R -LRB- Daly -RRB- v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2001 -RSB- UKHL 26 ; -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 2 AC 532 , 547A-B per Lord Steyn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
296	126	The first is whether the objective which is sought to be achieved is sufficiently important to justify limiting the fundamental right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
296	127	The second is whether the means chosen to limit that right are rational , fair and not arbitrary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
296	128	The third is whether the means used impair the right as minimally as is reasonably possible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
296	129	In R -LRB- SB -RRB- v Governors of Denbigh High School -LSB- 2006 -RSB- UKHL 15 ; -LSB- 2007 -RSB- 1 AC 100 , para 26 , Lord Bingham of Cornhill summed the matter up succinctly when he said that the limitation or interference must be directed to a legitimate purpose and must be proportionate in scope and effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
296	130	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	131	Mr Gill 's argument , therefore , was that section 85 -LRB- 5 -RRB- is incompatible with the right to respect for the family under article 8 because the restriction that it imposes is not proportionate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	132	I am willing to recognise that there may be some cases where entry clearance is sought in which it will be necessary to grapple with this issue , but in my opinion this is not one of them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	133	It is the generality of his proposition that leads him into a difficulty which I regard as insurmountable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	134	He submits that section 85 -LRB- 5 -RRB- should be read down to enable the adjudicator to look at all the circumstances because it is likely that the restriction will affect a substantial number of other applicants or , if this is not possible , that there should be a declaration of incompatibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	135	I agree with Sedley LJ that the language of section 85 -LRB- 5 -RRB- is incapable of being read down in the way Mr Gill suggested . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	136	The directions that it contains could not be put more plainly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	137	Subsection -LRB- 4 -RRB- `` shall not apply '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	138	The adjudicator `` may consider only '' the circumstances appertaining at the time of the decision to refuse . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	139	These words are , as Sedley LJ said , unequivocal and unyielding : -LSB- 2008 -RSB- EWCA Civ 149 , para 16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	140	Reading them down would be to cross the boundary between interpretation and amendment of the statute : Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza -LSB- 2004 -RSB- UKHL 30 ; -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 2 AC 557 , para 121 , per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	141	Even if , as I am willing to assume , there may be cases where a decision to refuse to consider the up-to-date position could lead to an interference with the article 8 right in a way that was not proportionate , the adjudicator must abide by the terms of the statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	142	It will not be unlawful for him to do so , because the result of its provisions is that it is not open to him to act differently : 1998 Act , section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	143	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	144	There remains , then , the question whether there are grounds for making a declaration of incompatibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	145	Here the problem to which Mr Gill was unable to provide an effective answer lay in the generality of his submission that the provision was incompatible with article 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	146	There will be many cases where entry clearance is asked for where article 8 will not be in issue at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	147	There will be others where the matter can be dealt with quickly and the payment of a further fee will not be unduly burdensome . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	148	Looking at the matter more broadly , it may also be said that it is in the best interests of the effective working of the system of immigration control that the facts which an adjudicator has to examine in entry clearance cases should be those found locally by the entrance clearance officer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	149	Questions of credibility and reliability may be in issue which the local officer is likely to be best placed to determine . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	150	He may also be best placed to assess the significance of any fresh information in the overall context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	151	Delay of the kind that occurred in this case is , of course , deplorable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	152	But it was the product of poor administration , not of the rule itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	153	As a generality therefore the rule may be said to be directed to a legitimate purpose , and it does not seem to me to be disproportionate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
296	154	So I do not think that there are grounds for a general declaration that the rule is incompatible with the right to respect for the family . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
296	155	Mr Gill , as I understood him , saw the force of these points when at the end of his submissions he asked instead for the rule to be read down . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
296	156	But that , for the reasons I have given , is simply not possible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
296	157	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
296	158	I can not leave this case however without expressing concern at the effect that the delay and expense that the rule may give rise to , when compared with the ease of bringing into account up-to-date information , may have on individual cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
296	159	In R -LRB- SB -RRB- v Governors of Denbigh High School -LSB- 2006 -RSB- UKHL 15 ; -LSB- 2007 -RSB- 1 AC 100 , para 68 , Lord Hoffmann said that article 9 , which was in issue in that case , was concerned with substance , not procedure . 	lord hope	lord hoffmann	partagr	0.7	NAN
296	160	What mattered was the result : was the right restricted in a way which was not justified under article 9 -LRB- 2 -RRB- ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
296	161	I would apply that reasoning here too . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
296	162	The facts of this case are academic , as the appellants have been given leave to enter and are now in the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
296	163	But there may be other cases , where very young children or vulnerable adults are involved for example , in which respect for family life cries out for urgent attention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
296	164	The delay resulting from the need to start the procedure again , and to find the money to do so , may be so plainly out of keeping with the needs of the case that the application of the rule in their case may be found to be disproportionate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
296	165	Situations of that kind can only be dealt with on a case by case basis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
296	166	The effect of the legislation is that domestic law is incapable , even in those cases , of providing a remedy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
296	167	But the Secretary of State should bear in mind that they may be vulnerable to an adverse decision in Strasbourg , and I would not rule out the possibility of a declaration of incompatibility in an individual case if the circumstances were so clearly focussed as to enable the precise nature of the incompatibility with the applicant 's article 8 right to be identified .

296	169	BARONESS HALE OF RICHMOND 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
296	170	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
296	171	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
296	172	I too agree , for the reasons given by my noble and learned friend Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers , that this appeal must be dismissed . 	lady hale	lord phillips	fullagr	0.7	NAN
296	172	I too agree , for the reasons given by my noble and learned friend Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers , that this appeal must be dismissed . 	lady hale	self	outcome	0.7	NAN
296	173	But this decision does not preclude a finding , in later cases , that the actions of the public authorities involved have in fact been incompatible with the convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
296	174	It merely accepts that a law which states that the tribunal hearing appeals against the refusal of entry clearance from people who are abroad can only take into account the circumstances as they were at the time of the refusal , and not matters arising afterwards , is not in itself incompatible with the convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
296	175	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
296	176	It is worthwhile telling a little more of the story in this case , for it illustrates two things very well . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
296	177	The first is why Mr Manjit Gill QC , for the appellants , should have tried so hard to persuade us that the law was incompatible with the convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	178	But the other is that had the proper approach to article 8 rights been understood at the time , the problem should never have arisen . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	179	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	180	When they were refused entry clearance , on 24 August 2004 , the appellants Ahmed and Hadaya were children aged 13 and 9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	181	They are war orphans , their own parents having been killed in the Somali civil war in 1998 when they were aged seven and three . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	182	They were taken in by their sponsor 's mother and treated as part of her family . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	183	In 2000 the sponsor 's mother and father and husband were also killed and the sponsor took over responsibility for these two children as well as her own daughter Hafsa . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	184	She remarried the following year but not long after that she and her new husband were taken to a detention camp . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	185	Her new mother in law took over the care of all three children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	186	Then the sponsor was released from custody and escaped from Somalia , making her way to this country , where she was granted asylum on 14 June 2002 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	187	Shortly after this , her mother-in-law fled from Somalia to Ethiopia with the three children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	188	The sponsor kept in touch with the children there and sent small sums of money to her mother-in-law to maintain them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	189	Clearly she was continuing to accept responsibility for them as part of her own family . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	190	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	191	In July 2003 , all three children applied to join the sponsor in this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	192	Hafsa was granted entry clearance but in August 2004 the other two children were refused . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	193	They did not fall within either the immigration rules or the Somali family reunion policy -LRB- which had in any event been withdrawn by then -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	194	When they appealed , the Secretary of State reviewed the decision but maintained it , rejecting their claim that keeping the family apart was in breach of their right to respect for family life which is guaranteed by article 8 of the European Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	195	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	196	This was , of course , before some important decisions of this House on the inter-relationship between article 8 and immigration and asylum claims . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	197	In Huang v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2007 -RSB- UKHL 11 , -LSB- 2007 -RSB- 2 AC 167 , it was held that article 8 claims had to be decided on their merits . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	198	There was no test of ` exceptionality ' if claims fell outside the letter of the immigration rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	199	In Beoku-Betts v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2008 -RSB- UKHL 39 , -LSB- 2009 -RSB- 1 AC 115 , it was held that the interests of all family members have to be taken into account when assessing the article 8 claims of any of them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	200	Thus the right to respect for the family life enjoyed by the sponsor and all three of these children should be looked at in the round . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
296	201	As I said in Beoku-Betts , at para 4 , the totality of family life is greater than the sum of its individual parts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
296	202	Had the children 's claims been looked at in that light at the time it is , to say the least , possible that the outcome then would have been different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
296	203	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
296	204	However , by the time of the review , in February 2006 , the children 's situation had changed markedly for the worse . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
296	205	The sponsor 's husband had left her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
296	206	The mother in law blamed the sponsor for this and abdicated responsibility for the children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
296	207	In January 2005 she left them in the care of an old friend of the sponsor where they were not properly looked after . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
296	208	If this information had been before the Secretary of State , there was nothing to stop him taking it into account in deciding whether , in the changed circumstances , continuing to prevent this family from enjoying their family life together in this country could be justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
296	209	It is , to say the least , possible that his decision was incompatible with their convention rights irrespective of the powers of the appeal tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
296	210	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
296	211	When the appeal was first heard , in April 2006 , the immigration judge took into account the changed circumstances and held that there had been a breach of article 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
296	212	However , the Secretary of State applied for a review and in March 2007 a senior immigration judge held that it had been a material error of law for the first judge to take into account the change in circumstances since the decision was made in August 2004 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
296	213	That was , of course , the effect of section 85 -LRB- 4 -RRB- and -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 , set out by Lord Phillips at paragraph 4 above . 	lady hale	lord phillips	partagr	0.9	NAN
296	214	The senior immigration judge went on to dismiss the appeal , applying the exceptionality test to the article 8 claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
296	215	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
296	216	By the time the case reached the Court of Appeal in February 2008 , Huang had been decided in this House and the Secretary of State conceded that it was an error of law to determine the article 8 issue on the exceptionality test . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
296	217	As a result , the case was sent back to the tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
296	218	In August 2008 , the tribunal allowed the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
296	219	This suggests that , at the very least , had the first immigration judge applied the right tests , the appeal would have been allowed then . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
296	220	As a result of this decision , the appellants were granted entry clearance on 30 October 2008 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
296	221	They travelled here three weeks later and are now living with their sponsor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
296	222	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
296	223	These children should not have had to wait so long before being reunited with the only real family they have . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
296	224	But the reason that they have had to do so lies as much in the previous approach to article 8 claims as it does in the provisions of section 85 -LRB- 4 -RRB- and -LRB- 5 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
296	225	There is some logic in requiring out of country appeals against the refusal of entry clearance to be decided on the evidence as it was presented to the entry clearance officer on the ground at the time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
296	226	But the restrictions on the powers of appeal tribunals do not mean that other public authorities are exempt from their duty to act compatibly with the convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
296	227	We have been shown nothing which suggests that they are disabled from taking changes of circumstance into account without requiring a prohibitive fee for a fresh application every time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
296	228	It is the fee , as much as anything else , which may stand in the way of the system operating compatibly with the convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
296	229	It remains the duty of all concerned to respect those rights insofar as statute law allows them to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
