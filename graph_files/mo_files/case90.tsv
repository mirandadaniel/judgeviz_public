90	5	The issue in this appeal concerns the assessment of damages for loss of charter hire recoverable by a shipowner where a charterer repudiates a time charter of a vessel during its currency and he accepts that repudiation , there being an available market in which the shipowner can , at or shortly after the date of acceptance of repudiation , charter out the vessel for the balance of the charter term . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	6	The dispute between the parties turns on the date at which the quantification of damages is to be made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	7	The shipowners contend that the quantification should be made when , the repudiation having been made and accepted , they charter out -LRB- or may reasonably be expected to charter out -RRB- the vessel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	8	Events occurring later , not affecting the value of the contractual right which the owner has lost at that time , are irrelevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	9	The charterers contend that the quantification should be made as of the date on which the damages actually fall to be assessed , taking account of any event which has by then occurred which affects the value of what the owners lost as a result of his repudiation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	10	The maritime arbitrator who was the original decision-maker in this case -LRB- Mr Robert Gaisford -RRB- would have preferred to accept the owners ' contention , but felt constrained by first instance authority to accept the charterers ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	11	His decision was upheld by Langley J in the Commercial Court -LRB- -LSB- 2005 -RSB- EWHC 161 -LRB- Comm -RRB- , -LSB- 2005 -RSB- 1 All ER -LRB- Comm -RRB- 467 -RRB- and by Auld and Tuckey LJJ and Lord Mance in the Court of Appeal -LRB- -LSB- 2005 -RSB- EWCA Civ 1190 , -LSB- 2006 -RSB- 1 WLR 533 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	12	A majority of my noble and learned friends also agree with that decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	13	I have the misfortune to differ . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	14	I give my reasons for doing so , unauthoritative though they must be , since in my respectful opinion the existing decision undermines the quality of certainty which is a traditional strength and major selling point of English commercial law , and involves an unfortunate departure from principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	15	The facts 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	16	By a time charterparty on an amended Shelltime 4 form dated 10 July 1998 Golden Strait Corporation , a Liberian company , as owners chartered their tanker Golden Victory to Nippon Yusen Kubishika Kaisha of Tokyo as charterers for a period of 7 years with one month more or less in charterers ' option . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	17	The charterparty provided for payment of a minimum guaranteed base charter hire rate per day , increasing over the 7 years of the charter , but subject to a specified reduction if market rates should fall to a certain level . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	18	The owners were also to receive a share of operating profits earned by the charterers during the term of the charter above the base charter rate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	19	The charterparty provided -LRB- in clause 33 -RRB- that both owners and charterers should have the right to cancel the charter if war or hostilities were to break out between any two or more of a number of countries including the United States , the United Kingdom and Iraq . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	20	The charter was subject to English law and jurisdiction and there was an arbitration clause . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	21	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	22	On 14 December 2001 the charterers repudiated the charter by redelivering the vessel to the owners . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	23	The owners accepted the repudiation three days later , on 17 December , when the charter had nearly four years to run . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	24	The owners claimed damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	25	The charterers did not accept the claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	26	The matter was referred to arbitration and the arbitrator was asked to decide whether -LRB- and if so when -RRB- the charterers had repudiated the charter , whether -LRB- and if so when -RRB- the owners had accepted the repudiation , and what was the earliest date on which the vessel could be redelivered under the charter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	27	By an Interim Declaratory Award dated 16 September 2002 the arbitrator resolved the first two issues in the owners ' favour , as summarised above . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	28	He found 6 December 2005 to be the earliest date for contractual redelivery of the vessel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	29	This date was significant as the terminal date of the owners ' claim for damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	30	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
90	31	The charterers sought unsuccessfully to challenge this Award on appeal , and negotiations then followed for redelivery of the vessel to the charterers on the same terms -LRB- so far as material -RRB- as before , with settlement of damages for the period between the accepted repudiation and the redelivery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	32	The charterers made an offer to that effect on 7 February 2003 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	33	At that stage the owners , according to evidence recited by the arbitrator in the Reasons for his Second Declaratory Arbitration Award -LRB- para 8 -RRB- , had received legal advice that if they proceeded to arbitration of their damages claim the arbitrator would ignore a later event of war and the charterers ' option to cancel and would award the owners damages for the entire four year period between 17 December 2001 and 6 December 2005 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	34	The owners ' consultant considered that an event 15 months after the repudiation was irrelevant and that -LRB- para 10 -RRB- `` it would be sheer stupidity and not mitigation for us to enter into a charter well below the current market with a clause which entitled the charterer to cancel if there was a war , which seemed to be about to happen '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	35	The owners rejected the charterers ' offer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	36	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	37	The matter then returned to the arbitrator , who was asked to decide three further questions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	38	The first was whether the owners had failed to mitigate their loss by not accepting the charterers ' offer of 7 February 2003 to take the vessel back on charter on the same terms as before . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	39	In his Second Declaratory Arbitration Award dated 27 October 2004 he held that they had not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	40	There is no appeal against this ruling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	41	The second issue was that which gives rise to this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	42	It was whether the events -LRB- described as the outbreak of the Second Gulf War -RRB- in March 2003 placed a temporal limit on the damages recoverable by the owners for the charterers ' repudiation of the charterparty such that no damages were recoverable for the period from 21 March 2003 onwards . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	43	This issue the arbitrator reluctantly decided in the charterers ' favour . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	44	The owners say that he was wrong to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	45	The third issue was not explored in the reference and is irrelevant for present purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	46	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	47	In his reasons for deciding the first of these issues as he did , the arbitrator correctly summarised the law on mitigation of damage where there is an available market , as it was agreed , and the arbitrator found , was the case here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	48	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	49	In his reasons for deciding the second issue as he did , the arbitrator concluded that the Second Gulf War , which effectively began on 20 March 2003 , fell within clause 33 , as it plainly did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	50	He then considered the likelihood of the Second Gulf War occurring when judged from mid-December 2001 by a reasonably well-informed person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	51	This was an issue on which both sides called expert evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	52	He judged -LRB- para 59 -RRB- that at 17 December 2001 such a person would have considered war or large-scale hostilities between the United States or the United Kingdom and Iraq to be not inevitable or even probable but merely a possibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	53	But by the date of the Award , the war had occurred and the judge accepted the charterers ' evidence that if the charterparty had still been in force on 20 March 2003 they would have exercised their right to cancel under clause 33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	54	He had to decide whether that conclusion put a limit on the period of the owners ' recoverable loss or whether , as he put it , `` the question is what was the value of the contract that the Owners lost on the date it was lost '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	55	He observed -LRB- para 55 -RRB- that He favoured the owners ' position -LRB- para 56 -RRB- But -LRB- para 56 -RRB- he felt constrained to follow Timothy Walker J 's decision in BS & N Ltd -LRB- BVI -RRB- v Micado Shipping Ltd -LRB- Malta -RRB- -LRB- `` The Seaflower '' -RRB- -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 2 Lloyd 's Rep 37 which he found to be in point and indistinguishable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	56	Principle 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	57	The repudiation of a contract by one party -LRB- `` the repudiator '' -RRB- , if accepted by the other -LRB- `` the injured party '' -RRB- , brings the contract to an end and releases both parties from their primary obligations under the contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	58	The injured party is thereupon entitled to recover damages against the repudiator to compensate him for such financial loss as the repudiator 's breach has caused him to suffer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	59	This is elementary law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	60	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	61	The damages recoverable by the injured party are such sum as will put him in the same financial position as if the contract had been performed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	62	This is the compensatory principle which has long been recognised as the governing principle in contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	63	Counsel for the charterers cited certain classical authorities to make good this proposition , but it has been enunciated and applied times without number and is not in doubt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	64	It does not , however , resolve the question whether the injured party 's loss is to be assessed as of the date when he suffers the loss , or shortly thereafter , in the light of what is then known , or at a later date when the assessment happens to be made , in the light of such later events as may then be known . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	65	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	66	An injured party such as the owners may not , generally speaking , recover damages against a repudiator such as the charterers for loss which he could reasonably have avoided by taking reasonable commercial steps to mitigate his loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	67	Thus where , as here , there is an available market for the chartering of vessels , the injured party 's loss will be calculated on the assumption that he has , on or within a reasonable time of accepting the repudiation , taken reasonable commercial steps to obtain alternative employment for the vessel for the best consideration reasonably obtainable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	68	This is the ordinary rule whether in fact the injured party acts in that way or , for whatever reason , does not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	69	The actual facts are ordinarily irrelevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	70	The rationale of the rule is one of simple commercial fairness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	71	The injured party owes no duty to the repudiator , but fairness requires that he should not ordinarily be permitted to rely on his own unreasonable and uncommercial conduct to increase the loss falling on the repudiator . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	72	I take this summary to reflect the ruling of Robert Goff J in Koch Marine Inc v D'Amica Società di Navigazione ARL -LRB- The `` Elena D'Amico '' -RRB- -LSB- 1980 -RSB- 1 Lloyd 's Rep 75 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	73	That case concerned the measure of damages recoverable by a charterer for breach of a time charter during its currency by an owner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	74	While taking care to avoid laying down an inflexible or invariable rule , the judge held -LRB- p 89 , col 2 -RRB- that if , at the date of breach , there is an available market , the normal measure of damages will be the difference between the contract rate and the market rate for chartering in a substitute ship for the balance of the charter period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	75	An analogy was drawn with section 51 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Sale of Goods Act 1893 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	76	Neither party challenged this decision , which has always been regarded as authoritative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	77	It does however assume that the injured party knows , or can ascertain , what the balance of the charter period is . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	78	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	79	It is a general , but not an invariable , rule of English law that damages for breach of contract are assessed as at the date of breach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	80	Authority for this familiar proposition may be found in Jamal v Moolla Dawood Sons & Co -LSB- 1916 -RSB- AC 175 , 179 : Miliangos v George Frank -LRB- Textiles -RRB- Ltd -LSB- 1976 -RSB- AC 443 , 468 ; Johnson v Agnew -LSB- 1980 -RSB- AC 367 , 400-401 ; Dodd Properties -LRB- Kent -RRB- Ltd v Canterbury City Council -LSB- 1980 -RSB- 1 WLR 433 , 450-451 , 454-455 , 457 ; County Personnel -LRB- Employment Agency -RRB- Ltd v Alan R Pulver & Co -LSB- 1987 -RSB- 1 WLR 916 , 925-926 ; Chitty on Contracts , 29th ed -LRB- 2004 -RRB- , vol 1 , para 26-057 ; Professor S M Waddams , `` The Date for the Assessment of Damages '' , -LRB- 1981 -RRB- 97 LQR 445 , 446 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	81	The Sale of Goods Acts of 1893 and 1979 both give effect to this prima facie rule in section 51 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the respective Acts in the case of refusal or neglect by a seller to deliver goods to a buyer where there is an available market . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	82	The argument 12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	83	While not , I think , challenging the general correctness of the principles last stated , the charterers dispute their applicability to the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	84	Their first ground for doing so is in reliance on what , from the name of the case in which this principle has been most clearly articulated , has sometimes been called `` the Bwllfa principle '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	85	It is that where the court making an assessment of damages has knowledge of what actually happened it need not speculate about what might have happened but should base itself on the known facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	86	In non-judicial discourse the point has been made that you need not gaze into the crystal ball when you can read the book . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	87	I have , for my part , no doubt that this is in many contexts a sound approach in law as in life , and it is true that the principle has been judicially invoked in a number of cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	88	But these cases bear little , if any , resemblance to the present . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	89	In Bwllfa and Merthyr Dare Steam Collieries -LRB- 1891 -RRB- Limited v Pontypridd Waterworks Company -LSB- 1903 -RSB- AC 426 a coalowner claimed statutory compensation against a water undertaking which had , pursuant to statutory authority , prevented him mining his coal over a period during which the price of coal had risen . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	90	The question was whether the coal should be valued as at the beginning of the period or at its value during the currency of the period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	91	The coalowner was entitled to `` full compensation '' and the House upheld the latter measure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	92	In doing so , it was at pains to distinguish the case from one of sale or property transfer : see Lord Halsbury LC , pp 428-429 ; Lord Macnaghten , p 431 ; Lord Robertson , p 432 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
90	93	In re Bradberry -LSB- 1943 -RSB- Ch 35 , where the principle was invoked , concerned the valuation of an annuity in the course of administering an estate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	94	The claim in Carslogie Steamship Co Ltd v Royal Norwegian Government -LSB- 1952 -RSB- AC 292 was a claim by shipowners for loss of time during repairs of damage caused by a collision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	95	After the collision the ship had suffered heavy weather damage , which required the ship to be detained for repair of that damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	96	It was common ground that the ship would have been detained for the same period if the collision had never occurred -LRB- p 313 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	97	In In Re Thoars Deceased -LRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- EWHC 2416 -LRB- Ch -RRB- , unreported , 15 November 2002 -RRB- the principle was invoked in the course of deciding whether a policy of life insurance had been transferred at an undervalue within the meaning of section 339 of the Insolvency Act 1986 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	98	The principle was again invoked in McKinnon v E Survey Ltd -LRB- -LSB- 2003 -RSB- EWHC 475 -LRB- Ch -RRB- , unreported , 14 January 2003 -RRB- , a claim against negligent surveyors in which the court was asked to assume , for purposes of a preliminary issue , that the property had not been the subject of movement at the date of valuation and had not been subject to movement since , but that it would not have been possible to establish these facts until after the purchase of the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	99	In Aitchison v Gordon Durham & Company Limited -LRB- unreported , 30 June 1995 -RRB- the Court of Appeal applied the principle where a joint venture agreement to develop land had been broken and the court took account of what actually happened to decide what the claimant 's profit would have been . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	100	I do not think it necessary to discuss these cases , since it is clear that in some contexts the court may properly take account of later events . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	101	None of these cases involved repudiation of a commercial contract where there was an available market . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	102	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	103	The charterers further submit that even if , as a general rule , damages for breach of contract -LRB- or tort , often treated as falling within the same rule -RRB- are assessed as at the date of the breach or the tort , the court has shown itself willing to depart from this rule where it judges it necessary or just to do so in order to give effect to the compensatory principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	104	I accept that this is so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	105	But it is necessary to consider the cases in which the court departs from the general rule . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	106	Some are personal injury claims , of which Curwen v James -LSB- 1963 -RSB- 1 WLR 748 and Murphy v Stone-Wallwork -LRB- Charlton -RRB- Ltd -LSB- 1969 -RSB- 1 WLR 1023 may serve as examples . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	107	Dudarec v Andrews -LSB- 2006 -RSB- EWCA Civ 256 , -LSB- 2006 -RSB- 1 WLR 3002 was in form a negligence claim against solicitors , but damages were sought for the loss of a chance of success in a personal injuries action struck out for want of prosecution seven years earlier , and the issue was similar to that in a personal injuries action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	108	It is unnecessary to consider the extent to which , in the light of Baker v Willoughby -LSB- 1970 -RSB- AC 467 and Jobling v Associated Dairies Ltd -LSB- 1982 -RSB- AC 794 , the breach date principle applies to the assessment of personal injury damages in tort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	109	The court has also departed from the general rule in cases where , on particular facts , it was held to be reasonable for the injured party to defer taking steps to mitigate his loss and so reasonable to defer the assessment of damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	110	Radford v De Froberville -LSB- 1977 -RSB- 1 WLR 1262 and Dodd Properties -LRB- Kent -RRB- Ltd v Canterbury City Council -LSB- 1980 -RSB- 1 WLR 433 are examples . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	111	In both cases the general rule was acknowledged and reasons given for departing from it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	112	County Personnel -LRB- Employment Agency -RRB- Ltd v Alan Pulver & Co -LSB- 1987 -RSB- 1 WLR 916 was a claim against solicitors whose negligent advice had saddled the plaintiffs with a ruinous underlease , from which the plaintiffs had had to buy themselves out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	113	The ordinary diminution in value measure of damage was held to be wholly inapt on the particular facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	114	Again , reasons were given for departing from the normal rule . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	115	In Miliangos v George Frank -LRB- Textiles -RRB- Ltd -LSB- 1976 -RSB- AC 443 the effect of inflation led the House to sanction a departure from the rule that losses sustained in a foreign currency must be converted into sterling at the date of breach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	116	The plaintiff in Re-Source America International Ltd v Platt Site Services Ltd -LSB- 2005 -RSB- EWCA Civ 97 , -LSB- 2005 -RSB- 2 Lloyd 's Rep 50 was bailee of spools used to carry optic fibre cables which it was to refurbish . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	117	The spools were destroyed by fire . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	118	It was held to be entitled to recover the cost of replacing the spools , subject to a deduction based on the saved cost of refurbishment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	119	The Court of Appeal took account of what happened after the fire . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	120	It was expressly found -LRB- para 5 -RRB- that there was no available market in used spools , so the plaintiff could not have mitigated its loss by replacing them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	121	Sally Wertheim v Chicoutimi Pulp Company -LSB- 1911 -RSB- AC 301 , cited by the charterers , was not a case of non-delivery or refusal to deliver , but of delayed delivery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	122	The goods , although delivered late , were received and there was no accepted repudiation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	123	The case would not have fallen under section 51 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1893 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	124	The buyer made a claim for damages , based on the difference between the market price at the place of delivery when the goods should have been delivered and the market price there when the goods were in fact delivered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	125	It was apparent on the figures that this claim , if successful , would have yielded the plaintiff a much larger profit than if the contract had not been broken , and he was compensated for his actual loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	126	None of these cases , as is evident , involves the accepted repudiation of a commercial contract such as a charterparty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	127	It is necessary to consider some cases more similar to the present case to which the House was referred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	128	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	129	Considerable attention has been paid to the decision of the Court of Appeal -LRB- Lord Denning MR , Edmund Davies and Megaw LJJ -RRB- in Maredelanto Compania Naviera SA v Bergbau-Handel GmbH -LRB- `` The Mihalis Angelos '' -RRB- -LSB- 1971 -RSB- 1 QB 164 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	130	The case concerned a voyage charterparty by which the ship was fixed to sail to Haiphong and there load a cargo for delivery in Europe . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	131	In the charterparty dated 25 May 1965 the owners stated that the ship was `` expected ready to load under this charter about July 1 , 1965 '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	132	The charterparty also provided , in the first sentence of the cancelling clause , `` Should the vessel not be ready to load -LRB- whether in berth or not -RRB- on or before July 20 , 1965 , charterers have the option of cancelling this contract , such option to be declared , if demanded , at least 48 hours before vessel 's expected arrival at port of loading '' .

90	135	The charterers gave notice cancelling the charter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	136	The owners treated this as a repudiation and claimed damages , which were the subject of arbitration and of an appeal to Mocatta J. On further appeal , there were three issues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	137	The first was whether the `` expected readiness '' clause was a condition of which the owners were in breach , entitling the charterers to terminate the charter contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	138	All three members of the court decided this issue in favour of the charterers and against the owners . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	139	The second issue was whether -LRB- if the answer to the first issue was wrong -RRB- the charterers had repudiated the contract by cancelling on 17 July , three days before the specified 20 July deadline . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	140	Lord Denning held that they had not , but Edmund Davies and Megaw LJJ held that they had . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	141	The third issue was as to the damage suffered by the owners , on the assumption that the charterers ' premature cancellation had been a repudiation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	142	Lord Denning , in agreement with the arbitrators , who were themselves agreed , held that they had suffered no damage -LRB- p 197 -RRB- : Edmund Davies LJ agreed -LRB- p 202 -RRB- : Megaw LJ -LRB- at pp 209-210 -RRB- stated : It is evident that all members of the court were viewing the case as from the date of acceptance of the repudiation -LRB- although only Megaw LJ said so in terms -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	143	They were not taking account of later events . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	144	They were recognising , as was obvious on the facts as found , that the value of the contractual right which the owners had lost , as of the date of acceptance of the repudiation , was nil because the charter was bound to be lawfully cancelled three days later . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	145	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	146	If , as I think , the Court of Appeal 's decision on the third issue in the Mihalis Angelos was entirely orthodox , so was the decision of Mustill J in Woodstock Shipping Co v Kyma Compania Naviera SA -LRB- `` The Wave '' -RRB- -LSB- 1981 -RSB- 1 Lloyd 's Rep 521 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	147	This concerned a time charter for 24 months , 3 months more or less at charterers ' option . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	148	The owners repudiated the charter and the charterers accepted their repudiation on 2 August 1979 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
90	149	In assessing the charterers ' loss , and allowing for their ability to obtain a substitute fixture in the available market shortly after the date of the accepted repudiation , in accordance with the ruling in the Elena D'Amico , above , the judge compared the charterparty rate with the market rate in the early days of September 1979 , declining to speculate whether market rates in September 1981 would induce the charterers to exercise their three month option one way or the other .

90	167	The charterparty referred to various major oil company approvals including that of Mobil all on the point of expiring and provided that if during the charter term the owners lost one of these approvals they should reinstate the same within 30 days failing which the charterers would be at liberty to cancel the charterparty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	168	It also contained a guarantee by the owners to obtain an approval from Exxon within 60 days of the charter date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	169	The vessel was duly delivered but the owners had not obtained an Exxon approval from Exxon and did not do so within 60 days from the charter date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	170	On 30 December 1997 the charterers fixed the vessel to load a cargo of Exxon products . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	171	On the same date the charterers asked the owners if they had obtained the Exxon approval and gave notice requiring the owners to obtain it by 5 January 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	172	The owners replied that the vessel would be ready for Exxon inspection by late January or early February . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	173	The charterers responded by terminating the charter and redelivering the vessel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	174	At an initial hearing Aikens J held that the 60-day guarantee was an innominate term , not a condition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	175	Thus the charterers were not entitled to terminate , and had repudiated the charterparty , which the owners had accepted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	176	In proceedings initiated by the charterers , the owners counterclaimed for damages for wrongful termination of the charter , quantified as the difference between the daily hire rates in the charter and the alternative employment found for the vessel for the rest of the charter period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	177	The charterers met this claim by contending that the owners would have lost their Mobil approval on 27 January 1998 and would not have been able to regain it within 30 days , namely 26 February : therefore the charterers would be contractually entitled to cancel , and the owners ' damages should end then . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	178	Timothy Walker J discerned a difference between the three judgments in the Mihalis Angelos , discounting Megaw LJ 's formulation as that of a minority , but found on the facts , as established at 30 December 1997 , that the owners would have lost the Mobil approval on 27 January 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	179	This conclusion he found to be supported by evidence of what actually happened after 30 December . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	180	He concluded that it was inevitable that the charter would have come to an end on 26 February , and limited the owners ' damages accordingly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	181	This was , as I read the judgment , a conclusion he regarded as inevitable on 30 December . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	182	It does not appear that there was argument about the permissibility of relying on evidence of what happened later , and the judge can not have supposed that he was deciding any issue of principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	183	The result of this case was perhaps less obvious than that on the third issue in the Mihalis Angelos , but it was a judgment , on different facts , to very much the same effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	184	It was quite unlike the present case , because early termination was very clearly predictable on the date when the repudiation was accepted , and the judge only relied on evidence of later events to fortify his conclusion on that point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	185	I do not think he would have reached a different conclusion had he not received that evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

90	188	A forward freight swap agreement was treated as terminated because of the defendants ' breach of solvency guarantees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	189	It was common ground by the end of the trial that the injured party 's loss was to be measured by the difference between the contract rate and the market rate after the date of termination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	190	Toulson J recorded this agreement , observing -LRB- p 292 , col 2 -RRB- that `` The availability of a substitute market enables a market valuation to be made of what the innocent party has lost , and a line thereby to be drawn under the transaction '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

90	192	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	193	In support of their argument that damages should be assessed as of the date of actual assessment , the charterers contend that their claim attributable to loss of profit share would in any event have to be deferred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	194	Neither the arbitrator nor the judge mentioned this point , from which it seems safe to infer that the point was not at that stage relied on . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	195	But Lord Mance , giving the leading judgment in the Court of Appeal , did refer to it -LRB- para 25 -RRB- , and counsel for the owners accepted in argument that the assessment of the profit share loss would have had to be deferred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	196	I am far from convinced that counsel was right to accept this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	197	It would of course be very difficult to calculate loss of profit prospectively over a four year period , but an injured party can recover damages for the loss of a chance of obtaining a benefit -LRB- see Treitel , 11th ed , -LRB- 2003 -RRB- , pp 955-957 -RRB- and the difficulty of accurate calculation is not a bar to recovery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	198	Even if counsel is right on this point and I am wrong , this would not in my view be sufficient to displace the general rule in this context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	199	Conclusion 22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	200	The thrust of the charterers ' argument was that the owners would be unfairly over-compensated if they were to recover as damages sums which , with the benefit of hindsight , it is now known that they would not have received had there been no accepted repudiation by the charterers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	201	There are , in my opinion , several answers to this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	202	The first is that contracts are made to be performed , not broken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	203	It may prove disadvantageous to break a contract instead of performing it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	204	The second is that if , on their repudiation being accepted , the charterers had promptly honoured their secondary obligation to pay damages , the transaction would have been settled well before the Second Gulf War became a reality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	205	The third is that the owners were , as the arbitrator held -LRB- see para 7 above -RRB- , entitled to be compensated for the value of what they had lost on the date it was lost , and it could not be doubted that what the owners lost at that date was a charterparty with slightly less than four years to run . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	206	This was a clear and , in my opinion , crucial finding , but it was not mentioned in either of the judgments below , nor is it mentioned by any of my noble and learned friends in the majority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	207	On the arbitrator 's finding , it was marketable on that basis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	208	I can readily accept that the value of a contract in the market may be reduced if terminable on an event which the market judges to be likely but not certain , but that was not what the arbitrator found to be the fact in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	209	There is , with respect to those who think otherwise , nothing artificial in this approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	210	If a party is compensated for the value of what he has lost at the time when he loses it , and its value is at that time for any reason depressed , he is fairly compensated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	211	That does not cease to be so because adventitious later events reveal that the market at that time was depressed by the apprehension of risks that did not eventuate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	212	A party is not , after all , obliged to accept a repudiation : he can , if he chooses , keep the contract alive , for better or worse . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	213	By describing the prospect of war in December 2001 as `` merely a possibility '' , the expression twice used by the arbitrator in paragraph 59 of his reasons , the arbitrator can only have meant that it was seen as an outside chance , not affecting the marketable value of the charter at that time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	214	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	215	There is , however , a further answer which I , in common with the arbitrator , consider to be of great importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
90	216	He acknowledged the force of arguments advanced by the owners based on certainty -LRB- `` generally important in commercial affairs '' -RRB- , finality -LRB- `` the alternative being a running assessment of the state of play so far as the likelihood of some interruption to the contract is concerned '' -RRB- , settlement -LRB- `` otherwise the position will remain fluid '' -RRB- , consistency -LRB- `` the idea that a party 's accrued rights can be changed by subsequent events is objectionable in principle '' -RRB- and coherence -LRB- `` the date of repudiation is the date on which rights and damages are assessed '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	217	The judge was not greatly impressed by the charterers ' argument along these lines , observing -LRB- paras 13 , 35 -RRB- that although certainty is a real and beneficial target , it is not easily achieved , and the charterparty contained within it the commercial uncertainty of the war clause . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	218	Lord Mance similarly said -LRB- para 24 -RRB- : I can not , with respect , accept this reasoning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	219	The importance of certainty and predictability in commercial transactions has been a constant theme of English commercial law at any rate since the judgment of Lord Mansfield CJ in Vallejo v Wheeler -LRB- 1774 -RRB- 1 Cowp 143 , 153 -RRB- , and has been strongly asserted in recent years in cases such as Scandinavian Trading Tanker Co AB v Flota Petrolera Ecuatoriana -LRB- `` The Scaptrade '' -RRB- -LSB- 1983 -RSB- QB 529 , 540-541 , -LSB- 1983 -RSB- 2 AC 694 , 703-704 ; Homburg Houtimport BV v Agrosin Private Ltd -LSB- 2003 -RSB- UKHL 12 , -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 1 AC 715 , 738 ; Jindal Iron and Steel Co Ltd v Islamic Solidarity Shipping Co Jordan Inc -LRB- `` The Jordan II '' -RRB- -LSB- 2004 -RSB- UKHL 49 , -LSB- 2005 -RSB- 1 WLR 1363 , 1370 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	220	Professor Sir Guenter Treitel QC read the Court of Appeal 's judgment as appearing to impair this quality of certainty -LRB- `` Assessment of Damages for Wrongful Repudiation '' , -LRB- 2007 -RRB- 123 LQR 9-18 -RRB- and I respectfully share his concern . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	221	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	222	On my reading of The Seaflower -LRB- see para 19 above -RRB- , I do not think the arbitrator was bound by that decision to reach the conclusion he did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	223	If he was , I respectfully think the judge was wrong to analyse the Mihalis Angelos as he did in that case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	224	But on the facts Timothy Walker J was entitled to value the owners ' charter in that case at two months ' purchase as of the repudiation acceptance date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	225	In the present case , by contrast , the arbitrator found four years ' purchase -LRB- less a few days -RRB- as the true market value of the charterparty on the repudiation acceptance date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	226	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

90	234	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	235	The charterparty of 10 July 1998 whereby the appellants -LRB- the Owners -RRB- and the respondents -LRB- the Charterers -RRB- agreed on a charter of the vessel , Golden Victory , for a period ending on 6 December 2005 contained a provision -LRB- clause 33 -RRB- enabling either party to cancel the charter if war or hostilities should break out between any two or more of a number of named countries . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	236	The named countries included the USA , the UK and Iraq . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	237	The Charterers in breach of contract repudiated the charter on 14 December 2001 when the charter had nearly four years still to run -LRB- but subject , of course , to the clause 33 possibilities of cancellation -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	238	The Owners accepted the repudiation on 17 December 2001 and claimed damages for the Charterers ' breach of contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	239	The Owners ' claim went to arbitration and , after various issues had been determined by the arbitrator , all in the Owners ' favour , but before the arbitrator had assessed the quantum of the damages payable by the Charterers , the outbreak , in March 2003 , of the Second Gulf War occurred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	240	The Charterers said that if the charterparty had still been on foot when the Second Gulf War began they would have exercized their clause 33 right to bring the charter to an end . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	241	They submitted , therefore , that the Owners ' damages for their -LRB- the Charterers ' -RRB- breach of contract should be assessed by reference to the period from 17 December 2001 , when the contract came to an end on the Owners ' acceptance of their repudiation , to March 2003 , when the contract would have come to an end if it had still been on foot . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	242	The Owners disagreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	243	They said the damages should be assessed by reference to the value of their rights under the charterparty as at 17 December 2001 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	244	That assessment could properly take account of the chance , assessed as at 17 December 2001 , that a clause 33 event enabling one or other party to terminate the contract might occur , but should not take account of the actual occurrence of any event subsequent to 17 December 2001 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	245	The question was put to the arbitrator for decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	246	As your Lordships know , the arbitrator decided the question in favour of the Charterers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	247	Langley J did likewise and the Court of Appeal agreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	248	The question is now before your Lordships for a final decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	249	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	250	Two important matters that have , or may have , a bearing on the answer to the question are now common ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	251	First , it is common ground that , if the charterparty had still been on foot when , in March 2003 , hostilities between the USA and the UK on one side and Iraq on the other side began , the Charterers would have exercised their clause 33 right to terminate the charterparty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	252	Second , it is common ground that as at 17 December 2001 the chance that any hostilities triggering the clause 33 right of termination would break out was no more than a possibility and certainly not a probability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	253	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	254	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	255	the answer to the question at issue must depend on principles of the law of contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	256	It is true that the context in this case is a charterparty , a commercial contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	257	But the contractual principles of the common law relating to the assessment of damages are no different for charterparties , or for commercial contracts in general , than for contracts which do not bear that description . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	258	The fundamental principle governing the quantum of damages for breach of contract is long established and not in dispute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	259	The damages should compensate the victim of the breach for the loss of his contractual bargain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	260	The principle was succinctly stated by Parke B in Robinson v. Harman 1 Ex 850 at 855 and remains as valid now as it was then . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	261	If the contract is a contract for performance over a period , whether for the performance of personal services , or for supply of goods , or , as here , a time charter , the assessment of damages for breach must proceed on the same principle , namely , the victim of the breach should be placed , so far as damages can do it , in the position he would have been in had the contract been performed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	262	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	263	If a contract for performance over a period has come to an end by reason of a repudiatory breach but might , if it had remained on foot , have terminated early on the occurrence of a particular event , the chance of that event happening must , it is agreed , be taken into account in an assessment of the damages payable for the breach .

90	266	He said , at p. 210 , that : Another way of putting the point being made by Megaw LJ is that the claimant is entitled to the benefit , expressed in money , of the contractual rights he has lost , but not to the benefit of more valuable contractual rights than those he has lost .

90	267	In Wertheim v. Chicoutimi Pulp Co. -LSB- 1911 -RSB- AC 301 , Lord Atkinson referred , at 307 , to : and , in relation to a claim by a purchaser for damages for late delivery of goods where the purchaser had , after the late delivery , sold the goods for a higher price than that prevailing in the market on the date of delivery , observed , at 308 , that : 31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	268	The result contended for by the appellant in the present case is , to my mind , similar to that contemplated by Lord Atkinson in the passage last cited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	269	If the charterparty had not been repudiated and had remained on foot , it would have been terminated by the Charterers in or shortly after March 2003 when the Second Gulf War triggered the clause 33 termination option . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	270	But the Owners are claiming damages up to 6 December 2005 on the footing , now known to be false , that the charterparty would have continued until then . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	271	It is contended that because the Charterers ' repudiation and its acceptance by the Owners preceded the March 2003 event , the rule requiring damages for breach of contract to be assessed at the date of breach requires that event to be ignored . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	272	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	273	That contention , in my opinion , attributes to the assessment of damages at the date of breach rule an inflexibility which is inconsistent both with principle and with the authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	274	The underlying principle is that the victim of a breach of contract is entitled to damages representing the value of the contractual benefit to which he was entitled but of which he has been deprived . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
90	275	He is entitled to be put in the same position , so far as money can do it , as if the contract had been performed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

90	278	In Miliangos v Frank -LRB- Textiles -RRB- Ltd -LSB- 1976 -RSB- AC 443 Lord Wilberforce at 468 referred to `` the general rule '' that damages for breach of contract are assessed as at the date of breach but went on to observe that : and , when considering the date at which a foreign money obligation should be converted into sterling , chose the date that `` gets nearest to securing to the creditor exactly what he bargained for '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN

90	281	In Dodd Properties v Canterbury City Council -LSB- 1980 -RSB- 1 WLR 433 , Megaw LJ , commenting on the `` general rule '' to which Lord Wilberforce had referred in the Miliangos case , said , at 451 , that it was `` clear '' that the general rule was `` subject to many exceptions and qualifications '' .

90	282	In County Personnel Ltd v.

'' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	283	In Lavarack v. Woods of Colchester Ltd -LSB- 1967 -RSB- 1 QB 278 , the Court of Appeal held that damages for wrongful dismissal could not confer on an employee extra benefits that the contract did not oblige the employer to confer and Diplock LJ -LRB- as he then was -RRB- said at 294 , that : This passage was cited and applied by Waller LJ in giving his judgment , concurred in by Roch and Ward LJJ , in North Sea Energy Holdings NV v. Petroleum Authority of Thailand -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 1 Lloyd 's Rep 483 at 494/5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	284	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	285	The assessment at the date of breach rule is particularly apt to cater for cases where a contract for the sale of goods in respect of which there is a market has been repudiated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	286	The loss caused by the breach to the seller or the buyer , as the case may be , can be measured by the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of the breach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	287	The seller can re-sell his goods in the market . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	288	The buyer can buy substitute goods in the market . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	289	Thereby the loss caused by the breach can be fixed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	290	But even here some period must usually be allowed to enable the necessary arrangements for the substitute sale or purchase to be made -LRB- see e.g. Kaines v. Österreichische -LSB- 1993 -RSB- 2 Lloyd 's Rep 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	291	The relevant market price for the purpose of assessing the quantum of the recoverable loss will be the market price at the expiration of that period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	292	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	293	In cases , however , where the contract for sale of goods is not simply a contract for a one-off sale , but is a contract for the supply of goods over some specified period , the application of the general rule may not be in the least apt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	294	Take the case of a three year contract for the supply of goods and a repudiatory breach of the contract at the end of the first year . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	295	The breach is accepted and damages are claimed but before the assessment of the damages an event occurs that , if it had occurred while the contract was still on foot , would have been a frustrating event terminating the contract , e.g. legislation prohibiting any sale of the goods . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	296	The contractual benefit of which the victim of the breach of contract had been deprived by the breach would not have extended beyond the date of the frustrating event . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	297	So on what principled basis could the victim claim compensation attributable to a loss of contractual benefit after that date ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	298	Any rule that required damages attributable to that period to be paid would be inconsistent with the overriding compensatory principle on which awards of contractual damages ought to be based . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	299	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	300	The same would , in my opinion , be true of any anticipatory breach the acceptance of which had terminated an executory contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	301	The contractual benefit for the loss of which the victim of the breach can seek compensation can not escape the uncertainties of the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	302	If , at the time the assessment of damages takes place , there were nothing to suggest that the expected benefit of the executory contract would not , if the contract had remained on foot , have duly accrued , then the quantum of damages would be unaffected by uncertainties that would be no more than conceptual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	303	If there were a real possibility that an event would happen terminating the contract , or in some way reducing the contractual benefit to which the damages claimant would , if the contract had remained on foot , have become entitled , then the quantum of damages might need , in order to reflect the extent of the chance that that possibility might materialize , to be reduced proportionately . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	304	The lodestar is that the damages should represent the value of the contractual benefits of which the claimant had been deprived by the breach of contract , no less but also no more . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	305	But if a terminating event had happened , speculation would not be needed , an estimate of the extent of the chance of such a happening would no longer be necessary and , in relation to the period during which the contract would have remained executory had it not been for the terminating event , it would be apparent that the earlier anticipatory breach of contract had deprived the victim of the breach of nothing .

90	306	In the Bwllfa case -LSB- 1903 -RSB- AC 426 , Lord Halsbury at 429 rejected the proposition that `` because you could not arrive at the true sum when the notice was given , you should shut your eyes to the true sum now you do know it , because you could not have guessed it then '' and Lord Robertson said at 432 , that `` estimate and conjecture are superseded by facts as the proper media concludendi '' and , at 433 , that `` as in this instance facts are available , they are not to be shut out '' .

90	309	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	310	My noble and learned friend Lord Bingham , in what has been rightly described as a strong dissent , has referred -LRB- in para 9 -RRB- to the overriding compensatory principle that the injured party is entitled to such damages as will put him in the same financial position as if the contract had been performed . 	lord scott	lord bingham	partagr	0.5	NAN
90	311	On the facts of the present case , however , the contract contained clause 33 and would not have required any performance by the Charterers after March 2003 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	312	It should follow that , in principle , the owners , the injured party , are not entitled to any damages in respect of the period thereafter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	313	As at the date of the Owners ' acceptance of the Charterers ' repudiation of the charterparty , the proposition that what at that date the Owners had lost was a charterparty with slightly less than four years to run requires qualification . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	314	The charterparty contained clause 33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	315	The Owners had lost a charterparty which contained a provision that would enable the Charterers to terminate the charterparty if a certain event happened . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	316	The event did happen . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	317	It happened before the damages had been assessed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	318	It was accepted in argument before your Lordships that the Owners ' charterparty rights would not , in practice , have been marketable for a capital sum . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	319	The contractual benefit of the charterparty to the Owners , the benefit of which they were deprived by the repudiatory breach , was the right to receive the hire rate during the currency of the charterparty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	320	The termination of the charterparty under clause 33 would necessarily have brought to an end that right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	321	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	322	The arguments of the Owners offend the compensatory principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	323	They are seeking compensation exceeding the value of the contractual benefits of which they were deprived . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	324	Their case requires the assessor to speculate about what might happen over the period 17 December 2001 to 6 December 2005 regarding the occurrence of a clause 33 event and to shut his eyes to the actual happening of a clause 33 event in March 2003 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	325	The argued justification for thus offending the compensatory principle is that priority should be given to the so-called principle of certainty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	326	My Lords there is , in my opinion , no such principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	327	Certainty is a desideratum and a very important one , particularly in commercial contracts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	328	But it is not a principle and must give way to principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	329	Otherwise incoherence of principle is the likely result . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	330	The achievement of certainty in relation to commercial contracts depends , I would suggest , on firm and settled principles of the law of contract rather than on the tailoring of principle in order to frustrate tactics of delay to which many litigants in many areas of litigation are wont to resort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	331	Be that as it may , the compensatory principle that must underlie awards of contractual damages is , in my opinion , clear and requires the appeal in the case to be dismissed . 	lord scott	self	outcome	0.5	NAN

90	336	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	337	I have had the privilege of reading in draft the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill . 	lord walker	lord bingham	ackn	0.5	NAN
90	338	His opinion clearly sets out the principles of law applicable in this area , including the importance of certainty in commercial transactions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
90	339	His survey of the authorities demonstrates , to my mind conclusively , the essential uniformity of reported decisions on charterparties and similar commercial contracts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	340	In particular , none of the judgments in The Mihalis Angelos -LSB- 1971 -RSB- 1 QB 164 supports the respondents ' case -LRB- Megaw LJ was not expressing a minority view , although he expressed his view more plainly than Lord Denning MR and Edmund-Davies LJ -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	341	The decision of Mustill J in The Wave -LSB- 1981 -RSB- 1 Lloyd 's Rep 521 was entirely orthodox . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	342	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	343	The decision of Timothy Walker J in The Seaflower -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 2 Lloyd 's Rep 37 was rather less clear , but -LRB- in agreement with Lord Bingham -RRB- I consider that the judge took a view of the facts as they were at 30 December 1997 -LRB- the date of the charterers ' notice of termination which was held to be unjustified -RRB- although he did -LRB- at p 44 -RRB- refer to later events as a confirmation of what was inevitable on 30 December 1997 . 	lord walker	lord bingham	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	344	In that case , at p 44 , Timothy Walker J seems to have drawn a distinction between what was `` inevitable '' and what was `` predestined '' -LRB- the expression used by Megaw LJ in The Mihalis Angelos at p 210 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	345	The word `` predestined '' carries theological implications -LRB- a point made by the arbitrator in para 52 of his second declaratory award -RRB- but I agree with the arbitrator that Megaw LJ must have been using the word metaphorically . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	346	He can not possibly have meant anything other than `` inevitable '' , in the sense of an event which is predictable with total confidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	347	In that case the vessel was still unloading in Hong Kong on 17 July 1965 and on that date it was simply impossible that she should be in Haiphong , ready to load , three days later . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	348	Timothy Walker J instructed himself -LRB- following Lord Denning MR in The Mihalis Angelos at p 196 -RRB- that he should `` take into account all contingencies which might have reduced or extinguished the loss , '' but he then correctly concluded that there was , at 30 December 1997 , only one possible outcome . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	349	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	350	Cases concerned with the assessment of damages in tort for personal injuries are in a quite different category . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	351	They are not concerned with economic loss as between traders operating in the marketplace , but with assessing monetary compensation -LRB- so far as money can ever provide compensation -RRB- for bodily injuries whose long-term effects may be very difficult to predict . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	352	In those cases -LRB- and especially in cases of very serious injury -RRB- it is well understood that the final assessment of damages should be made only on the basis of full and up to date medical evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	353	That does not bear on the assessment of damages for breach of a commercial contract in cases where there is an available market . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	354	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	355	For all the reasons given by Lord Bingham I would allow the appeal , and I am not sure that I can usefully say more . 	lord walker	lord bingham	fullagr	0.6	NAN
90	355	For all the reasons given by Lord Bingham I would allow the appeal , and I am not sure that I can usefully say more . 	lord walker	self	outcome	0.6	NAN
90	356	I would simply add that this seems to me to be a case in which a new point , not in either party 's mind at -LRB- or soon after -RRB- the date of breach , has taken on a life of its own as the litigation has been prolonged , both at first instance and on appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	357	This appears from the full and clear findings of fact made by the arbitrator -LRB- Mr Robert Gaisford -RRB- , including his findings about later negotiations which the charterers relied on in alleging that the owners had failed to mitigate their loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	358	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	359	These matters are covered in the early paragraphs of Lord Bingham 's opinion but I draw attention to some salient dates . 	lord walker	lord bingham	partagr	0.6	NAN
90	360	The repudiation by redelivery occurred on 14 December 2001 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	361	The original dispute between the parties was as to the effect of a memorandum of agreement dated 17 July 1998 -LRB- a few days after the charterparty -RRB- which provided for the charterers to have an option for a charter back to the owners ' parent company . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	362	This dispute -LRB- arising out of subsequent changes in the structure of the owners ' corporate group -RRB- went to arbitration , resulting in a first declaratory award dated 16 September 2002 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	363	This declared that the earliest date on which the vessel could have been redelivered under the charterparty was 6 December 2005 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	364	The charterers appealed from that award to the Commercial Court , in which Morison J dismissed the appeal on 17 January 2003 -LRB- -LSB- 2003 -RSB- 2 Lloyd 's Rep 572 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	365	There were then negotiations between the parties -LRB- described in detail in paras 7-16 of the second declaratory award -RRB- as to the charterers accepting redelivery of the vessel on the same terms -LRB- with an amendment not relating to the war clause -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	366	But on 9 January 2003 -LRB- when Morison J was still considering his judgment -RRB- Mr Martin Benny , acting on behalf of the owners , realised the significance of the war clause -LRB- clause 33 of the charterparty -RRB- , if included -LRB- in its amended form -RRB- in the proposed new charterparty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	367	The arbitrator described this as follows -LRB- para 8 -RRB- : 44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	368	The outcome was that the owners rejected an offer which the charterers made on 7 February 2003 -LRB- after Morison J had delivered judgment -RRB- and the negotiations broke down -LRB- but that did not , as the arbitrator held , amount to a failure on the part of the owners to mitigate their loss -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	369	So the possible significance of the war clause was first raised by the owners , in the context of the proposed new charter , more than a year after the original repudiation , and at a time when the prospect of war in the Gulf was emerging as a real threat -LRB- hostilities began on 20 March 2003 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	370	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	371	The arbitrator made a finding of fact -LRB- para 59 -RRB- that at 17 December 2001 a reasonably well-informed person would have considered war or large-scale hostilities between the United States -LRB- and/or the United Kingdom -RRB- and Iraq as `` merely a possibility . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	372	I do not read that as meaning `` less than a 50 % prospect . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	373	The whole thrust of the arbitrator 's findings , after hearing a good deal of evidence , is that it was at the date of repudiation the sort of outside possibility which would , in the commercial world , be severely discounted -LRB- or even entirely disregarded -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	374	That is strikingly confirmed , I think , by the fact that the war clause does not seem to have received even a passing mention in the first part of the arbitration and the consequent appeal to the Commercial Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	375	The issue in those proceedings was of course different ; but if the charterers had seen the war clause as even a potentially live issue , their lawyers could have been expected to put down a marker as to the need to qualify the arbitrator 's unequivocal declaration , upheld in the Commercial Court , that the earliest date for redelivery would have been 6 December 2005 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	376	46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	377	In my opinion the arbitrator erred only in not following his own instinct -LRB- para 56 -RRB- towards the owners ' `` more orthodox '' approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	378	He concluded , wrongly in my view , that The Seaflower required him to look at later events as a guide to what was inevitable , rather than looking at the position -LRB- and weighing contingencies in an appropriate case -RRB- as at the date of breach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	379	In this case an objective and well-informed observer , looking at the matter in December 2001 , would have thought , not only that the prospect of the war clause option becoming exercisable was not inevitable -LRB- in the sense of being predictable with confidence equal , or closely approximating , to 100 % -RRB- but that it was a mere possibility carrying little or no weight in commercial terms .

90	399	He found against the charterers on the issue of liability by an interim declaratory award given on 16 September 2002 , an appeal from which was dismissed by Morison J , sitting in the Queen 's Bench Division -LRB- Commercial Court -RRB- , on 17 January 2003 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
90	400	52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	401	The parties then entered into the issue of damages and asked the arbitrator to determine three further preliminary issues , of which the question before the House was one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	402	Following the dismissal of their appeal on liability , the respondents had made an offer to take the vessel back on charter and entered into negotiations on the measure of damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	403	When the appellants appreciated that it was apparent that the charter would be terminated under clause 33 of the charterparty on the outbreak of war , which was then increasingly likely to happen , they declined to accept the offer except on terms that excluded clause 33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	404	The arbitrator held that the appellants did not by their refusal to accept the offer made by the respondents fail to mitigate their loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	405	53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	406	The arbitrator then focused on the issue which is now before the House , whether the outbreak of the second Gulf War on 20 March 2003 placed a temporal limit on the period in respect of which damages fell to be awarded for the breach of the terms of the charterparty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	407	It was not in dispute , and was so found by the arbitrator , that there was an available market for the chartering of such vessels as the Golden Victory , though the appellants claimed that a new fixture could only have commenced earning , following negotiation , on 1 April 2002 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	408	The appellants ' contention , which they have maintained throughout the sequence of appeals , was that the proper measure of damages was the basic hire which they would have received until the earliest contractual date of termination on 6 December 2005 , plus the profit share to which they would , but for the breach , have become entitled in that period , less the amounts which the vessel could have earned in the available market . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	409	The respondents claimed , on the other hand , that the damages should run only until the outbreak of the war , when they would , as the arbitrator found , have cancelled the charter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN

90	411	The arbitrator received evidence from experts of opposing views as to the likelihood , seen in December 2001 , of the occurrence of war between the United States and Iraq . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	412	He concluded in paragraph 59 of the reasons given for his second declaratory award made on 27 October 2004 : He considered the parties ' contentions about the period for calculation of the damages and his conclusion , following , not without some reluctance , the decision in BS & N Ltd -LRB- BVI -RRB- v Micado Shipping -LRB- Malta -RRB- -LRB- The Seaflower -RRB- -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 2 Lloyd 's Rep 37 , was that the respondents ' contention was correct and that the outbreak of war in March 2003 placed a temporal limit on the damages , none being recoverable for the period from 20 March 2003 onwards .

90	418	Lord Mance , with whose judgment the other members of the court agreed , also declined to accept the appellants ' argument based on The Mihalis Angelos and the emphasis placed by their counsel on the paramountcy of certainty and finality in charter transactions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN

90	420	Damages for breach of contract are a compensation to the claimant for the loss of his bargain : McGregor on Damages , 17th ed , -LRB- 2003 -RRB- , para 2-002 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	421	He is entitled to be placed , as far as money can do it , in the position which he would have occupied if the contract had been performed : Sally Wertheim v Chicoutini Pulp Co -LSB- 1911 -RSB- AC 301 , 307 , per Lord Atkinson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	422	They should ordinarily be assessed as at the date when the cause of action arose , that is to say , the date of breach : see Chitty on Contracts , 29th ed -LRB- 2004 -RRB- , vol 1 , para 26-057 ; and cf Johnson v Agnew -LSB- 1980 -RSB- AC 367 , 400-1 , per Lord Wilberforce and the other cases cited by my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill in paragraph 11 of his opinion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	423	The basic rule in the case of repudiation of a charterparty , where there is an available market , is that the loss is measured as at the date of acceptance of the repudiation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	424	The calculation is made on the basis that the injured party can mitigate his loss by going into the market and obtaining a replacement charter as soon as reasonably possible on the best terms available for the balance of the charter period : see Koch Marine Inc v D'Amica Società di Navigazione ARL -LRB- The Elena D'Amico -RRB- , per Robert Goff J. His loss will then be calculated by reference to the extent to which he is worse off in consequence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	425	This will normally be the extra cost of chartering a substitute vessel , if the owner has repudiated the original charter , and any reduction in charter rates if the repudiation was by the charterer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN

90	427	58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	428	At the centre of the appellants ' printed case and the persuasive oral argument presented to the House by their counsel Mr Hamblen QC was the proposition that in commercial transactions such as shipping charters the pre-eminent requirement is for certainty , finality and ease of settlement of disputes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	429	There are many judicial statements , going back to Lord Mansfield CJ in Vallejo v Wheeler -LRB- 1774 -RRB- 1 Cowp 143 , underlining the high importance of certainty in commercial transactions , a number of which have been cited by Lord Bingham in paragraph 23 of his opinion . 	lord carswell	lord bingham	partagr	0.7	NAN
90	430	I do not propose to set these out again , since the principle is so well known and established . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	431	Mr Hamblen took as his starting point the rule that where there is an available market the loss is measured at -LRB- or close to -RRB- the date of acceptance of the repudiation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	432	Applying to that the requirement of certainty , he reasoned that events subsequent to that date are irrelevant in the assessment of the damages , since the loss is crystallised at the date of repudiation and an arbitrator or court should not look at such events in making the assessment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	433	The only exception to this rule was where the subsequent event could be seen at the crystallisation date to be inevitable or `` predestined '' -LRB- the term used by Megaw LJ in The Mihalos Angelos , to which I shall return -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	434	In such a case , but not otherwise , it could be shown that at that date the effect of the events which were inevitably going to take place had rendered less valuable the contractual rights lost by the injured party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	435	59 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	436	Mr Young QC for the respondents submitted that whereas the appellants ' proposition might be regarded as sound in respect of the rate at which the loss is to be calculated , it was incorrect in respect of the duration of that loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	437	He drew that distinction because on the occurrence of the repudiation the injured party has the opportunity to mitigate his loss by going into the market and making new arrangements as soon as reasonably possible , so that at that point the loss becomes crystallised and one can calculate it over the remainder of the charter period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	438	Where there is a suspensive condition such as a war clause , however , the duration of the charter was always uncertain , depending on a contingency of the occurrence of an event which was by definition within the contemplation of the parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	439	As Lord Mance said in the Court of Appeal -LRB- para 23 -RRB- , the charter always had inherent in it the uncertainty involved in the war clause . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	440	60 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	441	The cases cited by Lord Bingham in paragraphs 15 to 17 of his opinion are in complete accord with the principle of measuring the loss at a date as near as practicable to the acceptance of the repudiation . 	lord carswell	lord bingham	partagr	0.7	NAN
90	442	In none of these cases was there any suspensive condition which might come into operation , and they each reaffirm the standard rule of crystallisation , which is undoubtedly correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	443	The issue before the House arises where such a condition may affect the duration of the charter but it can not be forecast with any certainty whether or when it will operate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	444	Mr Hamblen recognised that an exception may be allowed to permit the occurrence of certain subsequent events to affect the calculation of the injured party 's loss , but he argued that the ambit of the exception is limited in the manner which I have set out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	445	In so submitting he relied strongly on a statement by Megaw LJ in The Mihalos Angelos , a decision to which I must now turn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	446	61 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	447	Lord Bingham has set out the facts and issues in that case in some detail in paragraph 14 of his opinion and I gratefully adopt his account to avoid unnecessary repetition . 	lord carswell	lord bingham	factagr	0.7	NAN
90	448	The passage from Megaw LJ 's judgment on which Mr Hamblen relies is at page 210 : It is in my opinion important to read this statement in the context of the case which the Court of Appeal was deciding . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	449	It was completely certain , or predestined , that the contingency on which the charterers were entitled to cancel the contract would occur , since it was physically impossible for the ship to reach Haiphong by 20 July , the date on which she was to be ready to load at that port and the date on which the charterers could cancel if she was not so ready . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	450	Megaw LJ 's statement was entirely correct , for the event was predestined to happen and the consequence which he set out in the passage which I have quoted had to be regarded as following . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	451	It might be doubted whether Megaw LJ intended to enunciate a general rule limiting consideration of subsequent events to those predestined to happen , seen from the date of acceptance of repudiation , and it may be observed that neither Lord Denning MR nor Edmund Davies LJ went so far as to tie the consideration of subsequent events to those which could be seen at the date of repudiation as certain to happen . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	452	If , however , the meaning to be taken from Megaw LJ 's statement is that only events predestined to happen will qualify to bring the exception into operation , then I must decline to accept that as correct , for the reasons which I shall set out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	453	62 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	454	The decision in The Seaflower has some similarity to that in The Mihalos Angelos . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	455	Lord Bingham has set out the facts of this case in paragraph 19 , and again I would adopt them and need not repeat them . 	lord carswell	lord bingham	factagr	0.7	NAN
90	456	Timothy Walker J found that it was inevitable that the charter would have come to an end on 26 February 1998 , since the Mobil approval could not have been regained by that date and the charterers would have been entitled to cancel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	457	He said specifically at page 44 of the report that he must follow the view expressed by the majority of the court in The Mihalos Angelos and that he could see no reason why in the case before him `` the approach should be constrained in the way suggested by Lord Justice Megaw '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	458	He went on in the next sentence : It appears accordingly that the judge did not hold that it could be said at the date of repudiation that it was inevitable or predestined that the owners would be unable to regain the Mobil approval , which was necessary if the charterers were not to have the right to cancel on that date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	459	It became inevitable at some later date , but it was not so found at the date of repudiation -LRB- although no doubt it was highly likely -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	460	If it had been , one would have expected the judge to hold that on either test the damages were limited to the period up to 27 February 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	461	The arbitrator considered , I think rightly , that Timothy Walker J in The Seaflower took the view which I have attributed to him and that the supervening event was capable of limiting the measure of damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
90	462	63 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	463	The point at issue in this appeal has never been considered by your Lordships ' House and remains open for decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	464	Lord Bingham has placed strong emphasis in paragraph 23 of his opinion on the importance of certainty in commercial transactions . 	lord carswell	lord bingham	partagr	0.8	NAN
90	465	I do not wish to cast any doubt upon that , but I have come to the conclusion that Langley J and the Court of Appeal were right in holding that the contingency of the outbreak of war , which had occurred before the damages fell to be considered in the arbitration , could be taken into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	466	I find myself in agreement with Lord Mance when he said that considerations of certainty and finality have in this case to yield to the greater importance of achieving an accurate assessment of the damages based on the loss actually incurred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	467	64 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	468	The duration of the charter may in a case such as the present be affected by the contingency of the occurrence of an event which is in the contemplation of the parties and catered for in the terms of the charterparty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	469	While the rate at which the hypothetical new charter is arranged on repudiation of the original one is for good reasons taken to be fixed at the time when the injured party could go into the market to negotiate a replacement , the same considerations do not apply to determination of the duration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	470	The damages can be assessed at the date of repudiation by valuing the chance that the contingency would occur and that the charter would be cancelled , an approach accepted by Lord Mance at paragraph 23 of his judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	471	That value might lie anywhere on the scale between extreme unlikelihood , which would give the deduction a minimal value , to virtual certainty , which would mean that it would be assessed at a figure very close to that which would be reached if one made the definite assumption that the contingency would occur . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	472	This approach is well known and recognised in other areas of the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	473	It is commonplace in the assessment of damages for personal injuries to award a sum which reflects the chance that a condition such as osteoarthritis may set in . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	474	A clear example of the technique may be found in Kitchen v Royal Air Force Association -LSB- 1958 -RSB- 1 WLR 563 , where in a claim against solicitors for damages for professional negligence in failing to bring an action on for trial the court awarded the plaintiff a sum representing her prospects of success in the action , being a proportion of the damages which she would have received if one could have been certain that it would have been successful : see also the abundant examples discussed in McGregor on Damages , 17th ed -LRB- 2003 -RRB- , paras 8-024 et seq. 65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	475	This is where the principle exemplified by Bwllfa and Merthyr Dare Steam Collieries -LRB- 1891 -RRB- Ltd v Pontypridd Waterworks Co -LSB- 1903 -RSB- AC 426 operates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	476	The respondent waterworks company in that case exercised its statutory power by notice dated 15 October 1898 to prevent the appellant colliery company from proceeding with its intention to work a seam of coal , notified by the appellant in September 1898 under section 22 of the Waterworks Clauses Act 1847 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	477	The coal in the protected area would have been reached in or about June 1900 and would have been worked out in about two years from that date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	478	The appellant sought statutory compensation for this loss and the matter went to an arbitration , which concluded in February 1901 , the arbitrator giving his award on 26 April 1901 in the form of a special case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	479	The issue between the parties was whether the compensation was to be assessed , not on the basis of the value of coalfield or the coal in question in October 1898 , but on the basis of the amount which the appellant could have made from mining the coal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	480	The House rejected the respondent 's contention that the coal should have been valued as if on a sale at the date of the appellant 's notice in October 1898 and accepted that the proper basis was the profit which the appellant could have made from mining the coal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	481	That being so , if the arbitration had been held soon after October 1898 , the arbitrator could have calculated that by estimating the possible rise or fall in the price of coal over the period in which it would have been mined . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	482	As it was not held until a later date , he had available up-to-date evidence of the rise in price over the period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	483	It was held that it was wrong to require him to disregard this , for , as Lord Macnaghten said in characteristic style at page 431 : 66 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	484	If the second Gulf War had not broken out by the time the arbitration was held , the arbitrator would have had to estimate the prospect that it might do so and factor into his calculation of the appellants ' loss the chance that the charter would be cancelled at some future date under Clause 33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	485	The loss which would have been sustained over the full period of the charter would then have been discounted to an extent which would have reflected the chance , estimated at the time of the assessment , that it would be so terminated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	486	As events happened , however , the arbitrator did not come to assess damages until after the outbreak of war , when , as he found , the respondents would have cancelled the charter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	487	The outbreak of the second Gulf War was then an accomplished fact , which was highly relevant to the amount of damages , and in my opinion the arbitrator was correct to take it into account in assessing the appellants ' loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	488	As Lord Robertson put it in the Bwllfa case at page 432 , `` estimate and conjecture are superseded by facts . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	489	A striking example of the artificiality of failing to have regard to this principle may be seen in paragraph 84 of the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood . 	lord carswell	lord brown	partagr	0.8	NAN
90	490	67 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	491	Two features relating to this conclusion are worthy of mention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	492	First , it is a necessary assumption in estimating the damages that the hypothetical new charterparty taken to have been negotiated by the appellants in early 2002 would have contained terms which corresponded as closely as possible to those of the original charterparty , including the cancellation provision in Clause 33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	493	Mr Hamblen accepted in argument that one should regard it as containing such a clause and Lord Mance recorded in paragraph 27 of his judgment that the court was told that bilateral war clauses were invariable in time charters for tankers likely to visit the Gulf . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	494	Secondly , Mr Hamblen expressed concern that repudiating parties in future cases might attempt to delay the assessment of damages in order to see if such a suspensive condition might come into operation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	495	I recognise that a risk of that nature may exist , but courts and arbitrators have the ability to prevent such abuse if application is made to them to proceed with dispatch . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	496	68 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	497	For these reasons and also for those contained in the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Scott of Foscote and Lord Brown , I agree with the conclusion reached by Langley J and the Court of Appeal and would dismiss the appeal . 	lord carswell	lord scott	fullagr	0.8	NAN

90	502	The basic facts of this case could hardly be simpler . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	503	On 17 December 2001 the appellant owners accepted the respondent charterers ' repudiation of a charterparty which nominally still had nearly four years to run -- to 6 December 2005 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	504	I say `` nominally '' because by clause 33 of the charterparty the charterers were entitled to cancel it in the event of war or hostilities breaking out between any two or more of a number of countries including the USA , the UK and Iraq . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	505	On 20 March 2003 , such a war -LRB- the Second Gulf War , hereafter ` the War ' -RRB- did indeed break out and the arbitrator has found as a fact that the charterers would in any event then have cancelled the charterparty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	506	70 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	507	Indisputably the owners are entitled to damages for having been deprived of the value of this charterparty for the fifteen months or so up to the outbreak of the War . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	508	Are they , however , entitled , as they claim , to be compensated on the basis that the charterparty would have continued for the whole length of its nominal term ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	509	71 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	510	The owners advance their argument by reference to the familiar principle that damages for breach of contract ordinarily fall to be assessed as at the date of the breach -LRB- the breach date rule as it was called in argument -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	511	They submit that that principle is applicable here and that the assessment of damages must accordingly ignore the outbreak of the War . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	512	That , it is argued , is a subsequent event of no relevance to the proper assessment of the owner 's loss in December 2001 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	513	Indeed , even had there existed in December 2001 a very substantial risk of imminent war in the Gulf , the owner 's principal argument would require it to be ignored : only if it could be shown that by that date war was inevitable -- `` pre-destined to happen '' in the words of Megaw LJ in The Mihalis Angelos -LSB- 1971 -RSB- 1 QB 164 -LRB- in the passage cited by my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill at para 14 -RRB- -- could it be brought into account to ensure that `` the damages which -LSB- the owners -RSB- can recover are not more than the true value , if any , of the rights which -LSB- they have -RSB- lost , having regard to those pre-destined events '' -LRB- again the words of Megaw LJ in the same passage -RRB- . 	lord brown	lord bingham	partagr	0.8	NAN
90	514	The charterers submit to the contrary that , whilst certainly -LRB- given the availability of a market for the vessel 's period chartering -RRB- the breach date rule would operate in this case to fix the daily net differential base charter rate , it should not determine either the period for which that loss was suffered or the date for assessing that period .

90	516	A single issue has been formulated by the parties for your Lordships ' determination on the appeal : 73 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	517	It is convenient at this point to notice the way this issue was dealt with by the arbitrator in his Second Declaratory Arbitration Award . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	518	His main conclusion -- to which he felt reluctantly driven by Timothy Walker J 's decision in The Seaflower -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 2 Lloyd 's Rep 37 -- was that the outbreak of war `` did place a temporal limit on the recoverability of damages ... and that no damages are recoverable for the period from 21 March 2003 onwards .

90	519	But his award considered also what the position would have been if -LRB- contrary to his main conclusion -RRB- damages had had to be assessed as at December 2001 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	520	The owners -LRB- relying on The Mihalis Angelos -RRB- argued that in that event the charterers would have had to show that as at that date war was inevitable ; the charterers submitted to the contrary that all they would have needed to establish was that war was probable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	521	Expert evidence on this issue was adduced respectively from a professor of peace studies and a professor of war studies , one saying that war had been inevitable , the other -LRB- as recorded in para 35 of the award -RRB- that `` its level of probability was not above 50 % , as of mid-December 2001 . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	522	The arbitrator expressed his conclusion at para 59 : 74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
90	523	Having regard to his main conclusion , of course , this secondary issue was not in any event capable of influencing the result : that was to be determined by the known outcome of events , not some notional earlier forecast . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	524	It seems to me , however , important to consider its implications . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	525	There was in this charterparty -LRB- as my noble and learned friend Lord Carswell points out at para 59 of his opinion -RRB- a suspensive condition , clause 33 , recognised by the parties to be capable of bringing this contract to a premature end . 	lord brown	lord carswell	partagr	0.9	NAN
90	526	Could it really be the position that only were cancellation under clause 33 inevitable could it properly be brought into account in calculating the value of this repudiated contract ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	527	What , indeed , in this context does inevitability connote ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	528	At what point in the remaining four years of the nominal term of this charterparty did its premature cancellation have to be inevitable ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	529	It would be one thing if war were adjudged likely to have broken out within a month , quite another if that was not to be for a further three years -- and so forth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	530	For my part , I have found The Mihalis Angelos of little assistance on this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	531	The position that arose there could hardly have been more different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	532	It concerned a single voyage charterparty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	533	Once it was recognised that the charterers would have been bound in any event to have cancelled the charterparty before ever it took effect , the owners could establish no loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	534	It was an all or nothing case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	535	The voyage either would or would not have taken place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	536	Not so here : the question rather was whether and if so when the charterparty would have been ended under clause 33 before the completion of its nominal term . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	537	Even had war not broken out by the time damages came to be assessed I can see no reason why that question should not have been addressed in the conventional way , i.e. by making the best possible assessment of the likely course of future events as at the date of assessment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	538	As Lord Denning MR said in The Mihalis Angelos , at p 196 : `` You must take into account all contingencies which might have reduced or extinguished the loss . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	539	It was hardly a novel proposition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	540	75 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	541	I realise , of course , that I have yet to address the central question arising for your Lordships ' decision : the date by reference to which the overall damages assessment falls to be made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	542	It seems to me , however , essential first to appreciate just what is the exercise the tribunal assessing damages would be embarking upon . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	543	76 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	544	Not only do I reject the owners ' contention that the tribunal would be concerned with contingencies only if , at the relevant date , they were inevitable , but I reject too the charterers ' concession , apparently implicit in their competing submission to the arbitrator , that only contingencies which are probable need be brought into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	545	It seems to me that before the arbitrator everyone was mesmerised by The Mihalis Angelos , a case which , as I have already suggested , affords very little assistance in the very different circumstances arising here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	546	And , indeed , despite their apparent approval of Megaw LJ 's formulation of the test in The Mihalis Angelos , I understand both Lord Bingham and my noble and learned friend Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe to accept that account should properly be taken of a contingency which would reduce the value of the contract lost even were the chance of it happening less than 50 % -LRB- provided always that it was of some real and not just minimal significance -RRB- -- see particularly para 22 of Lord Bingham 's opinion and para 46 of Lord Walker 's . 	lord brown	lord bingham	partagr	0.9	NAN
90	546	And , indeed , despite their apparent approval of Megaw LJ 's formulation of the test in The Mihalis Angelos , I understand both Lord Bingham and my noble and learned friend Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe to accept that account should properly be taken of a contingency which would reduce the value of the contract lost even were the chance of it happening less than 50 % -LRB- provided always that it was of some real and not just minimal significance -RRB- -- see particularly para 22 of Lord Bingham 's opinion and para 46 of Lord Walker 's . 	lord brown	lord walker	partagr	0.9	NAN
90	547	77 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	548	In this connection I respectfully disagree with Lord Walker 's interpretation -LRB- in para 45 of his opinion -RRB- of the arbitrator 's findings . 	lord brown	lord walker	fulldisa	0.9	NAN
90	549	Unlike him , I understand the arbitrator 's characterisation -LRB- in para 59 of his award -RRB- of the prospect of war as at 17 December 2001 as `` merely a possibility '' to mean precisely `` less than a 50 % prospect . '' 	lord brown	lord walker	fulldisa	0.9	NAN
90	550	On the arguments addressed to him , the only issue was whether the correct test was one of probability or inevitability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	551	Once he decided on the facts that neither of those tests was satisfied here , it was unnecessary for him to say more . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	552	The expression `` merely a possibility '' was used simply in contradistinction to both the rival situations being contended for , probability and inevitability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	553	Para 59 was , indeed , an acceptance of Professor Freedman 's view , expressed at para 35 , `` that war was clearly neither pre-destined nor inevitable and , indeed , its level of probability was not above 50 % , as of mid-December 2001 . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	554	Not even Professor Freedman was suggesting that the prospect of war was only an outside possibility , of no real significance whatever . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	555	His evidence was no more extreme than that the prospect `` was not above 50 % . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	556	Assuming this were so , whether the prospect was 5 % or 45 % was , on the arguments addressed to the arbitrator , immaterial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	557	78 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	558	In the end , I should add , nothing to my mind turns on this difference between Lord Walker and myself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	559	My more fundamental conclusion , as I shall shortly explain , is that the breach date rule does not require contingencies -- such as the likely effect of a suspensive condition -- to be judged prior to the date when damages finally come to be assessed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	560	All I am presently concerned to demonstrate is that , whatever the appropriate date by reference to which the assessment must be made , the taking into account of a contingency is likely to be an altogether more complex exercise than it was in The Mihalis Angelos and that it will not generally be possible , as it was there , simply to decide one way or the other -LRB- in that case it mattered not whether at the point of breach or later -RRB- whether or not the whole contract was inevitably doomed to fail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	561	The point is sufficiently made if the arbitrator here might have found , say , a 30 % or 40 % prospect of war as at December 2001 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	562	The next question would have been : war when ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	563	Could it really be thought in the interests of certainty to address these questions as of some date prior to that on which damages are in fact being assessed ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	564	To my mind , not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	565	Must the judge really shut his eyes to the known facts and speculate how matters might have looked at some earlier date ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	566	Again , not without compelling reason and none appears to me . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	567	Lord Bingham -LRB- at para 12 -RRB- and Lord Carswell -LRB- at para 65 -RRB- have already explained the `` Bwllfa principle '' : Bwllfa & Merthyr Dare Steam Collieries -LRB- 1891 -RRB- Ltd v Pontypridd Waterworks Co -LSB- 1903 -RSB- AC 426 . 	lord brown	lord bingham	partagr	0.9	NAN

90	568	There is no need to repeat it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	569	Suffice it to say that I see no good reason to depart from it here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	570	79 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	571	It is time finally to address the breach date rule directly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	572	Its most obvious manifestation is to be found in section 51 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Sale of Goods Act 1893 : But the rule is by no means confined to the sale of goods context and , as Lord Bingham explains , has been applied by analogy to a variety of other situations . 	lord brown	lord bingham	partagr	0.9	NAN
90	573	Essentially it applies whenever there is an available market for whatever has been lost and its explanation is that the injured party should ordinarily go out into that market to make a substitute contract to mitigate -LRB- and generally thereby crystallise -RRB- his loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	574	Market prices move , both up and down . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	575	If the injured party delays unjustifiably in re-entering the market , he does so at his own risk : future speculation is to his account -- `` the buyer 's decision is -LRB- in the vernacular -RRB- down to him '' -LRB- Bingham LJ , as he then was , in Kaines -LRB- UK -RRB- Ltd v Osterreichische -LSB- 1993 -RSB- 2 Lloyd 's Reports 1 , 11 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	576	80 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	577	The rule is easy to apply where , for example , goods or shares are traded : if it is the seller who is injured by non-acceptance , he must as soon as possible re-sell the goods or shares at the then available market price ; if the buyer , he must similarly buy in substitute goods or shares . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	578	But undoubtedly the rule can be applied in more complex situations , for example , to building or repairing contracts and , most relevantly for present purposes , to breached charterparties -- see particularly The Mihalis Angelos , The Elena d'Amico -LSB- 1980 -RSB- 1 Lloyd 's Rep 75 , The Wave -LSB- 1981 -RSB- 1 Lloyd 's Rep 521 , The Noel Bay -LSB- 1989 -RSB- 1 Lloyd 's Rep 361 and The Seaflower -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 2 Lloyd 's Rep 37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	579	Where goods or shares are sold , the breach date rule is at its strictest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	580	In other cases , however , time may well be needed before the injured party can reasonably be required to re-enter the market . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	581	Radford v De Froberville -LSB- 1977 -RSB- 1 WLR 1262 concerned a defendant 's contractual failure to build a wall on the plaintiff 's land . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	582	In a much quoted judgment Oliver J at p 1285 said this : Or take Dodd Properties -LRB- Kent -RRB- Ltd v Canterbury City Council -LSB- 1981 -RSB- 1 WLR 433 , a case of contractual liability for serious structural damage , where Megaw LJ -LRB- at p 451 -RRB- said this : A little later , Megaw LJ -LRB- at p 453 -RRB- added : 81 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	583	Take , indeed , this very case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	584	Whilst it was not disputed before the arbitrator that an available market existed for the chartering of this vessel , the owners contend that a new fixture could only have commenced earning on 1 April 2002 and in the result claim for loss on the spot -LRB- rather than the period charter -RRB- market for the three and a half months between 17 December 2001 and 1 April 2002 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
90	585	In this case , as in Dodd Properties , therefore , account must necessarily be taken of post-breach events . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	586	Why then ignore the outbreak of the War ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	587	Say that this had started a year earlier , on 20 March 2002 , before a substitute charterparty could have commenced earning ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	588	Would the damages assessment really have had to ignore it ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	589	Nor , indeed , is the lapse of some three and a half months before a substitute charterparty could have commenced earning the only , or even the main , post-breach event necessarily to be taken into account here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	590	As my Lords have observed , the rate of hire of the Golden Victory consisted only partly of the base charter rate ; it consisted also of a share in the charterers ' operating profit over and above that rate and this latter element of the claimed loss , as Lord Mance pointed out , would require any court or arbitrator to take account of actual market rates during the relevant period over which the loss is claimed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	591	Yet on the owners ' argument that part of the claim too would continue throughout the remaining four years of this charterparty , the intervention of the War notwithstanding . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	592	82 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	593	None of the earlier charterparty cases to my mind addresses or determines the particular problem arising here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	594	In none of them , as Lord Carswell has observed , was there a suspensive condition which could -LRB- and which we know in the event would -RRB- have operated to bring the contract to an early end . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	595	Any substitute contract here -- albeit , as the arbitrator found , for the 4 year balance of the original 7 year term -- would have been subject to the self-same conditions as the repudiated contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	596	And it can be assumed that the hypothetical substitute charterers would similarly have cancelled their contract on the outbreak of the War . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	597	The arbitrator surmised that had the owners in December 2001 sold the vessel with a substitute 4 year charter `` the value they would have received would surely have been calculated on that basis '' i.e. the basis of a 4 year charterparty with war `` no more than a possibility . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	598	Even were that so , however , no one has ever suggested that the breach date rule operated here so as to require the owners to go out into the market not only to obtain a substitute charter but also then to sell the vessel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	599	The measure of loss did not fall to be crystallised on this basis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	600	83 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	601	In my opinion the owners ' argument here seeks to extend the effect of the available market rule well beyond its proper scope and to do so , moreover , at the plain expense of Lord Blackburn 's fundamental principle : to restore the injured party to the same position he would have been in but for the breach , not substantially to improve upon it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	602	It is one thing to say that the injured party , mitigating his loss as the breach date rule requires him to do , thereby takes any future market movement out of the equation and to that extent crystallises the measure of his loss ; it is quite another to say , as the owners do here , that it requires the arbitrator or court when finally determining the damages to ignore subsequent events -LRB- save where the defendants can demonstrate that at the date of breach some suspensive condition would inevitably -- and immediately -- have operated to cancel the contract -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	603	There is no warrant for giving the rule so extended an application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	604	84 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	605	There is a final point to be made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	606	Shift the facts here and assume that the arbitrator had found , as at December 2001 , a probability -LRB- or even merely a significant possibility -RRB- of -LRB- perhaps imminent -RRB- war breaking out in the Gulf , but that in fact , by the time damages finally came to be assessed , not only had war not broken out but all risk of it had disappeared -- or , indeed , the assessment might not have taken place until the whole nominal term of the charterparty had expired . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	607	On the view taken by the minority of your Lordships , the damages award would have had to reflect a risk which never in fact eventuated , a conclusion in the circumstances , greatly to the owner 's disadvantage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	608	Yet that inescapably is the logic of the minority 's approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	609	Is such a result compelled in the interests of `` certainty '' or `` finality '' or `` consistency '' or `` predictability '' -LRB- the interests identified by Lord Bingham at para 23 of his opinion -RRB- , or so that the charterers could have `` promptly honoured their secondary obligation to pay damages '' -LRB- Lord Bingham at para 22 -RRB- ? 	lord brown	lord bingham	partagr	1	NAN
90	610	In my judgment it is not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	611	When market movement can be eliminated from the assessment of damages -LRB- as here with regard to the charterparty rate -RRB- it should be -LRB- by the breach date rule -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	612	But not history ; the Court need not shut its mind to that . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	613	85 .	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
90	614	In short , I find myself in full agreement with the judgments of Langley J at first instance in the Commercial Court and Lord Mance in the Court of Appeal , and the opinions of Lord Scott of Foscote and Lord Carswell in your Lordships House.
