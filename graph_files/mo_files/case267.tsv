267	7	LORD MACKAY OF CLASHFERN 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord mackay
267	8	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord mackay
267	9	This appeal is concerned with a dispute between the appellant whom I shall refer to as `` the father '' and the respondent whom I shall refer to as `` the mother '' relating to the name to be given to their child whom I shall refer to as `` Alexander . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord mackay
267	10	It is an appeal by leave of your Lordships ' House given on 23 July 1998 from the decision of the Court of Appeal -LRB- Hirst and Thorpe L.JJ . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord mackay
267	11	which on 31 July 1997 allowed the mother 's appeal from the order of His Honour Judge Cotterill in the Taunton County Court made on 14 January 1997 in which he had ordered that the child , Alexander , should be known as Alexander Guy Dawson -- Dawson being the father 's surname -- and that the mother be prohibited from causing or permitting Alexander to be known by any other name . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord mackay
267	12	The facts may be summarised as follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord mackay
267	13	Prior to her meeting the father , the mother had been married to Tony Wearmouth by whom she had two children , a daughter Danielle Wearmouth born on 10 May 1986 and a son Ben Kenward Wearmouth born on 22 April 1988 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord mackay
267	14	The mother and her husband separated in June 1993 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	15	Their marriage was subsequently dissolved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	16	The mother has at all times continued to use and be called by the surname Wearmouth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	17	The children of her marriage have at all times continued to live with the mother and to be called by the surname Wearmouth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	18	In about June 1994 , and after her marriage had been dissolved , the mother began a relationship with the father . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	19	They began living together at the mother 's council house in Somerset , initially at weekends , in about September 1994 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	20	They bought and moved into their own house in the West Midlands in April 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	21	They moved back to Somerset in February 1996 to a house which they had purchased and where the father continues to live . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	22	They never married . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	23	Alexander was born on 26 March 1996 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	24	On 15 April 1996 the mother left the father taking all three children with her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	25	On 26 April 1996 the mother made an application against the father for an `` ouster '' injunction which was dismissed following a two day hearing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	26	On 15 May 1996 the father gave voluntary `` non-molestation '' undertakings but the mother declined to move back to live with him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	27	Since then the mother has looked after Alexander and the two children of her former marriage , living in council accommodation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	28	On 19 April 1996 the mother without consulting the father registered Alexander 's name in accordance with the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953 as amended , which I shall refer to as `` the 1953 Act , '' as Alexander Guy Wearmouth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	29	The father became aware of this a few days later . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	30	Prior to Alexander 's birth the father and the mother had discussions about the name of their child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	31	The mother was aware of the father 's wish that the child should be named Alexander David Bolden Dawson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	32	She said that she agreed only that he should be called Alexander ; the father said that she agreed to the full name but changed her mind after they had separated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	33	That issue has not been resolved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	34	The Act of 1953 requires registration within 42 days of the birth of a child and where the parents are married the duty lies on both the father and the mother of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	35	What the parents must furnish to the Registrar are such particulars concerning the birth as may be required by regulations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	36	The regulations are the Registration of Births and Deaths Regulations 1987 -LRB- Statutory Instrument 1987 No. 2088 -RRB- as amended by the Registration of Births and Deaths -LRB- Amendment -RRB- Regulations 1994 -LRB- Statutory Instrument No. 1948 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	37	Amongst the particulars required are the name and surname of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	38	Regulation 9 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1987 Regulations provides : `` With respect to space 2 -LRB- name and surname -RRB- - -LRB- a -RRB- if a name is not given , the registrar shall enter only the surname , preceded by a horizontal line ; -LRB- b -RRB- the surname to be entered shall be the surname by which at the date of the registration of the birth it is intended that the child shall be known . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	39	In the case of a child whose father and mother were not married to each other at the time of his birth , the duty to register the birth is upon the mother alone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mackay
267	40	Furthermore section 10 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1953 not only relieves the father of a duty to give information but prohibits the registrar from entering in space 4 of Form 1 the name of any person as father of the child except as provided in the circumstances defined in the following lettered paragraphs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	41	By paragraph 6 of Schedule 12 to the Children Act 1989 , `` the 1989 Act , '' for the final lettered paragraph d was substituted more extensively paragraphs d to g . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	42	The circumstances defined in paragraphs a to f all require the mother 's co-operation and consent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	43	Therefore where her co-operation and consent is absent the registrar shall not enter the name of any person as father of the child in the register save where there is in force any of the orders defined in paragraph g and sub-section -LRB- 1A -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	44	None of these orders was in force in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	45	On 13 May 1996 , the father issued an application at Taunton County Court in relation to Alexander seeking : 1 -RRB- a contact order under section 8 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1989 ; 2 -RRB- a parental responsibility order under the Act of 1989 sections 2 -LRB- 2 -RRB- ,3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- ; and 3 -RRB- a specific issue order as to Alexander 's name under section 8 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1989 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	46	The father 's case was set out in statements made by the father on 17 September 1996 and 6 January 1997 and by his father on 10 December 1996 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	47	The mother 's case was set out in statements made by the mother on 2 January 1997 and by her sister on 13 January 1997 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	48	The Court Welfare Officer 's report dated 18 December 1996 stated : `` In respect of Mr. Dawson 's application to have the child 's surname changed to his , I would see -LSB- sic -RSB- that at this stage his surname would have no impact on the welfare of the child , and is more an issue which is in the realms of case law . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	49	Because of the wider issues raised by the father 's applications for a contact order and a parental responsibility order , the proceedings took a considerable time to come before the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	50	On 14 January 1997 His Honour Judge Cotterill made orders : -LRB- i -RRB- by consent that Alexander have visiting contact to and with the father fortnightly on Sunday afternoons ; -LRB- ii -RRB- that the father should have parental responsibility for Alexander ; and -LRB- iii -RRB- that Alexander should be known as Alexander Guy Dawson and that the mother be prohibited from causing or permitting Alexander to be known by any other name . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	51	In deciding to make the order relating to Alexander 's surname the judge said : `` It seems to me that I must approach this question of how he should be named as though the matter had come before me at the time when the birth was to be registered and before the question had been resolved , because otherwise Mr. Dawson falls foul of the law 's delay rather than of his own acquiescence in a state of affairs of which he never for one moment approved . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	52	Having stated that he must approach the question of the child 's surname as though the matter had come before him at the time when the birth was to be registered and before the question had been resolved he gave reasons for his judgment which can be summarised as follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	53	The name of a child is not a trivial matter but an important matter , and is not a question to be resolved without regard to the child 's welfare . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	54	For this purpose it was necessary to consider the welfare checklist in section 1 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Act of 1989 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	55	Whilst the mother is much more comfortable with Alexander being called Wearmouth rather than Dawson and while it is understandable she would be irritated , though not distressed , were she be required to use the name Dawson in relation to Alexander there was no suggestion that any such reaction was likely to be so extreme as to affect adversely her ability to bring Alexander up properly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	56	The proposition that it is generally in a child 's interest to have the same name as his mother when she is bringing up the child alone was rejected and he also rejected the proposition that a difference of names between children in the same household would embarrass or adversely affect either the mother or the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	57	He also rejected the suggestion that other children in the family might be unkind , if not downright cruel , to Alexander if he bore a different surname . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	58	He also rejected any convention that the child should bear the father 's name . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	59	Alexander 's awareness of his status as the mother 's son could never be in question as he would be in her day-to-day care although his awareness of being his father 's child was likely to be maintained by contact ; how that contact would develop , and what changes and circumstances in the future might affect things , could only be a matter of conjecture . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	60	Alexander 's interest is best served in his having the reminder of his father 's place in his life by his bearing his father 's name . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	61	He concluded that it was in Alexander 's best interest that he be known by the name Dawson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	62	He considered that his conclusion was reinforced by the authorities emphasising the importance of paternity and the child 's right to know who his father is and the possibility that the mother might find a new partner , adopt his name and give that name to any children they had . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	63	On appeal to the Court of Appeal the submission that the court had no jurisdiction to deal with the matter at all was rejected but the court held that His Honour Judge Cotterill had erred in principle in exercising his discretion so that it was incumbent upon the Court of Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	64	Counsel for the mother had submitted that there was a fundamental error of principle in the judge 's decision to approach the question as though the matter had been heard before the registration of Alexander 's birth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	65	Counsel for the father accepted that this was going somewhat too far and suggested that it would have been more appropriate for the judge to say that he had put the registration on one side or words to that effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	66	The court observed that as a matter of principle , registration is a profound matter and consequently a major factor to be taken into account in the exercise of the court 's discretion and one which it is totally inappropriate for the court to put on one side as of no more than marginal significance , let alone to disregard it entirely . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mackay
267	67	The court concluded that the name Wearmouth was the mother 's actual name at the time it was chosen by her as well as being that of Alexander 's half-brother and half-sister . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	68	It was therefore a perfectly natural and logical choice for her to make and could not in their view be justly criticised as alien merely because it is also the name of the mother 's ex-husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	69	These circumstances , coupled with the all-important fact already stressed that this was the child 's duly registered name seemed to the Court of Appeal to be very powerful factors in the mother 's favour which can only be displaced by strong countervailing considerations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	70	They found no such strong countervailing considerations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	71	In considering the submission made by counsel for the mother that the court had no jurisdiction to make an order such as the learned County Court Judge had made the Court of Appeal considered the submission that this matter could be dealt with only under section 13 of the Act of 1989 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	72	Section 13 so far as relevant provides : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- Where a residence order is in force with respect to a child , no person may - -LRB- a -RRB- cause the child to be known by a new surname without either the written consent of every person who has parental responsibility for the child or the leave of the court . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	73	This submission for the mother rested largely on the judgment of the Court of Appeal in In re B. -LRB- Change of Surname -RRB- -LSB- 1996 -RSB- 1 F.L.R. 791 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	74	In that case the mother sought to change the surname of the three children of the family from that of her divorced husband to that of the husband whom she had subsequently married . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	75	Her application for leave was refused by the circuit judge and the Court of Appeal -LRB- Stuart-Smith L.J. and Wilson J. -RRB- upheld his refusal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	76	Counsel for the father had sought to argue that the application was for a specific issue order under section 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	77	The Court of Appeal in the present case interposed that it might be assumed that the underlying strategy was then to advance the argument that , since the determination of a section 8 application was subject to the section 1 -LRB- 3 -RRB- checklist , the views of the three children aged between 17 and 12 were almost decisive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	78	However , the submission was rejected by Mr. Justice Wilson , in an opinion with which Stuart-Smith L.J. agreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	79	The Court of Appeal in the present case concluded that that ruling might well be apt in any case where a residence order is in force with respect of a child whose name the application seeks to change but that this is an apt example of an area in which the court has power to make a specific issue order so long as no residence order is in force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	80	They accordingly concluded that the court had jurisdiction to make the section 8 order if it was thought to be appropriate in the circumstances of the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	81	Against this decision no appeal is taken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	82	The court went on to say that whether that jurisdiction should be exercised is another matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	83	They concluded as I have said that if there is a general principle underlying this appeal it is that the registration of change of a child 's surname is a profound and not a merely formal issue whatever the age of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	84	Any dispute on such an issue must be referred to the court for determination whether or not there is a residence order in force and whoever has or has not parental responsibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	85	No disputed registration or change should be made unilaterally . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	86	On the facts of this case the mother , they said , was not in breach of that principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	87	From this passage in the Court of Appeal 's judgment I take it they were saying that at the stage of registration in the circumstances of this case the mother had a duty to register the child with the surname by which at that time she intended that the child should be known . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	88	It is common ground that the father had neither power nor duty to intervene in the registration process . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	89	The Court of Appeal 's ultimate decision may be summarized by saying that in order to justify an order requiring a change of name , considerations relative to the child 's welfare will have to be advanced for that purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	90	The name chosen and registered was the mother 's actual surname at the time as well as being that of Alexander 's half-brother and half-sister . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	91	It was therefore a perfectly natural and logical choice to make and to justify making an order for changing that name strong countervailing considerations would be required . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	92	The only one really suggested was that a change to the father 's name would assist in maintaining Alexander 's connection with him and emphasise his paternal connection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mackay
267	93	They point out that this would apply in virtually every case to an illegitimate child where the father seeks to play some role in the child 's life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	94	In the circumstances they concluded that there was no justification for ordering an alteration in the child 's name particularly as his first name was that chosen by the father . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	95	Counsel for the father submitted that the Court of Appeal had given far too much emphasis to the registration , that while a period of usage of a name might justify making it difficult to order a change , there was no such usage in the present case and that it would be positively in the interest of the welfare of the child to have the surname which linked the child with his father and thus helped to maintain that relationship which would be beneficial for his welfare . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	96	A number of cases were cited to us in which the importance of a change of name and in which the aspect of connection with the child 's father were emphasised but in these cases the change sought by the mother was normally from a surname which was the father 's established by usage , to a name which was either that of another man or her own . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	97	The facts of this case distinguish it from these as there is no suggestion of any substantial usage and ultimately the right course , in my opinion , must be to apply the criteria in section 1 of the Act of 1989 including section 1 -LRB- 5 -RRB- and not make an order for the change of name unless there is some evidence that this would lead to an improvement from the point of view of the welfare of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	98	In this connection the Welfare Officer 's conclusion , to which I have already referred , is relevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	99	The application of section 1 so long as they take account of the criteria there in question is a matter within the discretion of the Court of Appeal and I can see no ground for suggesting that they have erred in principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	100	The heavy emphasis on the registration is , I think , a reflection of the fact that they considered that the judge had wrongly left that out of account and that the application must be understood as for a change from a name already registered and therefore that in the light of section 1 of the Children Act some circumstances required to be pointed to which would justify making that change in the interest of the child 's welfare . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	101	In fairness to the Court of Appeal it must be pointed out that , although they described the fact that the name sought to be changed was the duly registered name as all-important , they coupled that with the circumstances that the name Wearmouth was the mother 's actual name at the time it was chosen by her , as well as being that of Alexander 's half-brother and half-sister , in stating their view that their discretion should be exercised against the making of the order for change . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	102	Counsel for the father also referred to the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights and suggested that , in the light of the decision of the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg in the case of Keegan v. Ireland -LRB- 1994 -RRB- 18 E.H.R.R. 342 , 362 , if the provisions of the system for the registration of births and the emphasis of the Court of Appeal in the present case on registration were taken together , this deprived the father of his rights in terms of article 8 of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	103	In my opinion on a fair reading of the decision of the Court of Appeal they were suggesting not that the registration was conclusive of the issue in the present case but that in order to justify changing the name from that which was registered circumstances justifying the change would be required and they concluded in the exercise of their discretion that there were no such circumstances of sufficient strength to do so in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	104	In that situation , in my opinion , the argument on the Convention has no separate validity from the earlier arguments for counsel for the father to which I have referred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	105	This is a difficult and narrow case but on a fair reading of the judgment of the Court of Appeal as a whole , I am satisfied that they correctly applied the provisions of the Children Act and in particular section 1 in the exercise of their discretion to refuse to make an order for change of name in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	106	For these reasons I would dismiss this appeal . 	lord mackay	self	outcome	0.4	lord mackay
267	107	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	108	LORD JAUNCEY OF TULLICHETTLE 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	109	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	110	The speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern , which I have had the advantage of reading in draft , sets out the factual and legislative background of this appeal which account I gratefully adopt . 	lord jauncey	lord mackay	ackn	0.4	lord mackay
267	110	The speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern , which I have had the advantage of reading in draft , sets out the factual and legislative background of this appeal which account I gratefully adopt . 	lord jauncey	lord mackay	factagr	0.4	lord mackay
267	111	It is , therefore , unnecessary for me to say more than that the appeal arises out of an application by a father for a Specific Issue Order under section 8 of The Children Act 1989 requiring that his son should be known by his name . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	112	The researches of counsel revealed some sixteen reported decisions involving change of a child 's surname since 1963 , in thirteen of which the child 's surname had been registered as that of the father and in two of which it had been registered as the maiden name of the mother . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	113	In the remaining case -LRB- D. v. B. -LSB- 1979 -RSB- Fam . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	114	38 -RRB- a child conceived during wedlock was registered in the surname of another man with whom the mother had gone to live shortly before its birth , although the husband was declared by her to be the father . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	115	In the present case , the child who was illegitimate was born in 1996 and registered in the name of the mother 's former husband from whom she has been permanently separated since 1993 with no reference in the register to the appellant , his natural father . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	116	The child has accordingly no connection either biological or directly familial with the man whose surname he bears . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	117	The father 's wish that his son should bear his surname rather than that of this man is understandable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	118	The child has after all not a drop of Wearmouth blood in his veins . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	119	The aforesaid lack of biological connection does not of itself determine whether the child 's surname should be changed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mackay
267	120	In determining whether a Specific Issue Order should be made under section 8 the court must consider the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration -LRB- section 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	121	The Court of Appeal having determined that the judge , in making the order , had erred in principle in putting the fact of registration to one side exercised their discretion afresh and refused to make the order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	122	I understand that your Lordships have had little difficulty in concluding that the Court of Appeal exercised their discretion according to correct principles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	123	Unfortunately , I have not found the matter so easy and while I do not feel justified in formally dissenting from those views I wish to comment on two matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	124	The Court of Appeal expressed the view that as a matter of principle registration of a birth is a profound matter and a major factor to be taken into account in the exercise of the court 's discretion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	125	I do not dissent from the proposition that it is a factor to be taken into account but I do not accept that it is necessarily a major factor in every case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	126	When a child has for a number of years been known by its registered name , where it is aware of that name and where , for example , it has been entered at school or on the list of a General Practitioner by that name no doubt the fact of such registration will be an important factor in the exercise of discretion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	127	However where the child , as in this case , was of such an age as to be incapable of understanding the significance of its registered surname , registration as a factor must assume very much less importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	128	The weight to be attached to the fact of registration in an application to change a child 's name must always depend upon the surrounding circumstances as they affect the welfare of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	129	Before the Court of Appeal counsel for the father argued that the mother had chosen not her maiden name but one which signified a factually incorrect nexus between the child and her ex-husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	130	Common sense favoured the name of the father with whom the child was connected rather than the mother 's ex-husband with whom he was not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	131	This argument was rejected as substantially flawed inasmuch as the name Wearmouth was that of the mother and the child 's half-siblings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	132	While this is no doubt a factor to be taken into account I do not consider that it justifies outright rejection of the argument which , had I been called upon to exercise my discretion , I should certainly have treated as meriting consideration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	133	A surname which is given to a child at birth is not simply a name plucked out of the air . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	134	Where the parents are married the child will normally be given the surname or patronymic of the father thereby demonstrating its relationship to him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	135	The surname is thus a biological label which tells the world at large that the blood of the name flows in its veins . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	136	To suggest that a surname is unimportant because it may be changed at any time by deed poll when the child has obtained more mature years ignores the importance of initially applying an appropriate label to that child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	137	The importance of a child bearing its father 's name has been emphasised on many occasions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	138	In In re T. -LRB- orse . H -RRB- -LRB- An Infant -RRB- -LSB- 1963 -RSB- Ch . 238 , a case where a mother had by deed poll changed the paternal surname of her daughter by her first husband to that of her second husband , Buckley J. said , at p. 242 : `` In the case of a divided family of this sort it is always one of the aims of the court to maintain the child 's contact , respect and affection with and for both of its parents so far as the circumstances will permit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	139	But to deprive the child of her father 's surname , in my judgment , is something which is not in the best interests of the child because , I think , it is injurious to the link between the father and the child to suggest to the child that there is some reason why it is desirable that she should be called by some name other than her father 's name . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	140	In In re W. G. -LRB- 1976 -RRB- 6 Fam.Law 210 , where the facts were similar to those in In re T. -LRB- supra -RRB- , Cairns L.J. giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal said that : `` it should be realised that the mere fact that there had been a divorce , that the mother had remarried and had custody of the child , and had a name different from that of the child , was not a sufficient reason for changing the child 's surname . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	141	The courts recognised the importance of maintaining a link with the father , unless he had ceased to have an interest in the child or there were some grounds -- having regard to his character and behaviour -- which made it undesirable for him to have access to the child at all . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	142	In L. v. F. , The Times , 31 July 1978 Latey J. , after referring to having heard the evidence of a distinguished child psychiatrist to the effect that `` when they grew older , children were often greatly concerned with their biological origin '' stated that : `` Today divorce was commonplace . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	143	The fact that the children 's surname was different from that of the mother and their half-sister would not cause embarrassment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	144	The children would have a better sense of security if there was cooperation between the parents and the step-father . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	145	In that case the child was living en famille with its mother , stepfather and half-sister but the mother 's application to change the child 's surname was refused . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mackay
267	146	In the present case , as I have pointed out , there never has been a step-father . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mackay
267	147	In W. v. A. -LRB- Minor : Surname -RRB- -LSB- 1981 -RSB- Fam . 14 , where the facts were similar to those of the three previous cases , Dunn L.J. , in refusing the mother 's application , referred with approval to L. v. F. and In re W. G. , and at p. 21B included the importance of maintaining the child 's links with the paternal family as one of the factors to be considered by the judge in an application by a mother for change of a child 's patronymic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mackay
267	148	The above-mentioned cases involved a change from an entirely appropriate registered surname to one allegedly rendered more appropriate as a result of supervening circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mackay
267	149	In the present case it is the registered surname which is said to be inappropriate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mackay
267	150	My Lords I accept , of course , as the authorities make clear , that the changing of a child 's surname is a matter of importance and that in determining whether or not a change should take place the court must first and foremost have regard to the welfare of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mackay
267	151	There are many factors which must be taken into account , not only those pertaining to the present situation but also those which are likely to affect the child in the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mackay
267	152	Just as the fact that the mother happens to bear a different surname from the child is not a sufficient reason for changing the child 's surname -LRB- In re W. G. -LRB- supra -RRB- , In re C. -LRB- Change of Surname -RRB- -LSB- 1998 -RSB- 2 F.L.R. 656 -RRB- so the fact that mother and child bear the same name should not necessarily be sufficient reason for refusing a change if there are valid countervailing reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mackay
267	153	Where an illegitimate child has been registered in the name of the separated husband of a young mother instead of the father I consider that any court adjudicating upon an application by the father for a change of its surname should have regard not only to the importance of maintaining a paternal link as expounded in the cases above-mentioned but should consider the very real possibility that the mother might re-marry and doubtless take her husband 's surname . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mackay
267	154	Furthermore the probability that the child when older may be interested in his biological origin and wonder why it bears a name which is neither that of its mother nor of its father but rather that of a man with whom it has no connection and whom it may never have seen is a further factor to be considered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mackay
267	155	Is it necessarily in the best interests of the child that it may in the future be clothed with a patronymic with which it has no connection of any kind and so present itself to the world ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mackay
267	156	I am left in doubt as to whether the Court of Appeal gave proper weight to these important matters in exercising their discretion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mackay

267	167	On 13 May 1996 Mr. Mark Dawson made three applications under the Children Act 1989 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mackay
267	168	They all related to the child Alexander born on the 26th of March 1996 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mackay
267	169	He asked for a Contact Order , a Parental Responsibility Order , and a Specific Issues Order as to the name of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mackay
267	170	It was accepted by the mother of the child , Dawn Wearmouth , that Mr. Dawson was the natural father of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mackay
267	171	It was agreed that a Parental Responsibility Order should be made in his favour and a Contact Order in satisfactory terms was also agreed and approved by the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mackay
267	172	The point remaining in contention was whether or not a Specific Issues Order should be made regarding the surname which should be used by the mother for the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mackay
267	173	The mother and father were not married at any time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	174	The mother therefore was , until the Parental Responsibility Order was made , the person having the sole parental responsibility for the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	175	It was her sole duty to register the birth of the child under the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	176	She did so within the 42 days permitted by the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	177	She was required , among other things , to register `` the surname by which at the date of the registration of the birth it is intended that the child shall be known . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	178	It was at that time her intention that the surname by which the child shall be known was Wearmouth which was the name that she herself was using at that time and was the name used also by her two other young children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	179	The application of the father was that the wife should be required to use the surname Dawson being his own name . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	180	On 14 January 1997 , after a contested hearing at which both the father and the mother were represented and at which documentary evidence was placed before the court , the County Court Judge , His Honour Judge Cotterill , ordered that the mother henceforth use the name Dawson as the child 's surname . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	181	The mother appealed to the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	182	The Court of Appeal -LRB- Hirst and Thorpe L.JJ -RRB- held that the County Court Judge had not properly exercised his discretion in accordance with the terms of the Children Act and exercised their own discretion to set aside his order and make no order on the application for a Specific Issues Order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	183	With the leave of Your Lordships ' House , the father has appealed to this House asking that the Judge 's order be reinstated or , in the alternative , that the Court of Appeal 's exercise of the discretion be set aside and the application remitted to the Family Division . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	184	The application made by the father was both in form and substance an application made under section 8 of the Children Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	185	No residence order had been made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	186	The child has throughout its life been residing with the mother . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	187	No point arises under section 13 of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	188	The criteria to be applied by the court in deciding whether or not to make a specific issue order are those laid down in section 1 of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	189	They require the court to take as the paramount consideration the child 's welfare . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	190	A court has to have regard in particular to the seven points listed in subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- , the ` check list ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	191	Subsection -LRB- 5 -RRB- further provides that the court shall refrain from making an order `` unless it considers that doing so would be better for the child than making no order at all . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	192	It was the duty of both the County Court Judge and the Court of Appeal to apply these criteria . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	193	Both courts purported to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	194	The question raised by the present appeal is how the court should take into account the fact that at the time of the making of the application and the exercise of the discretion the child had already been registered with the surname which was currently being used for the child albeit that the child was still only an infant and had no awareness of any such matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	195	It has often been observed that the use of surnames is among the questions which give rise to the most deeply felt disputes between parents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	196	As in other areas , the parents are liable to see the question raised as reflecting upon their own rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	197	It is clear from the arguments which have been advanced in the courts below and even to some extent Your Lordships ' House that the father and mother see the present dispute largely in such terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	198	They are mistaken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord mackay
267	199	Once the dispute has arisen , the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	200	The attitude and views of the individual parents are only relevant in so far as they may affect the conduct of those persons and therefore indirectly affect the welfare of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	201	However , the question in the present case comes before the court at a time when the mother has already performed her sole duty -LRB- and right -RRB- of choosing a surname for the child and having that surname entered in the Register of Births . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	202	That fact is part of the existing circumstances which represent the status quo and provide an important part of the background against which the court has to assess what will be in the interests of the child 's welfare . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	203	The court can not change the registration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	204	It can only make a section 8 order requiring the mother to use a different name from that which has been registered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	205	This fact also governs the procedural position under the Children Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	206	The mother having registered the child and having commenced to use the registered surname , it is necessary for the father to apply to the court under section 4 for an order granting him parental responsibility and under section 8 for a Specific Issue Order requiring the mother to use a different surname . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	207	The father then has to make out a positive case in accordance with section 1 of the Act that it is in the interests of the child that the order should be made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	208	If he fails to make out that positive case , his application will fail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	209	The County Court Judge saw the case in a rather different light . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	210	His approach can be summarised in the following quotation : `` It seems to me that I must approach this question of how he should be named as though the matter had come before me at the time when the birth was to be registered and before the question had been resolved , because otherwise Mr. Dawson falls foul of the law 's delay rather than of his own acquiesence in a state of affairs of which he never for one moment approved . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	211	The Judge therefore wholly disregarded the fact that the mother had registered the birth of the child with the surname Wearmouth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	212	He was clearly in error in so doing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	213	The registered surname of a child is relevant and , indeed , no precedent has been cited to your Lordships of the making of an order under section 8 -LRB- or any other relevant power -RRB- which required the use of a surname which was not the registered surname . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	214	The County Court Judge was obviously wrongly influenced by the idea that the mother had in some way violated the father 's rights in registering the birth of the child as she did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	215	As earlier observed the mother was simply carrying out her statutory duty and correctly communicating her intentions to the Registrar . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	216	The Court of Appeal were right to take the view that they should exercise the relevant discretion afresh . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	217	There is ample material in the present case which supports the conclusion that the status quo represents the best interests of the child at present or , at least , shows that the arguments in favour of and against making the order are no better than equally balanced and that therefore an order should not be made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	218	The father has pointed out that it is well recognised that the use of the father 's surname helps to support the relationship between the child and his or her father and that in many cases applications by a mother for a change of the child 's surname to her own have failed on this ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	219	The father also points out that the mother sometime in the future may cease to use the name Wearmouth either because she remarries or because she chooses to revert to her maiden name . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	220	Wearmouth is not her maiden name : it is the name of her former husband who is the father of her two other children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	221	If the child is known by the surname Dawson that will give him a clear link to his father as well as publicly recognising his paternity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	222	On the other hand it is submitted that the name Wearmouth is a convenient and suitable name having regard to the welfare of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	223	The relationship between the father and the mother had broken down with acrimony shortly after the birth of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	224	The child was left in the sole care of the mother along with his two half-brothers who were also known as Wearmouth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	225	The mother was and is using the name Wearmouth and there is no evidence of any intention on her part to cease doing so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mackay
267	226	As regards the child 's relationship with his father , the father has regular access to the child which will continue until either the father no longer wishes to avail himself of it or some other circumstance concerning the welfare of the child inter venes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	227	This is not a case where the child has ever used the father 's surname nor is it a case where the continued use of that surname would be necessary to preserve a link with the father . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	228	When one adds to these considerations the fact that the registered surname of the child is Wearmouth and will remain so for the rest of his life , it will be seen that there is an increased argument in favour of not disturbing the status quo . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	229	The name appearing upon a child 's birth certificate is not without importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	230	It has practical implications and , other things being equal , it is in the long term interests of the child that the name by which he is known should also be the name which appears on his birth certificate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	231	The County Court Judge was wrong wholly to disregard this feature of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	232	The terms in which the Court of Appeal have expressed themselves in their Judgment do however present problems as a result of some of the statements made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	233	The Judgment of the Court was divided into two parts the first of which dealt with a jurisdiction dispute which has not been re-opened on this appeal and the second of which dealt with the exercise of the discretion whether or not to make the section 8 order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	234	The Court of Appeal discussed the applicable criteria in the jurisdiction part of their judgment and did not revisit them in the discretion part . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	235	Therefore , it was possible for the father to submit on this appeal that the Court of Appeal had not had adequate regard to or properly applied the relevant criteria . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	236	It was further submitted that the Court of Appeal were over dismissive of the arguments of the father and gave wholly inappropriate weight to the question of registration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	237	The Court of Appeal said : `` These circumstances , coupled with the all-important fact already stressed that this was the child 's duly registered name , seem to us to be very powerful factors in the mother 's favour , which can only be displaced by strong countervailing considerations . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	238	It can be persuasively argued that this statement makes the same kind of error as that made by the Judge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	239	Instead of wholly disregarding the registration aspect -LRB- as did the Judge -RRB- , the Court of Appeal appears to elevate it into an overriding factor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	240	If this were the tenor of the Judgment read as a whole , the exercise of the discretion by the Court of Appeal would not , in my judgment , be able to stand . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	241	The statement that I have quoted goes too far . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	242	The fact of registration is a relevant and , maybe , important factor in assessing where the balance of advantage for the child 's welfare lies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	243	But it is not `` all-important . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	244	Similarly , it does not as such render irrelevant the well recognised considerations which weigh in favour of a child having the same surname as its natural father and does not alter the need for making an overall assessment of where the child 's interests lie . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	245	Therefore , to say that the importance of the registration `` can only be displaced by strong countervailing considerations '' overstates the true position and if used as a criterion in later cases will be liable to distort a proper evaluation of the section 1 criteria . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	246	But in my judgment the Court of Appeal were , on the evidence before them , entitled to take the view that the father had not made out his case that the welfare of this child made it appropriate to order the mother to cease to use the surname Wearmouth for this child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	247	The Court of Appeal were also right to treat as one of the clearly relevant factors the fact that the child 's birth certificate bears the name Wearmouth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	248	The conclusion at which they arrived was in my judgment the appropriate one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	249	Having regard to their judgment as a whole I accept that they did apply the relevant criteria . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	250	However , I must express my disapproval of the way in which they chose to express themselves . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	251	In my judgment courts or judges , faced with a similar situation where an order is being applied for for a change of surname from the registered name to a different name , should take into account the implications of adopting such a course . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mackay
267	252	The Court of Appeal in the present case were right to take it into account as have been the other courts which have followed that decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord mackay
267	253	But it should not be treated as an `` all-important '' factor which requires to be `` displaced by strong countervailing considerations . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord mackay
267	254	Each case depends upon its own facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord mackay
267	255	In any given case all the facts and circumstances relevant to the welfare of the child need to be taken account and weighed up against each other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord mackay
267	256	Whether or not any one factor tips the balance one way or the other will vary from one case to another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord mackay
