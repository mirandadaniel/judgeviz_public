284	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope
284	4	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope
284	5	The issue in this appeal is confined to a single point of statutory construction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope
284	6	It arises out of a series of claims brought by about 60,000 part-time workers under the Equal Pay Act 1970 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope
284	7	They had been denied access to their employers ' occupational pension schemes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope
284	8	This was because the schemes laid down as a condition of membership thresholds as to minimum weekly working hours with which , as part-time workers , they could not comply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope
284	9	Their claims were the subject of a series of test cases under what has been described as the Preston litigation : see Preston and others v Wolverhampton Healthcare N H S Trust and others -LSB- 1998 -RSB- ICR 227 -LRB- HL -RRB- , Preston and others v Wolverhampton Healthcare N H S Trust and others -LRB- Case C-78 / 98 -RRB- -LSB- 2000 -RSB- ICR 961 -LRB- ECJ -RRB- and Preston and others v Wolverhampton Healthcare N H S Trust and others -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- UKHL 5 , -LSB- 2001 -RSB- ICR 217 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
284	10	The first round of cases dealt with a range of preliminary issues of general application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
284	11	The current round which has given rise to this appeal deals with issues which , while not of universal application , affect all or at least the majority of cases within a particular group or sector . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
284	12	Mrs Preston , after whom the litigation takes its name , is no longer involved in these proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
284	13	Her claim was successful before the employment tribunal on the preliminary issue which was relevant to her , and there has been no appeal against that decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
284	14	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
284	15	The appellants ' cases were selected to deal with a particular issue that affects claimants who were transferred from the employment of one employer to another by the operation of the Transfer of Undertakings -LRB- Protection of Employment -RRB- Regulations 1981 -LRB- SI 1981/1794 -RRB- -LRB- `` TUPE '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
284	16	The question that has arisen in their cases relates to the meaning and effect of the statutory time limit on the bringing of claims under the 1970 Act where there has been a TUPE transfer and the claim relates to the operation of an equality clause on an occupational pension scheme . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
284	17	The appellants were all employed in the electricity industry , but the issue is not confined to claimants who were employed in that sector . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
284	18	It applies also to the claims of other persons employed in the private sector , including the banking and local government sectors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
284	19	It is an issue of general public importance as it affects so many claims . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
284	20	In view of the importance of the case the First Secretary of State was given leave to intervene in the appeal , and brief submissions to the effect that it should be dismissed were made on his behalf by counsel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
284	21	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
284	22	Section 2 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the 1970 Act was amended by the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 , section 8 -LRB- 6 -RRB- and Part I , para 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of Schedule 1 , and it has been amended again since the events with which this case is concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
284	23	At the relevant time it provided as follows : 4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
284	24	For reasons that I shall explain more fully later , claims in respect of the operation of an equality clause relating to an occupational pension scheme where there has been a TUPE transfer must be brought against the transferor , not the transferee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
284	25	The time limit affects every claim which depends on facts that occurred prior to the date of the TUPE transfer , and the appellants ' claims are all in that category . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
284	26	The question with which this case is concerned , put simply , is whether time begins to run in a claim against the transferor for equality of treatment under its occupational pension scheme from the date of the transfer , or whether it runs from the end of the employee 's employment with the transferee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
284	27	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
284	28	As a result of the decisions mentioned above , it is common ground that section 2 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the 1970 Act applies to the appellants ' claims . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
284	29	So , if they are to be entertained by an employment tribunal , they must be brought within the statutory time limit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
284	30	It is also common ground that , where a claim is brought in time , the employment tribunal is empowered to declare that a successful applicant has the right of retrospective access to the scheme , subject to the payment of appropriate contributions , in respect of periods of employment not earlier than 8 April 1976 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
284	31	That was the date as from which direct effect was given to the judgment of the European Court of Justice in Defrenne v Sabena -LRB- Case C-262 / 88 -RRB- -LSB- 1976 -RSB- ICR 547 , in which the court ruled that article 119 of the EC Treaty -LRB- now article 141 EC -RRB- could be relied on to claim equal treatment in the right to join an occupational pension scheme . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
284	32	The question as to the meaning and effect of the time limit affects all those claimants in whose cases the facts giving rise to the claim occurred prior to the date of the TUPE transfer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
284	33	The facts 6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
284	34	The appellants were originally employed by an employer within the nationalised electricity industry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
284	35	They all worked part-time in an electricity showroom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
284	36	Prior to 1 April 1988 their working hours were insufficient to qualify them for membership of the occupational pension scheme to which their employers were affiliated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
284	37	This was the industry 's Electricity Supply Pension Scheme -LRB- the `` Scheme '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
284	38	On 1 April 1988 the working hours threshold was removed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
284	39	The appellants then joined the Scheme and began to accrue benefits under it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
284	40	In 1990 the electricity industry was privatised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
284	41	The Scheme was then split into 17 separate Groups , each of which was aligned with the respective privatised businesses and the companies that had been formed to run these businesses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
284	42	As a result each Group within the Scheme became , in effect , a discrete pension scheme . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
284	43	In 1992 a TUPE transfer took place -LRB- in fact there were two successive transfers on successive days , but nothing turns on this -RRB- as a result of which the appellants ' employment was transferred to a new employer , Powerhouse Retail Ltd. 7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
284	44	The appellants ' claims relate entirely to periods prior to 1 April 1988 , except in the case of Mrs Burroughs whose claim relates to the period prior to October 1986 when she became eligible for membership of the Scheme because her working hours had increased . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
284	45	They all relate to periods when the appellants were employed by the transferor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
284	46	The pension benefits which they accrued between 1 April 1988 and the date of the transfer remained with their original employer 's Group for a short period after the transfer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
284	47	They were then transferred to the Powerhouse Retail Group of the Scheme . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
284	48	The effect of the transfer was to align the Group with the appellants ' new employment with the transferee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
284	49	The appellants accept however that the effect of regulation 7 of TUPE is that their claims for retrospective access to the Scheme in respect of periods of employment prior to 1 April 1988 must be made against the transferor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
284	50	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
284	51	The appellants ' originating applications were presented to the employment tribunal in November and December 1994 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
284	52	They had been prompted by the decisions of the European Court of Justice in Vroege v NCIV Instituut voor Volkshuisvesting B V -LRB- Case C-57 / 93 -RRB- and Fisscher v Voorhuis Hengelo BV -LRB- Case C-128 / 93 -RRB- -LSB- 1995 -RSB- ICR 635 , in which the court ruled -LRB- 1 -RRB- that the right to membership of an occupational pension scheme , as well as benefits payable under the scheme , fell within the scope of article 119 of the EC Treaty , -LRB- 2 -RRB- that the exclusion of married women from membership of such a scheme entailed discrimination based on sex , -LRB- 3 -RRB- that the exclusion of part-time workers from membership could amount to a contravention of that article if it affected a much greater number of women than men unless the employer showed that the exclusion was explained by objectively justified factors unrelated to discrimination on the ground of sex and -LRB- 4 -RRB- that the article could be relied on to claim equal treatment in the right to join an occupational pension scheme as from 8 April 1976 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
284	53	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
284	54	The dates when these applications were presented were more than six months after the date of the relevant TUPE transfers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
284	55	The appellants contend that time runs against their claims from the end of their employment with the transferee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
284	56	On this approach , as they were still in the employment of the ultimate transferee employer when their claims were presented , their claims were all in time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
284	57	The respondents , on the other hand , contend that the appellants ' `` employment '' within the meaning of section 2 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the 1970 Act for the purposes of their claims for equal treatment under the occupational pension schemes was their employment with the transferor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
284	58	If this is right , the claims were all out of time , as the appellants ' employment with the transferor ended with the date of the TUPE transfer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
284	59	The Equal Pay Act 1970 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
284	60	The 1970 Act had , as has already been mentioned , been amended by the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 in order to establish the demarcation line between discriminations which were subject to the Equal Pay Act and those which were subject to the Sex Discrimination Act by the date when the European Court of Justice issued its decision in the Defrene v Sabena case on 8 April 1976 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
284	61	The words `` equal pay clause '' in the 1970 Act as originally enacted were replaced by `` equality clause '' to make it clear that discriminations which were subject to the Equal Pay Act related not just to pay but to other terms and conditions of the woman 's contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
284	62	The 1970 Act as amended is set out in Part II of the Schedule to the 1975 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
284	63	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
284	64	In order to set section 2 -LRB- 4 -RRB- into its context , the following provisions in section 1 of the 1970 Act , as amended , should be noted : 12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
284	65	Section 2 of the Act , as amended , provides : The TUPE Regulations 13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
284	66	The Transfer of Undertakings -LRB- Protection of Employment -RRB- Regulations 1981 were made under section 2 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the European Communities Act 1972 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
284	67	They gave effect to Council Directive 77/187/EEC of 14 February 1977 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees ' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings , businesses or parts of businesses -LRB- `` the Acquired Rights Directive '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
284	68	The first indent of article 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Directive provides : Article 3 -LRB- 2 -RRB- provides that after the transfer the transferee shall continue to observe the terms and conditions agreed in any collective agreement until the date of termination or expiry of the agreement or the entry into force or application of another collective agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
284	69	The first indent of article 3 -LRB- 3 -RRB- provides : 14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
284	70	Regulation 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of TUPE provides : Regulation 5 -LRB- 2 -RRB- provides that , on the completion of a relevant transfer : 15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
284	71	Regulation 7 -LRB- 1 -RRB- provides that regulation 5 shall not apply : 16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
284	72	The effect of these provisions is to replace the common law rule that a change in the identity of an employer terminates a contract of employment : Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries -LSB- 1940 -RSB- AC 1014 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
284	73	But the rule which they create that a relevant transfer does not terminate the contract , with the result that all the rights and obligations of the transferor are transferred to the transferee , is subject to the exception set out in regulation 7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
284	74	The transferee does not inherit the pension obligations of the transferor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
284	75	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
284	76	In the employment tribunal , Mr J K Macmillan held that time began to run under section 2 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the 1970 Act from the date of the TUPE transfer , so proceedings had to be brought against the transferor within six months of that date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
284	77	In the employment appeal tribunal , Judge J McMullen QC held that the employment tribunal chairman erred in holding that time began to run from the date of the TUPE transfer : -LSB- 2004 -RSB- ICR 993 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
284	78	In his opinion it did not begin to run until the end of the employee 's employment with the transferee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
284	79	In para 146 of his judgment he said : 18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
284	80	The Court of Appeal -LRB- Pill , Jonathan Parker LJJ and Laddie J -RRB- -LSB- 2004 -RSB- EWCA Civ 1281 allowed the respondents ' appeal against the decision of the employment appeal tribunal : -LSB- 2005 -RSB- ICR 222 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
284	81	In para 25 of his judgment , with which the other members of the court agreed , Pill LJ said that , while the effect of TUPE was that the continuing contract of employment was deemed always to have been with the transferee , it must be acknowledged that the pension rights had been removed from it and that it could not be treated as if they had not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
284	82	He then explained how , as he saw it , this reasoning fits with the wording of section 2 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the 1970 Act : Discussion 19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
284	83	Mr Cavanagh QC for the appellants said that the Court of Appeal were wrong to separate out the contract containing the equality clause relating to the pension rights from the contract with the transferee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
284	84	He said that the effect of regulation 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of TUPE was that the contract with the transferor was not brought to an end on the transfer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
284	85	The same contract continued in existence after that date as a contract with the transferee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
284	86	Regulation 7 had two consequences only : first , the terms of the transferor 's contract relating to the pension rights were not transferred to the transferee ; and second , the transferee had no responsibility to provide a pension for any period before the date of the transfer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
284	87	The liability for claims as to the operation of an equality clause relating to periods before the transfer remained with the transferor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
284	88	But it was going too far to say that , as a side-effect of these provisions , time started to run against the claimant on the date of the transfer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
284	89	It was the contract itself that was transferred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
284	90	So it was the contract itself which identified the claimant 's `` employment '' within the meaning of section 2 -LRB- 4 -RRB- for the purposes of the time limit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
284	91	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
284	92	He sought to find support for this argument in a passage in the speech of Lord Slynn of Hadley in Preston and others v Wolverhampton Healthcare NHS Trust and others -LSB- 1998 -RSB- ICR 227 -LRB- HL -RRB- , 237G-H , where , having noted that there was no provision in the 1970 Act that different contracts of employment are to be treated as continuous employment , Lord Slynn said : 21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
284	93	Mr Cavanagh also submitted that his argument was supported by the fact that the provision in the contract that was relied on in the appellants ' claims was the equality clause . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
284	94	This was a term that was introduced into every contract of employment by section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1970 Act , and it sat above all the other terms of the contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
284	95	It was this clause , which he described in his written case as an umbrella equality clause and which plainly did transfer over to the transferee , rather than any specific terms about the right to participate in a pension scheme , on which the claims were based . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
284	96	This , he said , reinforced his argument that , as it was wrong to see the equality clause relating to the pension rights as part of a separate contract from that which the claimant had with the transferee , the time limit in section 2 -LRB- 4 -RRB- was not affected by the transfer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
284	97	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
284	98	I am unable to accept these arguments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
284	99	As with any other issue of statutory construction , the question begins and ends with the words of the statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
284	100	The first point that must be made is that the word `` contract '' does not appear anywhere in section 2 -LRB- 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
284	101	It was used by Lord Slynn in the passage from his speech in the first Preston case , but that was in a different context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
284	102	The question which he was addressing in that case was how the word `` employment '' was to be applied to a situation where the woman was employed by the same employer but under a succession of different contracts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
284	103	For the reason that he gave , the argument that a succession of contracts could be treated as a single contract for the purposes of the time limit had to be rejected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
284	104	Where there was a succession of contracts with the same employer , the contract in respect of which the claim was made in respect of the operation of the equality clause was the relevant contract of employment for the purposes of the time limit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
284	105	But in my opinion his analysis does not provide the answer to the quite different question that has been raised in this case about the operation of the time limit where there has been a TUPE transfer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
284	106	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
284	107	The second point is that the word that the subsection uses to identify the moment which starts the running of the time limit is the word `` employment '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
284	108	The question which it asks is whether the woman was employed `` in the employment '' within the six months preceding the reference of the claim to the tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
284	109	The claim to which the time limit is to be applied is , of course , the claim in respect of the operation of an equality clause relating to the woman 's employment : see the opening words of the subsection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
284	110	When the subsection is read as whole , its plain and natural meaning is that the claim must be brought within six months of the end of the employment to which the claim relates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
284	111	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
284	112	It comes as no surprise , then , to find that the first question that was referred by the House to the European Court of Justice at the conclusion of the first Preston case -LSB- 1998 -RSB- ICR 227 was , so far as relevant to this case , framed in these terms : The European Court adopted the same wording when it answered this question in the negative : Preston and others v Wolverhampton Healthcare N H S Trust and others -LRB- Case C-78 / 98 -RRB- -LSB- 2000 -RSB- ICR 961 -LRB- ECJ -RRB- , para 35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
284	113	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
284	114	Why then should the subsection be given a different meaning when the time limit is invoked in the context of a claim relating to the operation of an equality clause which relates to a period of employment prior to the date of a TUPE transfer ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
284	115	It is true that section 2 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the 1970 Act was enacted before the coming into effect of the Acquired Rights Directive and , consequently , before the making of the TUPE regulations which transferred all the transferor 's rights , powers , duties and liabilities under or in connection with the contract of employment to the transferee but left any rights , powers , duties and liabilities under or in connection with an occupational pension scheme with the transferor : see regulations 5 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- and 7 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- of TUPE . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
284	116	But I do not think that the subsection can be taken to mean different things depending upon the part of the TUPE arrangements to which the claim relates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
284	117	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
284	118	It is often said that a statute is always speaking . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
284	119	This is so , and where the language permits there is this element of flexibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
284	120	It can be adapted to contexts that were not foreseen when it was enacted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
284	121	But the metaphor must not be pressed too far . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
284	122	A statute can not speak with two different voices at one and the same time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
284	123	The rule that section 2 -LRB- 4 -RRB- originally laid down was that a claim in respect of the operation of an equality clause must be brought within six months of the end of the employment to which the claim related . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
284	124	It applied to each and every claim that might be made in respect of the contravention of a term modified or included by virtue of an equality clause : see regulation 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
284	125	The same rule must be applied where there has been a TUPE transfer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
284	126	The only question is : to which employment does the claim relate ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
284	127	The answer , where the claim is in relation to the operation of an equality clause relating to an occupational pension scheme before the date of the transfer , is that it relates to the woman 's employment with the transferor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
284	128	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
284	129	Mr Jeans QC for the respondents submitted that this interpretation of section 2 -LRB- 4 -RRB- had the advantage of certainty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
284	130	Why , he said , should time begin to run from a date that had nothing to do with the claim in question ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
284	131	It was to be assumed that the rule was intended to enable potential defendants to know exactly when it was that time had run out for the making of claims against them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
284	132	The effect of the appellants ' argument was that a transferor would be exposed to claims relating to its occupational pension scheme indefinitely . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
284	133	The problems that it would face in maintaining the necessary records long after the business had been transferred should not be underestimated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
284	134	One of aims of TUPE was to achieve a smooth and orderly transfer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
284	135	This would be inhibited if the transferor 's liability in respect of occupational pension schemes was subject to a time limit which had nothing to do with the transferor , but was linked instead to the woman 's employment with a transferee who was excluded by regulation 7 from any share in the liability .

284	137	Mr Cavanagh said that some lack of legal certainty was inevitable , given that the time limit ran not from the date of the breach or from loss sustained as a result of it but from the end of the employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
284	138	He gave various examples of how uncertainty could arise even on the respondents ' interpretation of section 2 -LRB- 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
284	139	I think that on balance greater uncertainty is likely to be produced by the appellants ' interpretation of it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
284	140	But there is much more force in Mr Jeans ' point that the best way of achieving the purpose of the time limit is to link it as closely as possible to the liability which is the subject of the claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
284	141	This is achieved if the period of six months within which the claim relating to the operation of an equality clause with regard to an occupational pension scheme provided by the transferor must be brought runs from the end of the claimant 's employment with the transferor , to whom the liability belongs , rather than the end of her employment with the transferee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
284	142	The fact that , where disputes arise , it is the link between the employee and the employer whose rights and obligations are in issue that matters is demonstrated by section 2 -LRB- 1A -RRB- of the 1970 Act , which enables an employer to apply to an employment tribunal for an order declaring the rights of the employer and the employee where a dispute arises in relation to the effect of the operation of an equality clause . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
284	143	There is an element of symmetry here which supports the meaning that is conveyed by the words of the subsection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
284	144	It is reassuring too that it was this interpretation of the subsection that the European Court of Justice had in mind when it ruled that the limitation period was compatible with the fundamental principle of legal certainty and did not make the exercise of rights conferred by Community law virtually impossible or excessively difficult .
