74	14	LORD HUTTON 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
74	15	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
74	16	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
74	17	On the evening of 21 October 1997 the police received an anonymous telephone call that approximately 30 Asian youths armed with sticks were gathering together in Canon Street Road , London E1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
74	18	A marked police carrier with seven police officers was despatched to Canon Street Road and on arrival there about 6.50 pm the police carrier turned into Bigland Street where there is a block of residential flats called Luke House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
74	19	The police in the carrier saw 40 to 50 Asian youths milling around in a group on a raised concourse outside Luke House , 8 or 9 of whom were carrying petrol bombs consisting of milk bottles containing petrol with a tissue wick in the mouth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
74	20	When the police carrier came into view the group immediately dispersed and ran off and no violence was shown towards the police officers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
74	21	The police pursued some of the group and the three appellants were captured and arrested close to Luke House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
74	22	Before their capture the three appellants each threw away a petrol bomb which he had been carrying . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
74	23	The appellants were interviewed by the police and in the course of the interviews one of them said that he was a member of a gang called the `` Canon Street Boys '' who were going to have a fight with another gang called the `` Barnado Boys '' , and the petrol bombs were going to be thrown in the fight . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
74	24	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
74	25	The appellants were charged with the statutory offence of affray contrary to section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Public Order Act 1986 and were convicted by Mr Justin Philips , a Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate , sitting at West London Youth Court on 22 July 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
74	26	The appellants appealed to the Divisional Court by case stated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
74	27	The three cases stated set out the facts found by the learned Stipendiary Magistrate in identical terms and two of the findings are of particular relevance to the present appeal : '' -LRB- f -RRB- As the police carrier came into view , the group dispersed immediately in all directions . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
74	28	-LRB- k -RRB- Aside from the police no other persons , and in particular no member of any other gang , were shown to be present at the scene at 6.50 pm . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
74	29	It is also appropriate to set out certain other findings : '' -LRB- e -RRB- Officers in the carrier thought that petrol bombs were being carried and PC Brown thought that there could be a disturbance . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
74	30	-LRB- i -RRB- At no time was any fuse lit and when police came on the group there was no fighting , no shouting or throwing of any object . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
74	31	Nothing was said and no bottles were waved . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
74	32	-LRB- j -RRB- In the Bengali-populated East End , the street gangs are territorial and there is bad-blood between the various gangs . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
74	33	The Stipendiary Magistrate stated : `` I was of the opinion that in this part of London , with its agreed contemporary history of gang warfare , the presence of this group of youths -LRB- approximately a quarter of which was armed with petrol bombs -RRB- would threaten with violence any member of the public alighting upon the scene , whether that member of the public was a resident , a passer-by or a police officer ; and although , with the exception of the officers in the carrier , there was no evidence of anyone to whom it could be said the threat was directed , the offence of affray in this instance was made out as the armed group had congregated in public and constituted a general threat to the public at large , and that a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene of this incident would have feared for his or her safety . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
74	34	The questions set out in the case stated for the opinion of the Divisional Court were : `` 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
74	35	Was I correct in deciding that a conviction for affray under Section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Public Order Act 1986 can be recorded without evidence being adduced that any person was or believed himself to have been subjected to or threatened with violence ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
74	36	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
74	37	Was I correct in my ruling that a threat of violence towards a hypothetical person or persons or the public at large is sufficient to constitute a threat ` towards another , ' and that this threat could be inferred from the evidence that police alighting on this scene thought that petrol bombs were being carried and one officer thought there could be a disturbance . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
74	38	In his judgment in the Divisional Court -LRB- -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 1 Cr App R 251 , 254A -RRB- Auld LJ reformulated the questions : `` 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
74	39	Whether the mere possession of petrol bombs in the circumstances was capable of amounting to a threat of unlawful violence ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
74	40	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
74	41	If so , whether a threat of violence towards an unknown person or persons , or the public at large , amounted to a threat of unlawful violence ` towards another ' ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
74	42	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
74	43	And if so , whether such a threat could be inferred from the evidence of the police that they thought members of the group were carrying petrol bombs and that one officer thought there could be a disturbance ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
74	44	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
74	45	The Divisional Court dismissed the appeals and held -LRB- 1 -RRB- that the visible carrying in public of primed petrol bombs by a large number of youths `` obviously out for no good '' was clearly capable of constituting a threat of unlawful violence and -LRB- 2 -RRB- that whilst there had to be someone at or in the vicinity towards whom the threat of violence could be said to be directed , in the special circumstances of this case the overt carrying of petrol bombs , highly dangerous and untargeted in their effect if exploded , constituted a threat of violence to anyone in the vicinity , including the police on arrival on the scene . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
74	46	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
74	47	The questions certified by the Divisional Court as points of law of general public importance are : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- `` Whether the overt possession of a weapon may constitute a threat of violence for the purpose of affray when it is not used or brandished in a violent manner . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
74	48	-LRB- 2 -RRB- `` Whether in order to constitute a threat for the purpose of affray it must be directed at a particular person or whether it is sufficient , providing that there is another or others present , that it is directed generally against anyone present . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
74	49	-LRB- 3 -RRB- `` Whether , in order to constitute a threat for the purposes of affray , the threat must be perceived as such by a person against whom it is directed . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
74	50	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
74	51	I consider that the second certified question is not apposite and that the point to which it relates should be reformulated : `` In order to constitute the statutory offence of affray does the threat of unlawful violence have to be towards a person or persons present at the scene ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
74	52	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
74	53	In its Report in 1983 on Offences Relating To Public Order -LRB- Law Com No 123 -RRB- the Law Commission recommended the abolition of the common law offences of affray , riot , unlawful assembly and rout and the replacement of the first three by new statutory offences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
74	54	In its Working Paper -LRB- No 82 , 1982 -RRB- which preceded its Report the Law Commission stated : `` 4.3 The common law offence of affray is typically charged in cases of pitched street battles between rival gangs , spontaneous fights in public houses , clubs and at seaside resorts , and revenge attacks on individuals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
74	55	The offence is apparently rarely resorted to in the context of demonstrations or protests where disorder has broken out , although there is nothing in law to prevent a charge of affray being brought where serious fighting is involved in those circumstances . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
74	56	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
74	57	The long title of the Public Order Act 1986 states : `` An Act to abolish the common law offences of riot , rout , unlawful assembly and affray and certain statutory offences relating to public order ; to create new offences relating to public order ... '' Section 1 creates the statutory offence of riot which is committed where 12 or more persons who are present together use or threaten unlawful violence for a common purpose and the conduct of them -LRB- taken together -RRB- is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his personal safety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
74	58	Section 2 creates the statutory offence of violent disorder which is committed where 3 or more persons who are present together use or threaten unlawful violence and the conduct of them -LRB- taken together -RRB- is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his personal safety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
74	59	Section 3 creates the statutory offence of affray and provides : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- A person is guilty of affray if he uses or threatens unlawful violence towards another and his conduct is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his personal safety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
74	60	-LRB- 2 -RRB- Where 2 or more persons use or threaten the unlawful violence , it is the conduct of them taken together that must be considered for the purposes of subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
74	61	-LRB- 3 -RRB- For the purposes of this section a threat can not be made by the use of words alone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
74	62	-LRB- 4 -RRB- No person of reasonable firmness need actually be , or be likely to be , present at the scene . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
74	63	-LRB- 5 -RRB- Affray may be committed in private as well as in public places . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
74	64	Section 4 creates the statutory offence of conduct intended or likely to cause fear or provoke violence and provides : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- A person is guilty of an offence if he -- -LRB- a -RRB- uses towards another person threatening , abusive or insulting words or behaviour , or -LRB- b -RRB- distributes or displays to another person any writing , sign or other visible representation which is threatening , abusive or insulting , with intent to cause that person to believe that immediate unlawful violence will be used against him or another by any person , or to provoke the immediate use of unlawful violence by that person or another , or whereby that person is likely to believe that such violence will be used or it is likely that such violence will be provoked . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
74	65	-LRB- 2 -RRB- An offence under this section may be committed in a public or a private place , ... '' Section 6 provides : '' -LRB- 2 -RRB- A person is guilty of violent disorder or affray only if he intends to use or threaten violence or is aware that his conduct may be violent or threaten violence . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
74	66	Section 8 provides : `` 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
74	67	In this Part -- `` violence '' means any violent conduct , so that -- -LRB- a -RRB- except in the context of affray , it includes violent conduct towards property as well as violent conduct towards persons , and -LRB- b -RRB- it is not restricted to conduct causing or intended to cause injury or damage but includes any other violent conduct -LRB- for example , throwing at or towards a person a missile of a kind capable of causing injury which does not hit or falls short -RRB- . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
74	68	Section 9 provides : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- The common law offences of riot , rout , unlawful assembly and affray are abolished . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
74	69	The First Certified Question 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
74	70	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
74	71	the issue which arises on the first certified question is whether , as a matter of law , the carrying of petrol bombs by a group of persons can constitute a threat of violence where those petrol bombs are not being waved or brandished . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
74	72	I consider that giving the words `` threatens unlawful violence '' in section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- their ordinary and natural meaning the carrying of dangerous weapons , such as petrol bombs by a group of persons can , in some circumstances , constitute the threat of violence , without those weapons being waved or brandished . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
74	73	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
74	74	This view is supported by the authorities on the common law offence of affray . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
74	75	Whilst as Taylor LJ observed in Atkin v Director of Public Prosecutions -LRB- 1989 -RRB- 89 Cr App R 199 , 204 , a court is not assisted in construing words in a section creating a new offence by considering decisions of other courts in regard to the construction of an earlier section containing quite different words , section 3 of the 1986 Act did not create an entirely new offence but replaced the common law offence of affray and the Law Commission stated in para 3.1 of its Report that it considered that the new statutory offence `` should be similar to the common law offence with some clarification and narrowing of its elements . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
74	76	Auld LJ rightly observed at page 256F that where a statutory offence replaces a common law offence the courts should approach with care indications to be found in the earlier common law as to the elements of the offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
74	77	But he also observed that section 3 mirrors the common law alternatives of actual use and threatened use of violence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
74	78	Therefore I agree with the learned lord justice that it is permissible in this case to take into account the common law decisions on what constitutes a threat of violence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
74	79	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
74	80	In R v Sharp -LSB- 1957 -RSB- 1 QB 552 , 559 Lord Goddard CJ in considering the offence of affray cited the institutional writers and said : `` The author who devotes most attention to the matter is Hawkins , in Pleas of the Crown -LRB- 1824 -RRB- , 8th ed , vol 1 , chap 28 , p 488 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
74	81	He lays down that there may be an affray when there is no actual violence , as when a man arms himself with dangerous and unusual weapons in such a manner as will naturally cause a terror to the people . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
74	82	This , he says , was always an offence at common law and dealt with by many statutes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
74	83	He then quotes in particular the Assize of Northampton , 2 Edw 3 , c 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
74	84	Dealing with that statute he says that no wearing of arms is within the meaning of this statute unless it be accompanied with such circumstances as are apt to terrify the people . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
74	85	The wearing of unusual or dangerous weapons in public is only one species of affray and in our opinion it is open to a jury to find that the circumstances amount to an affray although no person is actually called to say he was put in terror . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
74	86	Just as the mere wearing of a sword in the days when this was a common accoutrement of the nobility and gentry would be no evidence of an affray while the carrying in public of a studded mace or battle axe might be , ... '' And , at p 560 , Lord Goddard stated that an indictment for affray is one which alleges that `` the circumstances involve a breach of the Sovereign 's peace , that it was a real disturbance of the peace by two persons fighting each other in public instead of settling their differences in the royal courts , or endeavouring by a display of force , though without necessarily using actual violence , to overawe the public , which was what was aimed at by the Assize of Northampton . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
74	87	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
74	88	In R v Taylor -LSB- 1973 -RSB- AC 964 , Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone LC stated , at p 987A : `` the extent to which the ` display of force ... without actual violence ' constitutes the offence of affray even where the element of terror is present is still not wholly clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
74	89	It seems that the brandishing of a fearful weapon does constitute the offence , and has always done so , though in most cases where this is done by an individual , a charge under the Prevention of Crimes Act 1953 would now seem preferable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
74	90	From the older authorities it seems plain enough that mere words , unaccompanied by the brandishing of a weapon or actual violence , are not enough . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
74	91	But all sorts of things are , arguably , a display of force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
74	92	I am anxious that nothing in this case should be construed as necessarily implying that anything less than an unlawful participation in a violent breach of the peace will be enough to satisfy the requirement . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
74	93	Counsel for the appellants relied on the last sentence in this passage , but Lord Hailsham recognised that it can be contended that various types of conduct may constitute a display of force , and I consider that this passage in his judgment does not assist the appellants ' case but provides support for the view that the carrying of dangerous weapons by a group of persons can constitute the threat of violence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
74	94	Smith and Hogan in Criminal Law 4th ed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
74	95	-LRB- 1978 -RRB- , p 757 , in their definition of the common law offence , also take the view that the display of force alone can constitute the commission of an affray : `` 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
74	96	Unlawful fighting or unlawful violence used by one or more persons against another or others ; or an unlawful display of force by one or more persons without actual violence ; 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
74	97	in a public place or , if on private premises , in the presence of at least one innocent person who was terrified ; and 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
74	98	in such a manner that a bystander of reasonably firm character might reasonably be expected to be terrified . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
74	99	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
74	100	Other more recent cases cited by the appellants ' counsel do not , in my opinion , advance the appellants ' case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
74	101	In R v Davison -LSB- 1992 -RSB- Crim LR 31 the defendant was convicted of affray where he had `` swiped '' a kitchen knife towards a police officer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
74	102	In R v Dixon -LSB- 1993 -RSB- Crim LR 579 the defendant was convicted of affray where he and his Alsatian type dog were pursued by two police officers and cornered in the driveway of a house and he repeated `` go on , go on '' to the dog who ran forward and bit the police officers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
74	103	No issue arose in either of those cases as to whether the carrying of a weapon could constitute a threat of violence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
74	104	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
74	105	In R v Robinson -LSB- 1993 -RSB- Crim LR 581 the defendant was convicted of affray where he and his co-accused asked a motorist in an aggressive manner to drive them to a particular destination and threatened to take the car if he did not do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
74	106	Section 3 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1986 Act provides that on a charge of affray a threat can not be made by the use of words alone , but at the trial counsel for the Crown argued that in addition to what was said there was conduct which created an aura of menace . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
74	107	The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on the ground that the evidence was devoid of anything that went beyond the use of words alone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
74	108	In R v Sanchez -LSB- 1996 -RSB- Crim LR 572 the defendant was convicted of an affray when she had lunged at her boyfriend with a knife in a car park . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
74	109	On appeal the Court of Appeal quashed the conviction because the trial judge had failed to direct the jury to consider whether a reasonable hypothetical bystander would have feared for his personal safety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
74	110	Again neither of these cases was concerned with the issue whether the carrying of dangerous weapons by a group of persons can constitute a threat of violence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
74	111	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
74	112	Therefore I am of the opinion that as a matter of law the carrying of dangerous weapons such as petrol bombs by a group of persons can constitute a threat of violence within the meaning of section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
74	113	Whether it does so in a particular case is a matter for the tribunal of fact to decide having regard to the facts of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
74	114	Accordingly I am in full agreement with that part of the judgment of Auld LJ where he said , at p 257C : `` In my judgment , the visible carrying in public of primed petrol bombs by a large number of what was obviously an East London gang out for no good was clearly capable of constituting a threat of unlawful violence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
74	115	That is so whether it is characterised as a show of force or simply an obviously threatening spectacle , and regardless of the fact that the armed gang members were not yet throwing or brandishing their weapons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
74	116	I stress , however , that mere possession of a weapon , without threatening circumstances of the sort that I have mentioned , is not enough to constitute a threat of unlawful violence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
74	117	So , for example , the mere carrying of a concealed weapon could not itself be such a threat . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
74	118	The Second -LRB- Reformulated -RRB- Question 17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
74	119	The offence of affray , both at common law and now under statute , was primarily intended to punish a person or persons who engaged in a face to face confrontation where violence was used or threatened and where reasonably firm-minded members of the public would be put in fear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
74	120	As Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ said in R v Smith -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 1 Cr App R 14 , 17B : `` It typically involves a group of people who may well be shouting , struggling , threatening , waving weapons , throwing objects , exchanging and threatening blows and so on . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
74	121	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
74	122	The appellants submit that the offence of affray requires three persons : a person who uses or threatens unlawful violence , a person at whom he directs the violence or threat -LRB- the victim -RRB- , and a hypothetical bystander of reasonable firmness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
74	123	The appellants further submit that the victim must be present at the scene . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
74	124	In support of this submission they rely on the words `` towards another '' in section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
74	125	They contend that unlawful violence can not be threatened towards another unless that other person is present . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
74	126	They rely on the judgment of Taylor LJ in Atkin v Director of Public Prosecutions -LSB- 1989 -RSB- 89 Cr App R 199 , 204-205 where , in considering the words in section 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1986 Act , he said : `` The phrase ` uses towards another person ' means , in the context of section 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- ` uses in the presence of and in the direction of another person directly .

74	128	The Crown submits that where a person is in possession of a weapon , such as a bomb , which if it were detonated could cause injury to persons close to , but not present at , the location where the offender is holding the bomb , violence would be threatened towards those persons within the meaning of section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- .

74	130	The Crown also submits that in this case the group of youths were congregated near a block of residential flats at a time when people would be returning to them from work and it could be inferred that members of the public were bound to be in the vicinity even if they were not present at the scene where the youths were gathered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
74	131	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
74	132	The Crown further submits that the judgment of Taylor LJ in Atkin v Director of Public Prosecutions on the meaning of the words `` uses towards another person threatening ... words '' in section 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1986 Act does not assist in deciding the meaning of the different words in section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- `` uses or threatens unlawful violence towards another '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
74	133	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
74	134	If the point were to be determined by having regard only to the words of section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , there would be some degree of force in the Crown 's submissions , because I think that giving the words their ordinary meaning violence can be threatened towards another person even if that person is not present when the threatening conduct takes place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
74	135	But section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- was enacted to give effect to the recommendation of the Law Commission in its Report and in paragraph 3.15 of the White Paper setting out its proposals for the reform of Public Order Law -LRB- 1985 -RRB- Cmnd 9510 the Government stated in relation to affray that it was `` content to accept the Law Commission 's proposed statutory definition '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
74	136	Therefore it is permissible , and indeed desirable , for the courts to have regard to the view of the Law Commission on this issue and to know the basis on which it recommended that threatening unlawful violence towards another , as well as using unlawful violence towards another , should constitute the offence of affray -LRB- see : R v Shivpuri -LSB- 1987 -RSB- AC 1 , 21B and M/S Aswan Engineering Establishment Co v Lupdine Ltd -LSB- 1987 -RSB- 1 WLR 1 , 14E -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
74	137	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
74	138	In its Report the Law Commission discussed the elements of the statutory offence of affray which it was recommending and explained why , contrary to its earlier view , it considered that threats of violence , without the actual use of violence , should also constitute the offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
74	139	It is desirable to set out the relevant paragraphs in full : '' -LRB- a -RRB- Using or threatening violence 3.13 Common law affray requires the defendant to have engaged in unlawful fighting or violence , or a display of force without actual violence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
74	140	All recent reported cases appear to have involved actual fighting or violence and , although the element of display of force is accepted as part of the law , precisely what this connotes is not clear : brandishing of a ` fearful weapon ' is probably sufficient , but not ` mere words , unaccompanied by the brandishing of a weapon or actual violence ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
74	141	3.14 Primarily because of the absence of reported cases in recent times relating to the element of display of force , we proposed in our Working Paper that mere threats or displays of violence should be excluded from any new offence replacing the common law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
74	142	We pointed to the range of other offences capable of dealing with such threats , and noted that the scheme of offences in the Working Paper made provision for penalties to be imposed for serious threats or displays of force by a group under the terms of the proposed statutory offence of unlawful assembly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
74	143	Nevertheless , we stressed that , were evidence presented to us of the need to include threats within the new offence , the issue would require reconsideration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
74	144	3.15 A substantial majority of those commenting on our Working Paper approved our proposed exclusion of threats or displays of force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
74	145	Cogent evidence has , however , been presented to us by others which persuades us that our provisional proposal should be changed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
74	146	In particular , it has been urged on us that there is no reason of substance why , in this context , a punch thrown which misses should be distinguished from one which lands on another person ; and , if there were insufficient evidence to show that any of those accused actually succeeded in hitting another , no-one , upon our provisional proposal , would have been guilty of the offence , and a person who punched but missed would not , therefore , have been liable for aiding and abetting . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
74	147	And a person closely connected with an affray , such as an individual brandishing a razor , would if threats were excluded from the ambit of the offence , not be guilty of it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
74	148	Some threats of violence might be met with charges of possessing an offensive weapon under the Prevention of Crime Act 1953 ; this , however , would only be the case if there were proof of such possession , and in the case of , say , a mob terrifying shoppers in a shopping precinct there may be insuperable difficulties in proving which person had a particular weapon . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
74	149	3.16 These examples of the difficulties which could arise on our provisional proposals have impressed us . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
74	150	Perhaps the most persuasive argument is that , under those proposals , those engaged in what was in all respects one incident would have been capable of being prosecuted only be means of charges of different offences -- affray and unlawful assembly -- according to whether it appeared that they were hitting another or merely threatening to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
74	151	In the context of street fighting such a distinction seems artificial : we believe , on reconsideration , that any offence which is aimed , in broad terms , at unlawful fighting to the terror of the public should be capable of penalising all those concerned in a particular incident , whether the evidence is that -- -LRB- i -RRB- in some cases blows actually landed on others , -LRB- ii -RRB- in others it is uncertain whether blows landed , or -LRB- iii -RRB- some defendants were merely threatening blows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
74	152	Under our provisional proposals , only those falling within -LRB- i -RRB- would have been liable to be penalised for affray . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
74	153	We now recommend that under any new offence persons in all three categories should be liable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
74	154	This will enable the court to do justice on the whole of the evidence relating to a particular incident . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
74	155	It must be accepted , however , that a broadening of the categories of prohibited acts in this way would permit the offence to be charged when no-one was actually engaged in acts of fighting . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
74	156	On the other hand , common law affray can at present be charged where the relevant conduct consists of threats alone , but we have no evidence that the offence is used in that way save where it is justified by quite exceptional circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
74	157	We would expect no change in prosecution practice under any new offence replacing the common law . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
74	158	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
74	159	Therefore it is apparent that the Law Commission and Parliament intended that the offence set out in section 3 should penalise those who engage in a fight , whether they are landing blows , or attempting to land blows , or threatening to land blows , but it is also clear that in such circumstances the victim or victims are bound to be present with the offender or offenders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
74	160	Accordingly I regard it as clear that the section does not make guilty of an affray a person whose conduct constitutes a threat of violence to persons who are not present . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
74	161	This conclusion also derives support from the requirement in subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- that the conduct of the offender is such that it would cause a bystander `` present at the scene '' to fear for his personal safety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
74	162	The concept of presence at the scene suggests that the notional bystander would be in the presence of both the offender and the victim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
74	163	It is also relevant to observe that there is no reported case of affray where the victim was not present at the scene where the accused threatened violence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
74	164	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
74	165	In the Divisional Court Auld LJ stated , at pp 258 and 259 : `` In my judgment , where there is a threat of violence taking the form of a gathering of armed persons in a public place , it is not necessary to prove that a person or persons present actually felt threatened -LRB- see Swanston v Director of Public Prosecutions , -LSB- -LRB- 1996 -RRB- 161 JP 203 -RSB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
74	166	It is plain from the sight of an armed gathering in public that at least those openly displaying their weapons constitute a threat of violence to someone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
74	167	That could be any local resident or other member of the public who happened to see them and also police officers called to the scene . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
74	168	The hypothetical bystander , for whose protection the offence of affray is primarily designed , is not to know precisely when and where and towards whom the threatened violence will occur . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
74	169	It is enough for him that there is such a threat to someone which puts him in fear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
74	170	This is not introducing into the offence of affray a notional victim of threatened violence to join the notional bystander of reasonable firmness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
74	171	There must have been someone at or in the vicinity towards whom the threat of violence can be said to have been directed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
74	172	Often that can readily be inferred where such behaviour takes place in a public place , and , as I have said , may include police officers who attend , whether or not , when there , they perceive a threat of violence directed towards themselves . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
74	173	The circumstances of explosive devices such as those here would constitute a threat towards anyone in the immediate vicinity and in all directions , whatever their lack of connection with those charged or their role at the scene . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
74	174	Here , the obvious inference from the scene of a threat of violence by the group of armed youths towards someone other than themselves had as its background the magistrate 's unchallenged finding that in that part of the East End of London there were street gangs who were territorially based and that there was bad blood between them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
74	175	He was entitled also , in the special circumstances of this case , to find , as he did , that the diffuse threat of violence , inherent in the overt carrying of petrol bombs -- highly dangerous and untargeted in their effect if exploded -- constituted a threat of violence to anyone in the vicinity , including the police on arrival on the scene . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
74	176	The police officers ' perception , or lack of it , of themselves as particular targets is immaterial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
74	177	Accordingly , I would answer `` yes '' to the second question , that of whether a threat of violence towards an unknown person or persons or the public at large at the scene amounts to a threat of unlawful violence towards another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
74	178	It follows from what I have said that it is not necessary to answer the third question , which goes in the main to the police witnesses ' own perception of a threat of violence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
74	179	The fact that they did not speak of a threat , in the form , say , of brandishing the petrol bombs either at others or themselves , and that one of them merely thought , whether before or on arrival at the scene , that there could be a disturbance , does not mean that there was no evidence , on the facts as found by the magistrate , of a threat of unlawful violence towards another or others . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
74	180	For the reasons he gave and which I have in substance and at greater length repeated , there plainly was . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
74	181	Hughes J stated , at pp 260 - 261 : `` 5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
74	182	Affray does require the presence of a person threatened . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
74	183	The person of reasonable firmness who is referred to in section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- is a hypothetical person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
74	184	He is often conveniently referred to as the ` hypothetical bystander ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
74	185	He represents the standard by which the gravity of the behaviour is to be judged and he demonstrates that this public order offence is designed for the protection of the public . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
74	186	But although the bystander is hypothetical , the person threatened with unlawful violence is not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
74	187	It seems to me possible that the person who is threatened may be unaware of it , for example , if his back was turned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
74	188	However , the person threatened must exist and he or she must be there . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
74	189	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
74	190	Such person threatened may , however , be of unknown identity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
74	191	Moreover , a threat may be made generally in a populous place to all about . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
74	192	In a case like the present , that might include the men , women and children able to see from the windows of the flats , or those who were entering or leaving at a little short of 7 pm . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
74	193	Even without the evidence of such a person being given to the court , a court is entitled in an appropriate case to conclude , as a matter of fact , that such persons were indeed threatened by the conduct of the defendant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
74	194	Indeed , in the present case , someone telephoned the police . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
74	195	However , in the present case , the magistrate has specifically found , as follows : ` Aside from the police no other persons and in particular no member of any other gang was shown to be present at the scene at 6.50 pm ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
74	196	He has therefore not found , as he might perhaps have done , that others were there and were threatened . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
74	197	A finding that there was no one there to be threatened but anyone who might appear in the future would be likely to be threatened is not sufficient . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
74	198	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
74	199	That a police constable thinks that a disturbance might ensue is not by itself enough . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
74	200	If what he contemplates is no more than a future event , there is no present threat . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
74	201	Affray requires a threat rather than a risk of a future threat . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
74	202	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
74	203	On the special facts of this case , for the reasons that have been fully explained by Auld LJ , the magistrate was entitled to conclude that , whether or not the police officers said that they felt threatened , the threat was a general one , and was in fact made towards them at a time when they were present . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
74	204	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
74	205	Therefore both Auld LJ and Hughes J recognised that the victim or victims towards whom the threat is directed must be present . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
74	206	But I consider , with respect , that they erred in applying this requirement to the facts as found by the Stipendiary Magistrate and set out in the case stated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
74	207	It was not open to Auld LJ to find that the overt carrying of petrol bombs constituted a threat of violence to anyone in the vicinity , including the police on arrival at the scene , because the Magistrate found that no one other than the police was present at the scene , and he also found by clear implication that the group of youths constituted no threat towards the police as the group dispersed immediately the police carrier came into view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
74	208	Similarly it was not open to Hughes J to find in paragraph 8 of his judgment that there was a threat towards the police officers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
74	209	In order to constitute an offence under section 3 there must be a threat of violence towards another person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
74	210	Whilst the carrying of petrol bombs can constitute a threat of violence , it does not necessarily follow that because a person is present at a location where a gang are carrying petrol bombs there is a threat of violence towards that person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
74	211	Whether there is a threat of violence towards a person present at the scene constituted by the carrying of a weapon or weapons will depend on the facts of the actual case , but that issue does not arise in the present case because , apart from the police officers towards whom there was no threat , no one was present at the scene . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
74	212	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
74	213	Accordingly I would answer `` Yes '' to the first certified question and `` Yes '' to the second -LRB- reformulated -RRB- question and would allow the appeals on the ground which I have stated in relation to the second question . 	lord hutton	self	outcome	0.9	lord hutton
74	214	I think that the third certified question was intended to relate to a situation where a person threatened was not present at the scene , and therefore it does not now arise for consideration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
74	215	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
74	216	The appellants were clearly guilty of criminal conduct and it would have been open to the prosecuting authorities to have charged them with the carrying of an offensive weapon contrary to section 1 of the Prevention of Crime Act 1953 or with possession of explosives contrary to section 4 of the Explosive Substances Act 1883 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
74	217	It appears that there is an increasing tendency to charge the offence of affray and in the year 2000 there were 1,891 offences of affray charged in the Metropolitan Police area . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hutton
74	218	The present case demonstrates that a person should not be charged with the offence unless he uses or threatens unlawful violence towards another person actually present at the scene and his conduct is such as would cause fear to a notional bystander of reasonable firmness .
