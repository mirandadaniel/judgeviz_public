52	7	I am also in very substantial agreement with the careful and well-reasoned judgment given by Dyson LJ in the Court of Appeal : -LSB- 2001 -RSB- EWCA Civ 1196 ; -LSB- 2002 -RSB- INLR 310 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN

52	15	On this appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal the issue is whether a special adjudicator adopted the correct approach in law to the question whether an applicant for refugee status had a well-founded fear of persecution within the meaning of article 1A of the Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees -LRB- 1951 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
52	16	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
52	17	In the United Kingdom effect is given to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees by the grant of asylum . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
52	18	Under paragraph 334 of the Immigration Rules -LRB- HC 395 -RRB- an asylum applicant will be granted asylum only if the Secretary of State `` is satisfied that '' he is a refugee as defined by the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
52	19	An applicant who does not meet that criterion will be refused : see paragraph 336 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	20	A refusal of asylum may be appealed on the ground that it would be `` contrary to the Convention '' to refuse the applicant leave to enter or to require him to leave the United Kingdom : see section 69 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	21	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	22	Article 1A of the Convention defines a `` refugee '' as : `` any person -LRB- 2 -RRB- owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion , is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country ; '' For present purposes the question is whether the applicant had a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , membership of a particular social group or political opinion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	23	Article 1F of the Convention provides : `` The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that : -LRB- a -RRB- he has committed a crime against peace , a war crime , or a crime against humanity , as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes ; -LRB- b -RRB- he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee ; -LRB- c -RRB- he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	24	It was common ground that article 1F and in particular 1F -LRB- b -RRB- , is not applicable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	25	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	26	The applicant arrived in the United Kingdom in 1997 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	27	He applied for asylum . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	28	In 1998 his claim was dismissed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	29	He was then aged 24 years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	30	He is a Tamil from Jaffna in the north of Sri Lanka , the main centre of the terrorist activities of LTTE or the Tamil Tigers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	31	Before the special adjudicator there was a synopsis of a US State Department Report of 1999 -LRB- for the year 1998 -RRB- on the position in Sri Lanka . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	32	It included the following passage : `` despite legal prohibitions , the security forces continue to torture and mistreat persons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	33	They continue to torture and mistreat detainees -LRB- male and female -RRB- particularly during investigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	34	Most torture victims are Tamils suspected of being LTTE insurgents or collaborators . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	35	Subject to an immaterial exception , the special adjudicator accepted the account of the primary facts given by the applicant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	36	His evidence was that , although he was not an LTTE sympathiser or supporter , he had been detained and ill-treated by authorities in Sri Lanka . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	37	The special adjudicator did not comment in any way on the severity of the ill-treatment and did not describe it as torture . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	38	This is how he described the position in his conclusions : `` There is no particular reason not to accept the appellant 's evidence , except about setting off for a completely unknown destination , rather than stay in Colombo : that is absurd , particularly given the large sum his family had paid for the trip . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	39	However , on the appellant 's own account he was detained and ill-treated in the past on the various occasions he mentions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	40	10.2 on suspicion of training Tamil Tigers 16.4 on suspicion of being a Tiger 25.2 for being a ` black Tiger ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	41	Unpleasant though the consequences were , they were not the result of any political opinions he might have been thought to hold , but of being suspected , however unjustly , of involvement in violent terrorism . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	42	That does not in my view come within the protection of the Convention , and there is nothing else in the evidence to show that he in particular would face persecution if returned to Sri Lanka : it was not argued that northern Tamils in general would do so ; nor should I accept that , for the reasons given at paragraph 2 above . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	43	-LRB- Emphasis supplied -RRB- It may not be unfair to say that the italicised words prima facie indicate that the severity of the ill-treatment in this case made no significant impact on the special adjudicator 's approach to the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	44	In any event , he dismissed the claim to asylum . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	45	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	46	Cases involving claims for refugee status under the Convention are particularly fact-sensitive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	47	The severity of the treatment inflicted on the applicant by the authorities in Sri Lanka has a logical bearing on the issues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	48	Why this is so can readily be demonstrated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	49	The important UNHCR Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status -LRB- 1979 -RRB- explains , at p 610 , para 85 : `` there may be reason to believe that a political offender would be exposed to excessive or arbitrary punishment for the alleged offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	50	Such excessive or arbitrary punishment will amount to persecution . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	51	The Court of Appeal held in the present case that the second sentence is phrased too strongly : p 318 , para 26 of the judgment of the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	52	For `` will '' one should substitute `` may '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	53	Subject to this qualification the guidance is valuable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	54	If excessive or arbitrary punishment may tip the scales in favour of a conclusion that there was persecution meriting protection under the Convention , it must follow that if agents of the state inflict brutal torture on persons suspected , fairly or unfairly , of involvement in terrorism , that may equally engage the protection of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	55	Since the special adjudicator did not describe the primary facts relating to the ordeal suffered by the applicant in Sri Lanka , I must set out the facts in explicit but necessary detail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	56	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
52	57	The facts found by the special adjudicator , and accepted by the Home Secretary , are as follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
52	58	In 1993 the applicant travelled to the east coast of Sri Lanka to work at a mill owned by his brother-in-law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
52	59	In the latter part of 1994 , the Tamil Tigers came and took his brother-in-law away . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
52	60	They also took a lorry belonging to his brother-in-law , which was used to carry out an attack on a nearby army camp . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
52	61	The lorry was traced back to the mill . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
52	62	A military Special Task Force took the applicant away and detained him in a house near a beach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
52	63	On arrival at the house he was attacked by three soldiers , and told that when the officer arrived , he was to say that he was a member of the Tamil Tigers and that he had come south to attack the army camp . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
52	64	He was detained for about a month . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN

52	75	He and other detainees were kicked and their knees beaten with rifle butts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
52	76	On one occasion , an officer attacked him with kicks and punches which broke his nose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
52	77	He fainted as a result of the pain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
52	78	The applicant was also forced to witness others being tortured . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
52	79	Another detainee was tied face first to a tree and a bottle was forced into his anus . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
52	80	Others were cut all over their bodies with razor blades . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
52	81	The applicant and other detainees were forced to watch people being burned on the beach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
52	82	He was not sure whether the people were dead before burning tyres were put around them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN

52	85	In about April 1996 , the applicant and his brother started working at a co-operative society establishment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
52	86	From time to time , he transported goods on a lorry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
52	87	When the lorry left it would be stopped at a checkpoint . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
52	88	At the checkpoint , a hooded informer sat in a sentry box . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
52	89	In June 1997 the applicant was identified as a Tamil Tiger by the informer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
52	90	He was thrown into the back of an army jeep and his hands were tied behind his back . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
52	91	He was taken to an army camp . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
52	92	On arrival at the camp , he was dragged into a room and beaten . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
52	93	His torturers took a plastic bag and immersed it in petrol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
52	94	The bag was placed over his head and tied around his neck so that the vapour burned his nose and eyes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN

52	100	He was stripped naked and the soles of his feet were beaten . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
52	101	He was placed on a chair , which his torturers then kicked away so that he fell to the floor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
52	102	He would then be lifted up by his ears . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
52	103	On occasion , his hands were tied behind his back by his two thumbs , and he was lifted from the floor by a pulley device . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
52	104	On at least five occasions , he witnessed others who had been killed being burned with petrol soaked tyres . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
52	105	After three days at the camp , the applicant agreed to act as an informer , as the torture was becoming unbearable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
52	106	Having agreed to do so , he says that the level of torture became less severe . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
52	107	On 16 August 1997 , he was released , again as a result of a bribe . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

52	112	He had arrived in Colombo without an identity card as it had been retained at the army camp . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
52	113	He was taken to a police station and put in a dirty cell with two others . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
52	114	The applicant stated that in the police station the officers `` merely '' beat him and punched him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
52	115	He was beaten with a baton and with the butt of a rifle on his back and shoulders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

52	121	There was a medical report by Dr John Rundle , who had examined the applicant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

52	124	Torture is a strong word . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
52	126	The word however , applies in full measure to the barbarous treatment of the applicant by the authorities in Sri Lanka . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
52	127	Rightly counsel for the Home Secretary accepted before the House that such conduct must always be condemned even if used in the fight against terrorism . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
52	128	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
52	129	Reverting to the forensic chronology , the next step was that the applicant applied for leave to appeal to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
52	130	On 23 June 1999 The Immigration Appeal Tribunal refused leave to appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
52	131	The tribunal observed : `` The adjudicator appears to have considered all the evidence before him , properly directing himself as to the proper standard of proof . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
52	132	The adjudicator came to clear findings of fact , after giving to each element in the evidence the weight he considered appropriate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
52	133	The tribunal has studied the papers on file . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	134	It considers that the conclusions of the adjudicator are fully supported by the evidence , bearing in mind the adjudicator 's assessment of the oral evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	135	There is no misdirection in law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	136	Read as a whole the determination is a full , fair and reasoned review of the applicant 's case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	137	In the opinion of the tribunal this is not a proper case in which to grant leave , and such leave is refused . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	138	On 22 January 2001 Cresswell J refused an application for leave to grant judicial review of that decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	139	The judge observed that the decision of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal was not beyond the range of responses open to a reasonable decision-maker . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	140	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	141	The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	142	Procedurally the issue before the Court of Appeal was whether the Immigration Appeal Tribunal erred in concluding that the adjudicator 's decision disclosed no arguable error of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	143	On 24 July 2001 , Dyson LJ -LRB- with the agreement of Thorpe LJ and Wright J -RRB- concluded that the tribunal should have given leave to appeal and gave a judgment allowing the appeal and quashing the tribunal 's decision : -LSB- 2001 -RSB- EWCA Civ 1196 ; -LSB- 2002 -RSB- INLR 310 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	144	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	145	Dyson LJ put in the forefront of his discussion the fact that the applicant had been tortured in appalling ways . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	146	It was common ground before the court that the applicant had been subjected to persecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	147	Accordingly , Dyson LJ observed that the issue for the special adjudicator was whether , in the light of -LRB- a -RRB- the then current situation facing young male Tamils from Jaffna generally , and -LRB- b -RRB- the applicant 's previous experiences , there was a reasonable likelihood of persecution if he were to return , in particular , to Sri Lanka : see p 316 , para 19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	148	He crisply and accurately held that it was necessary for the person who is considering the claim for asylum to assess carefully the real reason for the persecution : p 317 , para 23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	149	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	150	Dealing directly with the special adjudicator 's reasoning , Dyson LJ held , at p 317 , para 22 : `` if the positive proposition that a person has been persecuted for suspected involvement in violent terrorism is true , it does not necessarily follow that the negative proposition that he has not therefore been persecuted for his political opinion is also true . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	151	The two propositions are not mutually exclusive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	152	The effective reason for the persecution will depend on the facts in any particular case . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	153	Dyson LJ 's conclusions were in the following paragraphs , at pp 320-321 : `` 30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	154	I would hold , therefore , that where a person to whom a political opinion is imputed or who is a member of a race or social group is the subject of sanctions that do not apply generally in the state , then it is more likely than not that the application of the sanctions is discriminatory and persecutory for a Convention reason . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	155	That is where there is a prosecution followed , in the event of conviction , by a sentence imposed by a court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	156	The inference of persecution for a Convention reason is all the stronger where , as in the present case , the sanction is torture by state authorities which is not even lawful by the law of the state concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	157	It is essential that , as was said in Paramananthan -LSB- v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs -LRB- 1998 -RRB- 160 ALR 24 -RSB- , the question whether there was a causal connection between the torture and the appellant 's perceived sympathy for the LTTE as well as his ethnicity should be examined with close and anxious scrutiny . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	158	It has been said time and again that asylum cases call for consideration with `` the most anxious scrutiny '' : see , for example , R v Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex p Bugdaycay -LSB- 1987 -RSB- AC 514 , 531F-G . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	159	That is not a mantra to which only lip service should be paid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	160	It recognises the fact that what is at stake in these cases is fundamental human rights , including the right to life itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	161	That degree of scrutiny is called for to a heightened degree in a case such as this where it is accepted that the appellant has been tortured for alleged involvement in political crimes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	162	Conclusion 31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	163	In my view , it was insufficient for the special adjudicator to deal with the matter in the way that he did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	164	It is not clear why he decided that the appellant had not been maltreated for reasons of his political opinion , or his ethnicity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	165	There is no indication that he approached the matter on the basis that the torture raised an inference that he had been persecuted for a Convention reason . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

52	170	Taken together with the appellant 's own experiences , -LSB- there -RSB- was powerful evidence that Tamils who were -LRB- however unjustly -RRB- suspected of involvement with the LTTE were tortured by the state authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
52	171	In my judgment , this raised a strong inference that they were , or that it is at least reasonably likely that they were , persecuted for reasons of imputed political opinion or ethnicity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	172	The special adjudicator did not identify any factors which supported his assertion that the ill-treatment was not for reasons of imputed political opinion , but was for suspected involvement in violent terrorism . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN

52	174	On appeal to the House both sides adopted extreme positions on the central issues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	175	Counsel for the Home Secretary submitted that persecution by agents of the state in the process of investigating suspected terrorist acts necessarily falls outside the protective net of article 1A . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	176	On the other hand , counsel for the applicant submitted that such persecution in the course of an investigation into suspected terrorist acts necessarily falls within the protective net of article 1A since terrorism involves matters of political opinion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	177	Both submissions go too far . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	178	For my part Dyson LJ correctly analysed the position in the passage of his judgment quoted at paragraph 16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	179	It all depends on the facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	180	As Lord Lloyd of Berwick observed in T v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 742 , 778 , not all terrorist acts fall outside the protection of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	181	In other words not all means of investigating suspected terrorist acts fall outside the protection of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	182	The reasons of the special adjudicator indicate that he took the view that the mere fact `` of being suspected , however unjustly , of involvement in violent terrorism '' took the case outside the terms of article 1A . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	183	In reasoning in this way he was in error . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	184	It was not a sufficient reason for concluding that the applicant was not ill-treated for a Convention reason . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	185	The case had to be considered in the round , giving due weight particularly to the evidence of extreme torture . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	186	On this ground alone , I would hold that the Immigration Appeal Tribunal was wrong to hold that the special adjudicator 's reasoning was free from error . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	187	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	188	Moreover , if the case is considered globally , the conclusion is justified that there was a strong claim to refugee status . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	189	The evaluation of the material facts must not be compartmentalised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	190	It is necessary to consider the cumulative effect of the relevant factors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	191	First , the applicant was a Tamil from the North of Sri Lanka which was plagued by the terrorist activities of Tamil Tigers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	192	Secondly , there was evidence of widespread torture of persons and , in the words of the synopsis of a near contemporary US State Department Report `` most torture victims are Tamils suspected of being LTTE insurgents or collaborators '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	193	Thirdly , and crucially , the Sri Lankan authorities subjected the applicant to sustained , exceptionally sadistic and humiliating torture . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	194	In combination these factors suggest that if the applicant had been returned to Sri Lanka , at the time of the special adjudicator 's decision , the applicant 's stated belief that he `` was in daily fear everywhere in Sri Lanka '' was not surprising . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	195	On a realistic view of the facts there was a reasonable likelihood of persecution on the ground of race -LRB- since he was a Tamil -RRB- , a member of a particular social group -LRB- he was a Tamil from Jaffna -RRB- or political opinion -LRB- the separatist views predominant among Tamils from the North -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	196	However , the special adjudicator did not consider the matter in these terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	197	Indeed he gave no weight or virtually no weight to the predominant feature of this case , viz the repeated infliction of barbarous acts of torture . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	198	On this ground too I would hold that the decision of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal was in error . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	199	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	200	There is , however , another feature of this case which requires careful consideration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	201	Counsel for the Home Secretary submitted that in speaking of inference at several places in his judgment Dyson LJ conveyed the idea that such `` inferences '' imposed a legal duty on the decision-maker to recognise and apply the operative `` inference '' which attracts the protection of article 1A . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	202	Put differently the argument is that Dyson LJ created rebuttable presumptions which it would be an error for a decision-maker to fail to apply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	203	If this is what Dyson LJ meant to say , I would respectfully agree that it would be a wrong approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	204	I am , however , satisfied that by using the word inference Dyson LJ meant to say no more than that on an overall view of the evidence there was a reasonable likelihood of a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	205	The inferences were merely steps in the reasoning leading to an ultimate conclusion reached on an orthodox application of the burden of proof . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	206	In my view therefore the Home Secretary 's fears about the effect of Dyson LJ 's judgment are , on analysis , not justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	207	The true position is not in doubt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
52	208	The correct approach was explained by Sedley LJ in Karanakaran v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 3 All ER 449 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
52	209	He said , at p 477 : `` The issues for a decision-maker under the Convention -LRB- whether the decision-maker is a Home Office official , a special adjudicator or the Immigration Appeal Tribunal -RRB- are questions not of hard fact but of evaluation : does the applicant have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN

52	211	If so , is he nevertheless able to find safety elsewhere in his home country ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
52	212	Into all of these , of course , a mass of factual questions enters : What has happened to the applicant ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN

52	216	Is it feasible for the applicant to live there ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
52	217	Inseparable from these are questions of evaluation : Did what happened to the applicant amount to persecution ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
52	218	If so , what was the reason for it ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
52	219	Does what has been happening to others shed light on the applicant 's fear ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
52	220	Is the home situation now better or worse ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
52	221	How safe are the safer places ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
52	222	Is it unduly harsh to expect the applicant to survive in a new and strange place ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
52	223	He continued , at p 479 : `` Such decision-makers , on classic principles of public law , are required to take everything material into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
52	224	Their sources of information will frequently go well beyond the testimony of the applicant and include in-country reports , expert testimony and - sometimes - specialist knowledge of their own -LRB- which must of course be disclosed -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
52	225	No probabilistic cut-off operates here : everything capable of having a bearing has to be given the weight , great or little , due to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
52	226	What the decision-makers ultimately make of the material is a matter for their own conscientious judgment , so long as the procedure by which they approach and entertain it is lawful and fair and provided their decision logically addresses the Convention issues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
52	227	Finally , and importantly , the Convention issues from first to last are evaluative , not factual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
52	228	The facts , so far as they can be established , are signposts on the road to a conclusion on the issues : they are not themselves conclusions . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
52	229	In short as Lord Hoffmann observed in R v Immigration Appeal Tribunal , Ex p Shah -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 629 , 655F each claim to refugee status case must always depend on the evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN

52	250	Therefore I am able to turn directly to consider the issues which arise on the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	251	Article 1A of the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees defines a `` refugee '' as : `` any person who : ... owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion , is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country ; or who , not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events , is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to return to it . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	252	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	253	The principal issue which arises is whether the persecution which the applicant feared was for reasons of race or membership of a particular social group or political opinion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	254	The main submission advanced by Mr Underwood QC , on behalf of the Secretary of State , was that the applicant was singled out for detention and ill treatment , not for reasons of race or membership of a particular social group or political opinion , but because of his suspected involvement in terrorist activities and in order to obtain information to assist the security forces in combating Tamil terrorism and to assist in the identification of other terrorists . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	255	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	256	The main submission advanced by Mr Nicol QC on behalf of the applicant was that the LTTE carried out their terrorist activities for a political objective which was to secure an independent state for the Tamil people living in the northern area of Sri Lanka . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	257	Therefore he submitted that where a person was detained and ill-treated on suspicion of involvement in terrorism in support of the Tamil cause it followed that his ill treatment constituted persecution by reason of his race -LRB- he was a Tamil -RRB- or membership of a particular social group -LRB- a Tamil from Jaffna -RRB- or political opinion -LRB- the Tamils ' desire for independence -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	258	In support of this submission he relied on paragraphs 84 and 85 of the UNHCR Handbook which state : `` 84 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	259	Where a person is subject to prosecution or punishment for a political offence , a distinction may have to be drawn according to whether the prosecution is for political opinion or for politically-motivated acts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	260	If the prosecution pertains to a punishable act committed out of political motives , and if the anticipated punishment is in conformity with the general law of the country concerned , fear of such prosecution will not in itself make the applicant a refugee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	261	85 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	262	Whether a political offender can also be considered a refugee will depend upon various other factors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	263	Prosecution for an offence may , depending upon the circumstances , be a pretext for punishing the offender for his political opinions or the expression thereof . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	264	Again , there may be reason to believe that a political offender would be exposed to excessive or arbitrary punishment for the alleged offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	265	Such excessive or arbitrary punishment will amount to persecution . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	266	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	267	I do not accept Mr Nicol 's submission that if a person is suspected of committing terrorist crimes in furtherance of a political objective and is detained by the security forces to be questioned about his suspected terrorist activities and the activities of other terrorists , he is necessarily subjected to such treatment for reasons of political opinion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	268	I consider that there can be cases where the authorities detain and question and , if sufficient evidence is available , prosecute a person suspected of being a terrorist where the reason for such treatment is solely their concern to combat terrorism . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	269	In such a case the fact that the terrorist organisation to which the person is suspected of belonging carries out its violent activities for a political objective does not mean that the person is subjected to that treatment for reasons of his political opinion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	270	But , of course , where measures are taken by the authorities against a person for alleged criminal acts against the ruling power , the real reason may be because of that person 's political opinion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	271	As paragraph 81 of the Handbook observes , where measures are taken against a person for reasons of his political opinion , `` Such measures have only rarely been based expressly on ` opinion ' '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	272	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	273	In this applicant 's application for refugee status I consider that the decisive factor to be taken into account in determining whether or not he was persecuted for a Convention reason is the torture to which he was subjected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	274	I think it is very relevant that in his statement the applicant said at paragraph 10.2 : `` They did many humiliating things to me which I do not want to remember and have difficulty in talking about . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	275	And at paragraph 10.6 : `` They -LSB- the members of the security forces who tortured him -RSB- were nasty , sadistic people who were not educated . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	276	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	277	In Karanakaran v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 3 All ER 449 , 477-479 Sedley LJ said : `` The issues for a decision-maker under the Convention -LRB- whether the decision-maker is a Home Office official , a special adjudicator or the Immigration Appeal Tribunal -RRB- are questions not of hard fact but of evaluation ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	278	Finally , and importantly , the Convention issues from first to last are evaluative not factual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	279	The facts , so far as they can be established , are signposts on the road to a conclusion on the issues : they are not themselves conclusions . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	280	Adopting this approach I consider that in the present case the proper conclusion to draw is that the acts of torture inflicted in such a sub-human way on the applicant were not inflicted solely for the reason of obtaining information to combat Tamil terrorism but were inflicted , at any rate in part , by reason of the torturers ' deep antagonism towards him because he was a Tamil , and the torture was therefore inflicted for reasons of race or membership of a particular social group or political opinion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	281	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	282	In my opinion this conclusion finds support in paragraph 85 of the UNHCR Handbook , although I am in agreement with the view expressed by Dyson LJ , at p 318 , para 26 of his judgment that the last sentence of paragraph 85 goes somewhat too far . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	283	Excessive and arbitrary punishment does not in itself constitute persecution for one of the reasons specified in article 1A of the Geneva Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
52	284	But the fact of excessive and arbitrary punishment may , in the circumstances of a particular case , give rise to the factual inference that a reason for that punishment was the race or membership of a particular social group or political opinion of the victim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	285	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	286	The conclusion that the applicant was tortured because he was a Tamil also finds support in the following propositions in the judgement of Merkel J in Paramananthan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs -LRB- 1998 -RRB- 160 ALR 24 with which I am in respectful agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	287	At p 48 he recognised that in a country : `` such as Sri Lanka which has been torn by war and terrorism resulting from a separatist movement based exclusively on race ... the line between legitimate government counter-terrorist activity -LRB- which is inevitably focused on those of Tamil ethnicity -RRB- and racial and political persecution of Tamils will not be an easy one to draw . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	288	He stated , at p 49 : '' -LRB- 3 -RRB- Although persecution involves the infliction of harm , it implies something more : an element of an attitude on the part of those who persecute which leads to the infliction of harm , or an element of motivation -LRB- however twisted -RRB- for the infliction of harm . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	289	People are persecuted for something perceived about them or attributed to them by their persecutors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	290	Not every isolated act of harm to a person is an act of persecution : Ram v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs -LRB- 1995 -RRB- 57 FCR 565 , 568 ; 130 ALR 314 per Burchett J. -LRB- 4 -RRB- In the context of a country torn by war or terrorism , random acts of violence which occur during civil war and acts done pursuant to laws for the protection of the community in the course of the identification or punishment of criminals or terrorists would not ordinarily be seen as persecution of the individuals affected even though the laws may place additional burdens on the members of a particular race , religion or nationality or social group . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	291	However , law or its enforcement must be appropriately adapted to achieve some legitimate end of government policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	292	A law or its purported enforcement will be persecutory if its real object is not the protection of the public but the oppression of the members of a race , religion , nationality or particular social group or the holders of particular political opinions ... -LRB- 5 -RRB- If measures constituting serious violations of human rights are directed , for example , to members of a particular race , that circumstance may be thought to constitute persecution for the purposes of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	293	As Davies J said in Paramananthan , that is because an inference can be drawn from the excess of the measures taken , the inappropriate violence or detriment in what is done , that the measures involve an intent to inflict harm or penalty for reasons of race , political opinion etc. '' 32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	294	In Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs -LRB- 1997 -RRB- 190 CLR 225 , 258 McHugh J stated : `` The enforcement of a generally applicable criminal law does not ordinarily constitute persecution -LRB- 115 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	295	Nor is the enforcement of laws designed to protect the general welfare of the state ordinarily persecutory even though the laws may place additional burdens on the members of a particular race , religion or nationality or social group . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	296	Thus , a law providing for the detention of the members of a particular race engaged in a civil war may not amount to persecution even though that law affects only members of that race -LRB- 116 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	297	However , where a racial , religious , national group or the holder of a particular political opinion is the subject of sanctions that do not apply generally in the state , it is more likely than not that the application of the sanction is discriminatory and persecutory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	298	It is therefore inherently suspect and requires close scrutiny -LRB- 117 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	299	In cases coming within the categories of race , religion and nationality , decision-makers should ordinarily have little difficulty in determining whether a sanction constitutes persecution of persons in the relevant category . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	300	Only in exceptional cases is it likely that a sanction aimed at persons for reasons of race , religion or nationality will be an appropriate means for achieving a legitimate government object and not amount to persecution . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	301	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	302	As I read that passage there is implicit in it the recognition that it does not follow automatically that sanctions constitute persecution because they do not apply generally in the state -- rather such sanctions are likely to give rise to the factual inference that they constitute persecution where , as McHugh J states , the sanctions are `` aimed at persons for reasons of race , religion or nationality '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	303	I think this point is made expressly in footnote 116 to the passage where McHugh J says : `` It need hardly be said that a law or its purported enforcement will be persecutory if its real object is not the protection of the state but the oppression of the members of a race , religion , nationality or particular social group or the holders of particular political opinions . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	304	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	305	Dyson LJ states , at pp 320-321 , para 30 of his judgment : `` I would hold , therefore , that where a person to whom a political opinion is imputed or who is a member of a race or social group is the subject of sanctions that do not apply generally in the state , then it is more likely than not that the application of the sanctions is discriminatory and persecutory for a Convention reason . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	306	That is where there is a prosecution followed , in the event of conviction , by a sentence imposed by a court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	307	The inference of persecution for a Convention reason is all the stronger where , as in the present case , the sanction is torture by state authorities which is not even lawful by the law of the state concerned . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	308	I agree with this passage provided that it is recognised that what the adjudicator or tribunal or court has to decide on the facts of the individual case is whether the sanctions which do not apply generally in the state are applied to the particular applicant for reasons of race or membership of a particular social group or political opinion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	309	It was apparent from Mr Underwood 's submissions that the Secretary of State was concerned that in the third sentence of the passage Dyson LJ was stating an inference of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	310	I do not consider that he was ; I think that the learned Lord Justice was stating an inference of fact . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	311	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	312	In the present case the special adjudicator stated in his reasons : `` Unpleasant though the consequences were , they were not the result of any political opinions he might have been thought to hold , but of being suspected , however unjustly , of involvement in violent terrorism . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	313	That does not in my view come within the protection of the Convention , and there is nothing else in the evidence to show that he in particular would face persecution if returned to Sri Lanka : it was not argued that northern Tamils in general would do so ; nor should I accept that , for the reasons given at paragraph 2 above .

52	315	I consider that the special adjudicator was entitled to conclude that the applicant was arrested and detained because he was suspected of involvement in violent terrorism . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	316	But I consider that he erred in failing to go on to consider whether the acts of torture to which the applicant was subjected were inflicted by reason of his race or membership of a particular social group or political opinion as a Tamil . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	317	Therefore I consider that Dyson LJ was right to hold , at p 321 , para 31 , of his judgment : `` There is no indication that he approached the matter on the basis that the torture raised an inference that he had been persecuted for a Convention reason . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

52	321	LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
52	322	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	323	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	324	The evidence which my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn has narrated shows all too clearly that members of the security forces tortured the applicant , who is a Tamil from the north of Sri Lanka . 	lord rodger	lord steyn	partagr	0.9	NAN
52	325	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	326	In terms of article 1A of the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees , a refugee must have a `` well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	327	Persecution involves singling people out for ill-treatment and it is accepted that in the present case , when they tortured the applicant , the security forces in Sri Lanka did indeed persecute him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	328	If an applicant is to have the benefit of the Convention , however , the person taking the decision must be satisfied that he has a well-founded fear that he will be persecuted for one or more of the reasons listed in article 1A . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	329	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	330	As has long been recognised , persecutors may act for more than one reason . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	331	Dyson LJ was drawing attention to this when he said , at paragraph 22 of his judgment in the Court of Appeal -LSB- 2001 -RSB- EWCA Civ 1196 ; -LSB- 2002 -RSB- INLR 310 , 317 , that , just because someone had been persecuted for suspected involvement in violent terrorism , it did not follow that he had not been persecuted for his political opinion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	332	In other words , he might have been persecuted for both reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	333	In the next paragraph Dyson LJ identified the task of the person considering a claim for asylum as being `` to assess carefully the real reason for the persecution '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	334	His Lordship was there concerned to make the point that in many cases it is necessary to look below the surface and identify the true reason for any ill-treatment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	335	Of course , there may turn out to be more than one `` real reason '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	336	The evidence may show , for instance , that an applicant was ill-treated both because he belonged to a particular ethnic group and because he was suspected of taking part in terrorist crimes that were the work of members of that ethnic group . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	337	Not only is it often hard to draw the line between legitimate government counter-terrorist activity and racial and political persecution -LRB- Paramananthan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs -LRB- 1998 -RRB- 160 ALR 24 , 48 per Merkel J -RRB- , but indeed members of security forces may act for both legitimate and illegitimate reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	338	In such a case the appropriate inference may be that , if the applicant returned home , he would be ill-treated for a combination of Convention and non-Convention reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	339	If so , the person considering the claim for asylum will properly conclude that the applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution for that combination of reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	340	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	341	In a case like the present the task of the person considering a claim for asylum is therefore to assess carefully the reason or reasons for the persecution in the past and to draw the appropriate inference as to the reason or reasons for any possible persecution in the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	342	There is no rule that , if an applicant is to succeed , the decision-maker must be satisfied that the Convention reason was , or would be , the only reason for his persecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	343	In Suarez v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2002 -RSB- EWCA Civ 722 ; -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 WLR 2663 , 2672 , para 29 Potter LJ said : `` so long as an applicant can establish that one of the motives of his persecutor is a Convention ground and that the applicant 's reasonable fear relates to persecution on that ground , that will be sufficient . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	344	Keene LJ and Sumner J agreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	345	Potter LJ 's guidance is indeed valuable , provided that it is remembered that the law is concerned with the reasons for the persecution and not with the motives of the persecutor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	346	For instance , the law is concerned with whether state officials may persecute someone because he is Jewish , but the motives of those officials for any such persecution - whether a desire to give effect to the theories of racial purity in Hitler 's Mein Kampf or simple jealousy of the prosperity of the Jewish community - are irrelevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	347	So long as the decision-maker is satisfied that one of the reasons why the persecutor ill-treated the applicant was a Convention reason and the applicant 's reasonable fear relates to persecution for that reason , that will be sufficient . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	348	Ex hypothesi any such reason will be an operative reason for the persecution - but , as in the fields of sex and race discrimination , there is little to be gained from dwelling unduly on the precise adjective to use to describe the reason : Nagarajan v London Regional Transport -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 1 AC 501 , 512 - 513 per Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	349	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	350	The person considering an applicant 's claim for asylum must reach his decision by making an assessment in the light of all the available material in the case : Karanakaran v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 3 All ER 449 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	351	In that exercise there is no room for legal presumptions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	352	I would therefore reject any interpretation of paragraph 30 of Dyson LJ 's judgment in this case that suggested that there was . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	353	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	354	The applicant was twice seized by members of the security forces and brutally tortured . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	355	The majority of your Lordships have felt able to attach importance to the very fact that he was subjected to sustained and brutal torture as a factor leading to the conclusion that in 1999 , on a realistic view of the facts , there was a reasonable likelihood of persecution of the applicant for any one of three possible Convention reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	356	I have difficulty , however , in seeing why - in a case such as the present - the use of extreme torture should in itself be a factor pointing to the conclusion that the applicant was , or would be , ill-treated for a Convention reason rather than as part of the security forces ' anti-terrorist operations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	357	Torture can be used for any number of wicked reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	358	When the Gestapo captured British agents dropped into Occupied France during the Second World War , they used extreme methods of torture to try to extract information from the agents about Resistance networks or to try to turn the agents so as to infiltrate those networks . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	359	But the Gestapo did this as part of their fight against the Resistance whom the agents were sent to assist . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
52	360	The Gestapo did not torture the agents because they were British or because they belonged to a particular social group or because of their political opposition to the German occupation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
52	361	Similarly , if members of the security forces in Sri Lanka were barbaric enough to torture their Tamil captives , I see no reason why the correct view should not be that , in some cases at least , they did so as part , albeit an illegitimate part , of their fight against those suspected of involvement in the Tamil Tigers ' terrorist attacks . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
52	362	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
52	363	On the applicant 's own account , after he was picked up at the checkpoint in June 1997 , he was tortured and forced to agree to act as an informer against the Tamil Tigers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
52	364	This was in line with the pattern recorded by the United States State Department that the security forces mistreated detainees `` particularly during investigation '' and that most torture victims were Tamils suspected of being Tamil Tiger insurgents or collaborators . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
52	365	It was on this basis that the special adjudicator concluded that the ill-treatment of the applicant was `` not the result of any political opinions he might have been thought to hold , but of being suspected , however unjustly , of involvement in violent terrorism '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
52	366	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
52	367	That conclusion may well have been right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
52	368	But it is also possible that the security forces ill-treated the applicant for a combination of reasons rather than simply because he was suspected of involvement in violent terrorism . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
52	369	In his statement , which the special adjudicator saw no reason not to accept , the applicant gave a vivid account of being tortured during his first period of detention in 1994 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
52	370	He added that he was `` also '' interrogated and accused of being a member of the Tamil Tigers but , as he saw it , the security forces suspected him more because he was from Jaffna , which was under the Tigers ' control . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
52	371	This leaves open the possibility that the security forces tortured him , in part at least , simply because he was a Tamil from Jaffna and was thought to share the separatist views common among that group . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
52	372	The adjudicator required to consider that possibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
52	373	If I had been satisfied that he had done so , I should not have thought it right to disturb his conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
52	374	As Lord Steyn points out , however , there is nothing in his determination to show that he did . 	lord rodger	lord steyn	partagr	1	NAN
52	375	With some hesitation , I therefore agree that the Immigration Appeal Tribunal should have granted the applicant leave to appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
52	376	46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
52	377	For these reasons I would refuse the appeal and make the order that Lord Steyn proposes . 	lord rodger	self	outcome	1	NAN
