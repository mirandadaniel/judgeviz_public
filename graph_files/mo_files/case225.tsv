225	1	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	2	LORD BINGHAM OF CORNHILL 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	4	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	5	In November 1994 The Sun newspaper published a series of very prominent articles charging the appellant , a well-known premiership goalkeeper , with corruption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	6	He promptly issued writs claiming damages for libel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	7	After some delay caused by an intervening criminal prosecution of the appellant and others , these libel proceedings came before Gray J and a jury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	8	The jury found in favour of the appellant and awarded him compensatory damages of # 85,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	9	On the newspaper 's appeal against this decision the Court of Appeal -LRB- Simon Brown , Thorpe and Jonathan Parker LJJ -RRB- set it aside as perverse and entered judgment for the newspaper : -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 2 All ER 437 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	10	At issue in this appeal to the House is the correctness of the Court of Appeal 's decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	11	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	12	It has been common ground throughout these proceedings that the newspaper 's articles referred to the appellant and were defamatory of him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	13	There has also , unusually , been agreement between the parties on the defamatory meaning borne by the articles complained of . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	14	This meaning , as pleaded by the appellant in his statement of claim and admitted by the newspaper in its defence , was that the appellant '' -LRB- a -RRB- having dishonestly taken bribes had fixed or attempted to fix the result of games of football in which he had played and -LRB- b -RRB- had dishonestly taken bribes with a view to fixing the result of games in which he would be playing . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	15	This compendious statement , on which the conduct of the proceedings by both parties has necessarily turned , expresses two linked but separate allegations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	16	The first is that , having dishonestly taken bribes , he had actually fixed or attempted to fix -LRB- ie deliberately lost or attempted to lose -RRB- games of football in which he had -LRB- in the past -RRB- played . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	17	The second is that the appellant had dishonestly accepted bribes with a view to fixing -LRB- ie deliberately losing -RRB- games of football in which he would -LRB- in future -RRB- be playing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	18	I shall in this opinion use the expression `` fix '' to mean `` deliberately lose '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	19	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	20	The appellant 's case at trial was that he had never dishonestly accepted any bribe , had never made a corrupt agreement to fix or attempt to fix any game of football and had never in fact fixed or attempted to fix any game . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	21	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	22	The burden of justifying the agreed defamatory meaning of the words published lay , as in any libel action , on the publisher of the words , here the newspaper -LRB- and its editor , whose position calls for no separate consideration -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	23	But the trial judge correctly directed the jury that the newspaper did not have to prove the truth of every sentence or paragraph of the articles it published , and he continued : `` What The Sun has to do in order to succeed with this defence is to establish the substantial truth of the defamatory charges or accusations published about Mr Grobbelaar . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	24	That is why I drew your attention a moment ago to what the admitted defamatory meanings of the articles are . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	25	It is the substantial truth of those defamatory meanings which The Sun has to prove to be true . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	26	In other words , the The Sun has to satisfy you of the substantial truth of the message that Mr Grobbelaar dishonestly took bribes and fixed or attempted to fix matches , those being the meanings which , as I have told you , are agreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	27	What that means , members of the jury , is that you must be satisfied by the evidence that the dishonest taking of bribes to fix the outcome of matches was something that Mr Grobbelaar did or at least was prepared to do or to try to do . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	28	As I say , the defence will not fail because you are not satisfied that the defendants have proved every alleged incident of dishonest bribery or every meeting or conversation on which they rely , provided that they have proved to your satisfaction sufficient -LSB- incidents -RSB- on or off the pitch for you to conclude that the charge against Mr Grobbelaar in those articles is substantially justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	29	Let me just expand a little further on what I mean by substantial justification or substantial truth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	30	Suppose -LRB- and it is just a hypothesis to help you -RRB- you were to conclude that Mr Grobbelaar did indeed agree to take bribes and took bribes from the short man and later on agreed to take bribes and took a bribe from Mr Vincent but that for one reason or another he did not actually do anything in any match by way of attempting to fix the result by deliberately letting in goals ; just suppose that was your conclusion on the evidence ; but then you would want to stand back and ask yourselves : ` Are we satisfied , having arrived at that conclusion , that what was published about Mr Grobbelaar was substantially true ? ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	31	The arguments might then be this : Mr Hartley -LSB- counsel for Mr Grobbelaar -RSB- might say , and indeed has said , that if there was no match that was actually fixed , that Mr Grobbelaar did not let in any goal deliberately , then that is a fatal flaw , says Mr Hartley , in the defence of justification and it should fail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	32	Not so , says Mr Carman -LSB- counsel for the newspaper -RSB- ; if it is established by the defendants that there were corrupt agreements then the sting of the articles is justified and the defence of justification should not fail , says Mr Carman , because the defendants can not point to a particular match where there was any goal deliberately let in . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	33	I hope that helps you on what is meant by ` substantial truth ' and of course it is your province ; you are the people who decide whether the substantial truth of the article has been made out . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	34	Towards the end of his jury direction the judge turned to the issue of damages , which he related to the issue of substantial justification : `` But there is one important rider that I want to add , members of the jury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	35	It is this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	36	Supposing you were to come to the conclusion that you were not satisfied that the articles are substantially justified in the sense that I have explained to you , so that the plea of justification does not actually succeed , but you were to conclude that the defendants have proved a significant part of their case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	37	For example , suppose , and this is just an example to try and illustrate the principle that I am trying to explain , you were to conclude that The Sun have proved the willingness of Mr Grobbelaar to enter into a corrupt agreement with Mr Vincent to fix matches -LSB- for -RSB- # 2,000 a fortnight , or whatever it was , but you are not satisfied on the evidence that there was any corrupt agreement with the short man . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	38	Just suppose you come to that conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	39	Well , you might think : Well , here is a man who has , on our view of the evidence , been shown to have entered into a corrupt conspiracy , the one with Vincent , although not the one with the short man . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	40	Now , that , too , can be reflected in your award of damages , because you might in that situation feel it appropriate to reduce any award you might otherwise make quite significantly to reflect the fact that in good part what was published was true . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	41	So , that would be a reason for reducing perhaps - it is a matter for you - very , very significantly any amount of damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
225	42	But , of course , if you decide that the articles are substantially justified then of course you do not get to damages at all , so this is just an example to help you understand the way it works . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	43	In accordance with the modern practice the judge made reference , for purposes of comparison , to prevailing levels of personal injury damages and gave the jury some assistance on the bracket within which , depending on its findings , damages -LRB- if awarded at all -RRB- might fall : `` At the top end in a case of this kind you might think that an award of # 150,000 , something of that order , might be justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	44	At the lower end - but it all depends , really , on your view of the evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	45	If you were to conclude that this is a case where a significant part of the defence of justification has been made good even if the defence does not succeed , then you might want to come up with a very small award indeed , I do not know . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	46	So the lower end of the bracket comes quite low if you feel that to a significant extent the case has been proved against Mr Grobbelaar . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	47	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	48	Before all the courts seised of this case it has been forcefully argued on behalf of the newspaper that the sting of the articles published lay in their very clear accusation that the appellant had corruptly agreed to fix and had accepted payment for fixing matches and that whether he had actually fixed matches or attempted to do so was a matter of relatively minor significance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	49	In argument before the House , the first extract from the judge 's jury direction quoted in the preceding paragraph was criticised by the newspaper for its failure to put the newspaper 's version of the sting to the jury as the true and only sting . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	50	The Court of Appeal , I think , treated the newspaper 's version of the sting in this way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	51	I would for my part accept , without hesitation , that the newspaper 's version of the sting could well be understood as expressing the real thrust of the articles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	52	It is unnecessary to recite extracts from the articles themselves to make good that proposition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	53	They were replete with references to corrupt agreements allegedly made by the appellant and to his corrupt acceptance of money . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	54	The judge would certainly have been wrong not to leave this version to the jury and a reasonable jury could well have accepted it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	55	But the judge was also right to leave the appellant 's version of the sting to the jury for its consideration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	56	It is again unnecessary to make detailed reference to the articles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	57	On the first day of publication on this subject the newspaper 's headline on its front page was `` GROBBELAAR TOOK BRIBES TO FIX GAMES '' and its first paragraph read : `` Soccer star Bruce Grobbelaar is exposed by The Sun today for taking massive bribes to throw key matches . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	58	On page 2 of the same issue its headline read `` GROB I let in 3 goals and picked up # 40,000 '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	59	So the articles continued , with references , cartoons and jokes suggesting that the appellant had fixed matches , let in goals deliberately , saved goals by mistake and deliberately dropped the ball . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	60	A reasonable jury could well have accepted the appellant 's version of the sting as expressing the real thrust of the articles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	61	A reader of The Sun would no doubt be very shocked to learn that a professional footballer of the appellant 's standing had corruptly agreed to fix matches and had accepted bribes to do so , but might well be even more deeply horrified to learn that a professional footballer of the appellant 's standing had let down his team-mates , betrayed his club , blackened the name of English football and made fools of those who spent good money on watching what they took to be a genuine contest by fixing or attempting to fix matches in which he appeared . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	62	It could well be that the average reader of the newspaper , having read the articles complained of with the degree of attention many readers would give them , if asked a month later what they knew of the appellant , would remember him as the premiership goalkeeper who had deliberately let in goals for money . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	63	It is not for the House to choose between these competing versions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	64	The choice was one to be made by the jury to which , pursuant to section 69 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- of the Supreme Court Act 1981 , the decision of such questions was committed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	65	It was open to the jury to choose either version . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	66	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	67	The second extract from the judge 's direction quoted in paragraph 4 above was also criticised by the newspaper , on the ground that it was not the case of either party that the appellant might have made one of the corrupt agreements alleged against him but not the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	68	I would reject that criticism also . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	69	The judge made it plain that he was giving an example to illustrate the relevant principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	70	The jury was not bound by the parties ' views on the facts , provided there was evidence to support the view it took . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	71	And it would not in my opinion have been necessarily irrational or perverse to be satisfied about one of the two agreements but entertain doubts about the facts relating to the other -LRB- see paragraph 20 below -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	72	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	73	How , then , is the jury 's verdict to be understood ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	74	All that is known for certain is that the jury found for the appellant , awarded him damages of # 85,000 and did not award any sum by way of exemplary damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	75	The oracular utterance of the jury contains no reasoning , no elaboration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	76	But it is not immune from review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	77	The jury is a judicial decision-maker of a very special kind , but it is a judicial decision-maker nonetheless . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	78	While speculation about the jury 's reasoning and train of thought is impermissible , the drawing of inevitable or proper inferences from the jury 's decision is not , and is indeed inherent in the process of review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	79	Thus it may be stated with certainty that the jury found that the newspaper had failed to justify , to the required standard , whatever it found the sting of the articles to be . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	80	There are two possibilities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	81	Either the jury accepted the newspaper 's version of the sting and found that the newspaper had failed to justify it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	82	Or it accepted the appellant 's version of the sting and found the newspaper had failed to justify that . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	83	Assuming that the members of the jury endeavoured to follow the judge 's direction , there is no third possibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	84	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	85	Before the strengths and weaknesses of these two possible interpretations are considered , some reference must be made to the facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	86	This may be done with extreme brevity since the background facts , the evidence and the history of these proceedings have been summarised with great thoroughness and accuracy by the Court of Appeal : see the judgment of Simon Brown LJ at -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 2 All ER 437 , pp 440-443 , paras 4-22 and pp 452-457 , paras 57-78 ; and the judgment of Jonathan Parker LJ , pp 467-482 , paras 118-194 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	87	This opinion assumes that that material has been assimilated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	88	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	89	On 6 September 1994 Mr Christopher Vincent contacted The Sun . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	90	He was described by the judge as `` a thoroughly dishonest con-man '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	91	He was a native of Zimbabwe , where the appellant had been brought up , and they had formerly been associates in a business venture which had failed and caused considerable loss to the appellant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	92	Mr Vincent had given evidence at both the criminal trials of the appellant , but he was not called by the newspaper at this trial because he was regarded by the newspaper as a wholly unreliable witness whose evidence might be highly suspect and whose whole character might be deeply flawed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	93	Mr Vincent told the newspaper that the appellant had been acting corruptly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	94	The newspaper armed Mr Vincent with equipment to record future exchanges between himself and the appellant with a view to obtaining evidence of the appellant 's corrupt behaviour . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	95	The first meeting between Mr Vincent and the appellant after this date was on 12 September 1994 at the Swallow Hotel , Waltham Abbey . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	96	On this occasion the recording equipment failed to function and so the only evidence of the conversation which took place was the appellant 's . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	97	He said that Mr Vincent had made a corrupt suggestion which he had rejected , before beginning to wonder what Mr Vincent was up to . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	98	A second meeting took place on 6 October 1994 at the De Vere Grand Hotel in Southampton . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	99	To begin with , the appellant and Mr Vincent played snooker together and their conversation at that stage was not recorded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	100	They then went to Mr Vincent 's bedroom where their conversation was recorded and video-taped . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	101	A further meeting in the same room , again recorded and video-taped , followed on 25 October 1994 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	102	A fourth meeting , recorded and video-taped , took place on 3 November 1994 in a flat at Osborne House , Southampton . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	103	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	104	The authenticity of the audio and video tapes obtained by the newspaper of these meetings between the appellant and Mr Vincent was not challenged at the trial , and in seeking to justify what had been published in the articles the newspaper very largely relied on what the appellant had himself said . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	105	During the course of the meetings Mr Vincent put corrupt proposals to the appellant who responded positively to them and also stated that he had acted corruptly in the past . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	106	At the last of the meetings , on 3 November 1994 , the appellant received # 2,000 in cash in an envelope from Mr Vincent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	107	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	108	Knowledge of events before the appellant 's first meeting with Mr Vincent on 12 September 1994 derives almost entirely from what the appellant is recorded as saying on the tapes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	109	In November 1992 the appellant had been introduced by Mr John Fashanu , another football star , to Mr Richard Lim , usually referred to as `` the short man '' , who was said to be the front man of a Far Eastern syndicate betting on English football . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	110	According to the appellant 's evidence at trial he at first agreed to forecast the result of matches for Mr Lim , but later provided information instead , for which services he had received some # 8,000 in cash . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	111	On 30 September 1993 the appellant and Mr Vincent had driven together from Chester to the Hilton Hotel at Manchester International Airport where the appellant received # 1,000 or # 1,500 in cash from Mr Lim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	112	On 21 November 1993 Liverpool , the appellant 's club , lost 0-3 to Newcastle at home . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	113	According to the appellant 's statements on the tapes , Mr Lim had asked the appellant to fix this game and had paid him # 40,000 for his services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	114	Despite a headline in one of the articles clearly suggesting that he had let in three goals and had received # 40,000 , however , the newspaper did not allege in its defence that the appellant had deliberately let in any of those goals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	115	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	116	On 25 November 1993 the appellant and Mr Vincent visited Mr Fashanu at his home and it was then , the newspaper contended , that payment was made for the Newcastle result . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	117	The appellant accepted that during November 1993 he paid Mr Vincent # 20,000 in cash , partly in payment of a bill but largely as a deposit on a development scheme in Zimbabwe , and also admitted that he had paid # 5,000 into his testimonial fund on 26 November 1993 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	118	The timing of the # 20,000 payment and the origin of these monies was disputed between the parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	119	The appellant said that the cash was drawn from a store of cash which he kept in his sock drawer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	120	His habit of keeping cash in that drawer , and the payment of a substantial sum out of it , were corroborated by the appellant 's wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN

225	122	On 4 January 1994 Liverpool played Manchester United at home and drew 3-3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	123	The newspaper , basing itself on the tapes , contended that if Liverpool had lost that match the appellant would have received # 125,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	124	The newspaper did not allege in its defence that any of the three goals scored by Manchester United were deliberately let in by the appellant but did contend that he had made two `` blinding saves '' accidentally . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
225	125	On 4 February 1994 the appellant was staying in the team hotel in Norwich and on the eve of Liverpool 's match against Norwich the following day , in breach of club rules , he drove with Mr Vincent to London where he met Mr Lim and received # 1,500 before returning to Norwich in the small hours of the next day .

225	126	In the match against Norwich , Liverpool drew 2-2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN

225	132	In a match against Coventry on 24 September 1994 , after the appellant 's first -LRB- unrecorded -RRB- meeting with Mr Vincent at the Swallow Hotel , Southampton won 3-1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	133	Relying on what the appellant later said on the tapes , the newspaper contended that the Coventry goal had been scored when the appellant had pushed the ball into the back of the net . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	134	Southampton 's next match mentioned in the evidence was played away against Manchester City on 5 November 1994 , two days after the appellant 's last meeting with Mr Vincent at which he had received # 2,000 in cash , and was drawn 3-3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN

225	137	On 8 November 1994 the appellant was due to fly from Gatwick Airport to Zimbabwe . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	138	Shortly before that date Mr Vincent telephoned him to suggest that they should meet at the airport , so that he -LRB- Vincent -RRB- could give the appellant his next # 2,000 instalment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	139	This was , it seems , agreed , but when the appellant arrived at the airport he was instead confronted by a posse of journalists who -LRB- as Jonathan Parker LJ put it -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 2 All ER 437 at 480 , para 184 -RRB- `` bombarded him with questions and accusations '' .

225	143	There can be no doubt but that the appellant 's statements recorded on the tapes , if accepted as wholly true , were very clear evidence of a corrupt agreement between him and Mr Lim , of the corrupt receipt of money by him from Mr Lim , of a corrupt agreement between him and Mr Vincent , of the corrupt receipt of money by him from Mr Vincent and of his deliberately fixing or attempting to fix matches .

225	146	In describing his dealings with Mr Lim to Mr Vincent , as he had , he had been seeking to earn Mr Vincent 's confidence and trust , as part of an overall scheme to discover the identity of those who were behind Mr Vincent and gain evidence of their corrupt activities with a view to exposing both him and them to the appropriate authorities in this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	147	His suggestions that he had deliberately let in goals were untrue and were , again , made to earn the trust and confidence of Mr Vincent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	148	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	149	In thus seeking to explain away his apparently incriminating statements , the appellant faced certain formidable difficulties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	150	Most formidable of all is the content of the tapes themselves . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	151	Transcribed , these tapes run to over 50 pages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	152	Some of the conversation recorded is personal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	153	Some relates to the parties ' business ventures . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	154	But much is devoted to discussing and working out the terms of the corrupt bargain which Mr Vincent was offering to the appellant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	155	In these passages the appellant shows himself ready enough to deal , but anxious about the risk of exposure and concerned to plan his response if the facts came to light . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	156	He makes no more than a half-hearted attempt to discover the names of Mr Vincent 's backers , apparently keener to conceal his own identity than discover theirs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	157	I do not think any reasonable juror , hearing or reading this material , could have concluded that the appellant 's making of a corrupt bargain with Mr Vincent and his acceptance of money from him could have been a pretence on his part . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	158	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	159	Allowance must of course be made for the immense advantage enjoyed by the jury in hearing the appellant give his evidence , both when examined by his counsel Mr Hartley QC and when cross-examined by the late Mr Carman QC for the newspaper . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	160	But even if the appellant 's account , standing alone , were treated as plausible , his difficulties do not end . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	161	In his pleaded reply in these proceedings the appellant denied the existence of `` the short man '' , who was said to be a figment of his own imagination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	162	This lie , which remained uncorrected for three years , was attributed by the appellant to his concern that his forecasting arrangement with Mr Lim might be contrary to the rules of the Football Association . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	163	Also in his reply the appellant denied that there had been a meeting with Mr Fashanu on 25 November 1993 , a lie for which he was unable at the trial to offer any explanation at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	164	Again , the appellant in his reply denied that he had visited London with Mr Vincent on the eve of Liverpool 's match against Norwich , a lie which he attributed to his concern that his breach of club discipline should not become known . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	165	The appellant 's difficulties do not even end there . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	166	During the period of his meetings with Mr Vincent he made no mention to anyone of his plan to obtain evidence of wrongdoing so as to expose Mr Vincent and his backers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	167	When he received payment of # 2,000 in cash he did not take or report it to the authorities but instead -LRB- according to him -RRB- put it in the glove compartment of the car , intending to make disclosure after his receipt of the second instalment and on his return from Zimbabwe . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	168	When confronted at the airport his initial reaction was to challenge the reporters to prove their allegations and to resort to half-truths . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	169	Even in his conversation with the editor he gave no more than a passing hint of what was , at the trial , to be the bedrock of his case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	170	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	171	In his exchanges with the reporters at the airport and with the editor , the appellant was emphatic -LRB- as he was in evidence at the trial -RRB- that he had never fixed or attempted to fix a match . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	172	That assertion conflicted with what the appellant was recorded on the tapes as saying about the five matches mentioned above . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	173	In his evidence at the trial he again testified that he had never fixed or attempted to fix a match . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	174	His evidence might not , without more , carry great weight , since his credibility was at best questionable and he was vulnerable to the suggestion that a professional footballer would not make such admissions , gravely damaging to himself , unless they were true . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	175	But there was no extraneous evidence to support the truth of the appellant 's admissions and there was in this instance strong evidence to show their untruth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	176	For there were videos , played before the jury , showing all the instances in which the appellant had claimed to have made , or tried to make , goalkeeping errors and there was expert evidence strongly supportive of the appellant 's evidence from Mr Bob Wilson , formerly a professional goalkeeper of the highest standing , and Mr Alan Ball , formerly a professional footballer of renown who had been the appellant 's manager at Southampton . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	177	Mr Wilson saw no evidence of anything other than good -LRB- and on occasion outstanding -RRB- goalkeeping in any of the five games . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	178	Mr Ball saw nothing odd or suspicious in the appellant 's play in either of the two Southampton games , both of which he had watched . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	179	The newspaper called no evidence to contradict that adduced by the appellant , but instead accepted -LRB- as noted above -RRB- that in four of the five games in question the appellant had not deliberately let in any goals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	180	Of the Coventry match , in which the appellant said he had pushed the ball into the back of the net , Mr Wilson 's opinion was that a goalkeeper less agile than the appellant would not possibly have touched the ball at all and that the appellant had made every attempt to save it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	181	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	182	Consideration may now be given to the two possible interpretations of the jury 's verdict identified in paragraph 7 above : first , that the jury accepted the newspaper 's version of the sting of the articles and found that the newspaper had failed to justify it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	183	It was this interpretation which was accepted in the Court of Appeal , with the agreement or acquiescence of Mr Hartley , as the correct interpretation of the verdict . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	184	Simon Brown LJ referred to this in paragraph 23 -LRB- p 443 -RRB- of his judgment , and again in paragraph 80 -LRB- p 458 -RRB- where he said '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	185	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	186	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	187	the jury 's verdict is accepted on all sides to be consistent only with their having found Mr Grobbelaar innocent -LRB- or rather not proved on the balance of probabilities guilty -RRB- of all corruption , guilty merely of subsequent lies . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	188	Thorpe LJ also referred to it in paragraph 115 -LRB- p 466 -RRB- , and Jonathan Parker LJ in paragraph 219 -LRB- p 487 -RRB- : `` Mr Hartley concedes that in awarding damages of # 85,000 the jury must have been satisfied not only that no actual match-fixing had taken place -LRB- ie that Mr Grobbelaar had not deliberately let in any goals in the matches in question -RRB- , but also that he had not been party to any corrupt arrangement , either with Mr Lim or with Mr Vincent : in other words , that none of the charges made against him by the Sun had been proved . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	189	It was this blanket exoneration of the appellant which the Court of Appeal found to be irreconcilable with the evidence before the jury and so perverse . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	190	If this is the correct interpretation of the jury 's verdict I should be compelled to share the Court of Appeal 's conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	191	As Simon Brown LJ put it -LRB- p 461 , para 92 -RRB- : '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN

225	193	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	194	one is left with an inescapable core of fact and circumstance which to my mind leads inexorably to the view that Mr Grobbelaar 's story is , quite simply , incredible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	195	All logic , common sense and reason compel one to that conclusion . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	196	On all the evidence it defies reason to accept that the appellant did not make a corrupt agreement with Mr Vincent and accept a bribe from him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	197	In relation to Mr Lim , the position is possibly less clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	198	The tapes contain apparently clear admissions of a corrupt agreement and the acceptance of bribes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	199	But the appellant 's fixing and attempted fixing of matches was said to have been done in pursuance of that agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	200	If the jury concluded that the appellant had not been shown to have fixed or attempted to fix matches , it could perhaps have felt some doubt about the agreement itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	201	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	202	Only rarely , and with extreme caution , will the House permit counsel to withdraw from a concession which has formed the basis of argument and judgment in the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	203	But Mr Hartley has sought the leave of the House to do so , and I would , exceptionally , permit him to do so for two reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	204	First , it is a very serious thing to stigmatise as perverse the unanimous finding of jurors who have solemnly sworn to return a true verdict according to the evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	205	A jury may , of course , from time to time act in a wholly irrational way , but that is not a conclusion to be reached lightly or if any alternative explanation not involving perversity presents itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	206	Secondly , the common position of counsel on this issue was , although for quite different reasons , dictated by their respective forensic positions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	207	Mr Hartley represented a client who had faced two criminal charges . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	208	He had been acquitted of one and two juries had been unable to agree on the other , leading to his discharge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
225	209	He had pursued these libel proceedings in the hope of salvaging his reputation after a highly publicised attack upon it in the newspaper and elsewhere . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	210	At the end of the trial he had won the jury 's verdict and recovered what was , by any standards , a substantial award of damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	211	Counsel representing the appellant was bound , in his client 's interests , to portray this outcome as a complete vindication of his client 's reputation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	212	To have portrayed the result as anything other than complete vindication could scarcely have reflected the client 's wishes or indeed his instructions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	213	But , curiously , it served the newspaper 's turn to portray the verdict in the same way , for the more complete the jury 's exoneration of the appellant was taken to be , the more susceptible to challenge , given the weight of the evidence against him on the Vincent agreement , the jury 's verdict would be . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	214	So it served what both sides understandably saw as their interests to put the same case on this point to the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	215	This unusual situation in my opinion provides additional ground for considering whether any alternative , and preferable , explanation of the verdict exists . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	216	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	217	The alternative explanation , as expressed in paragraph 7 above , is that the jury accepted the appellant 's version of the sting and found that the newspaper had failed to justify it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	218	This version , it will be recalled , is directed to the appellant 's conduct in actually fixing or attempting to fix matches . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	219	If the jury found this to be the true sting of the articles , its finding in favour of the appellant is explicable , since the jury could not on the evidence have found that the newspaper had justified it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	220	It is plain from the urgency of Mr Carman 's submissions to the judge in the absence of the jury that he , as one would expect , fully appreciated the vulnerability of the newspaper if the appellant 's version of the sting were to be accepted as the true sting of the articles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	221	But for one feature of the jury 's decision , it would seem very probable that the jury , as it was entitled to do , accepted the appellant 's version of the sting and found for him accordingly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	222	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	223	That feature is the award of # 85,000 compensatory damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	224	That is a substantial award and the newspaper relied on it to contend that the jury must have found that no corrupt act had been established against the appellant , even on the balance of probabilities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	225	Mr Hartley suggested that the jury , basing itself on the maximum figure indicated by the judge , had discounted that figure because of the lies admittedly told by the appellant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	226	Both contentions raise problems . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	227	Acceptance of the newspaper 's contention requires acceptance that the jury acted perversely , a conclusion one is reluctant to reach unless driven to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	228	But the appellant 's explanation is unpersuasive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	229	If the jury found that no corruption had been proved against the appellant , it must have accepted his evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	230	If it accepted his evidence on the main issues it would be surprising if his explanation of his lies about the existence of Mr Lim and the trip from Norwich to London had not been accepted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	231	The appellant 's lie about the visit to Mr Fashanu 's house would remain unexplained , but would -LRB- if no corruption were found proved against the appellant -RRB- have been a motiveless and somewhat irrelevant lie , not meriting any substantial reduction of damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	232	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	233	It seems to me safe to infer 1 -RRB- that the jury accepted the appellant 's version of the sting of the articles , as the judge had directed was open to it ; 2 -RRB- that the jury found that the sting had not been justified , as on the evidence it had plainly not ; and 3 -RRB- that the jury found that the appellant had made a corrupt agreement with and corruptly accepted money from Mr Vincent , as it would have been perverse to do otherwise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	234	The question then arises whether on that basis the jury 's award of damages can be upheld . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	235	The jury will have had in mind the newspaper 's banner headline on the front page of its first issue devoted to this topic and the similar headline on page 2 , quoted in paragraph 5 above . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	236	The jury may well have held it against the newspaper that this allegation of match-fixing and attempted match-fixing was persisted in and never withdrawn despite the lack of extraneous evidence to support it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	237	The ambush of the appellant at the airport may have been seen as oppressive , the weight of the newspaper 's journalistic onslaught as excessive and the newspaper 's attempt to involve the appellant 's children as offensive -LRB- `` How much of what 's been happening have you told the children about ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	238	Have they been getting a hard time at school as the result of the allegations against you ? '' -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	239	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	240	The jury 's generosity towards the appellant is perhaps understandable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	241	But it can not be supported . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	242	The tort of defamation protects those whose reputations have been unlawfully injured . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	243	It affords little or no protection to those who have , or deserve to have , no reputation deserving of legal protection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	244	Until 9 November 1994 when the newspaper published its first articles about him , the appellant 's public reputation was unblemished . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	245	But he had in fact acted in a way in which no decent or honest footballer would act and in a way which could , if not exposed and stamped on , undermine the integrity of a game which earns the loyalty and support of millions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	246	Even if the newspaper had published no more than what , on my interpretation of the jury 's verdict , it was entitled to have published , the appellant would have been shown to have acted in a way which any right-thinking person would unequivocally condemn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	247	It would be an affront to justice if a court of law were to award substantial damages to a man shown to have acted in such flagrant breach of his legal and moral obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	248	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	249	The newspaper contended in its written case that the power conferred on the Court of Appeal by section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 , to substitute for a sum of damages awarded by a jury such sum as appeared to the court to be proper instead of ordering a new trial , is a power exercisable only by the Court of Appeal and not by the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	250	Reliance was placed on the express reference in the subsection to the Court of Appeal , to the definition of `` Court of Appeal '' in section 5 of and Schedule 1 to the Interpretation Act 1978 and to the language of CPR Part 52.10 -LRB- 3 -RRB- , which reflects the terms of section 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	251	My Lords I regard this contention as misconceived . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	252	By section 4 of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 it is provided that the House may , on an appeal to it , `` determine what of right , and according to the law and custom of this realm , ought to be done in the subject-matter of such appeal '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	253	A petition to the House routinely asks , as does that of the appellant , that the order of the Court of Appeal `` may be reviewed by Her Majesty the Queen , in Her Court of Parliament , and that the said Order may be reversed , varied or altered or that your Petitioner may have such other relief in the premises as to Her Majesty the Queen , in Her Court of Parliament , may seem meet '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	254	The House is not , like the Court of Appeal , a creature of statute , and in the absence of statutory or judicial restriction has inherent power to exercise any power vested in the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	255	In his article `` The Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court '' -LRB- 1970 -RRB- 23 Current Legal Problems 23 , Jacob was largely concerned with the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court , and the procedural aspects of that jurisdiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	256	But he propounded -LRB- page 51 -RRB- a definition which has never perhaps been bettered : '' ... the inherent jurisdiction of the court may be defined as being the reserve or fund of powers , a residual source of powers , which the court may draw upon as necessary whenever it is just or equitable to do so , and in particular to ensure the observance of the due process of law , to prevent improper vexation or oppression , to do justice between the parties and to secure a fair trial between them '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	257	It would be strange indeed if the House , having jurisdiction to entertain the appellant 's appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal , did not have power to substitute the order which it concludes the Court of Appeal should have made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	258	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	259	If the jury 's finding in favour of the appellant could not be explained on any ground not indicative of perversity , the Court of Appeal would have been not only entitled but bound to quash it , and the contrary was not argued . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	260	But the task of an appellate court , whether the Court of Appeal or the House , is to seek to interpret the jury 's decision and not , because of justifiable dissatisfaction at the outcome , to take upon itself the determination of factual issues which lay within the exclusive province of the jury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	261	In its approach to the quantum of damages the jury fell into serious error , failing to respond to the steer which the trial judge had given , and its award can not be supported . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	262	But that was not a perverse error and to conclude , on the evidence and the judge 's direction , that the jury must have acted perversely in making the finding it did is not in my opinion justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	263	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	264	For the foregoing reasons , I would quash the Court of Appeal 's decision and restore the first instance finding in favour of the appellant . 	lord bingham	self	outcome	0.3	NAN
225	265	I would however quash the jury 's award of damages and substitute an award of # 1 nominal damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	266	The appellant is entitled to protection against repetition of the allegation that he actually fixed or attempted to fix matches , and I would give him leave to apply to the High Court for the grant of a suitably-worded injunction limited to restraining the publication of words which mean or could reasonably be understood to mean that he had fixed or attempted to fix matches and extending no further , unless a suitable undertaking is offered .

225	273	After a comprehensive and careful analysis of the facts the Court of Appeal came to the conclusion that the jury verdict of # 85,000 in favour of Mr Bruce Grobbelaar was an affront to justice and had to be quashed : Grobbelaar v News Group Newspapers Ltd -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 2 All ER 437 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	274	While the members of the Court of Appeal were reluctant to find that a jury verdict was perverse , they concluded that Mr Grobbelaar 's case stretched credulity beyond breaking point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	275	It was therefore one of those rare cases where a jury verdict had to be quashed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	276	To allow Mr Grobbelaar to retain a wholly unmerited award of damages would have been wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	277	That is how the Court of Appeal reasoned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	278	Disagreeing with the other members of the Appellate Committee , I am in full accord with the conclusion and reasons of the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	279	Having unquestionably conspired , with two different fraudsters , in return for bribes , to attempt to fix football matches , it is an unjust result , in the circumstances of this case , to affirm a verdict on liability in favour of Mr Grobbelaar . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
225	280	By recovering only derisory damages Mr Grobbelaar has , of course , effectively lost his action to clear his name . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

225	292	The Sun published its exposé of Mr Grobbelaar 's conduct over the next eight days under banner headlines to the effect that `` Grobbelaar took bribes to fix games '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	293	Football is the national sport and there was enormous public interest in the story . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	294	In the Sun there was saturation coverage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	295	The recurring theme of the reports , based on the tapes , was that Mr Grobbelaar took bribes to fix football matches and also deliberately let in goals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	296	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	297	Mr Grobbelaar sued for damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	298	The trial of the civil case had to await the conclusion of criminal proceedings against him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	299	Those proceedings did not result in his conviction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	300	In July 1999 Mr Justice Gray and a jury heard the libel action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	301	Mr Grobbelaar called two football experts who testified that video evidence of five games did not show that he let in any goals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	302	As against this there was before the jury the tapes which cumulatively demonstrated the corrupt dealings of Mr Grobbelaar . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	303	Gray J directed the jury correctly on all points of law and reviewed the background and issues in a fair and balanced way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	304	In his summing up the judge left it open to the jury to consider , if they concluded that no match fixing had been established , but they were satisfied that one or two corrupt agreements were made , to find for the Sun on substantial justification or to reduce Mr Grobbelaar 's damages to a nominal sum . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	305	This is the context in which the jury returned a verdict in favour of Mr Grobbelaar and awarded him # 85,000 damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	306	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	307	In the Court of Appeal Lord Justice Simon Brown recorded that `` it was common ground before us that the award of # 85,000 was consistent only with the jury having rejected the defence of justification in respect of both alleged conspiracies - i.e. both the corrupt agreement with Mr Lim in the past and that with Mr Vincent for the future '' : para 23 ; see also paras 115 & 219 of the other judgments of Thorpe LJ and Jonathan Parker LJ . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	308	This reflected the considered position of both parties which had crystallised before the oral hearing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	309	Clearly , each member of the Court of Appeal regarded this inference as the most plausible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	310	Given this agreed interpretation of the jury verdict the members of the Court of Appeal judgments did not need to explain their reasons for accepting this position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	311	This also explains the structure of the judgments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	312	On appeal to the House counsel argued that the Court of Appeal erred in the following respects : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LSB- The agreed interpretation -RSB- overlooks the possibility that the jury may have gone wrong in assessing the separate question of damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	313	-LRB- 2 -RRB- It does not follow that another jury might not also find for the appellant but award a lesser sum of damages . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	314	I would hesitate long and hard before accepting such a new interpretation which is plainly inspired by tactical considerations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	315	In any event , the agreed basis placed before the Court of Appeal is in my view the most likely explanation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	316	The jury must have accepted the argument advanced on behalf of Mr Grobbelaar at trial that , since he let in no goals , his explanation that during the taped interviews he was merely trying to trap Mr Vincent , was probably also true . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	317	Counsel for Mr Grobbelaar observed to the Court of Appeal that the reduction of the damages from a substantially higher figure mentioned by the judge was in recognition of the lies told by Mr Grobbelaar : para 23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	318	The heavy concentration at trial on the expert evidence caused the jury to take their eye off the forensic ball . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	319	It is inappropriate therefore to depart from the agreed basis put before the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	320	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	321	On the agreed interpretation of the jury verdict , the next question is whether the Court of Appeal was correct to find that the jury verdict was perverse . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	322	Like the members of the Court of Appeal I am satisfied that both conspiracies were established . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	323	The roles of Mr Grobbelaar , Mr Lim and Mr Vincent were interwoven . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	324	The conspiracy with Mr Vincent was established beyond rational argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	325	The conspiracy with Mr Lim did not solely depend on Mr Grobbelaar 's admissions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	326	As counsel for the Sun demonstrated there was ample corroboration and confirmation of this conspiracy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	327	The jig-saw is complete : both conspiracies were proved with compelling clarity and certainty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	328	The consequence of this conclusion was summarised by Thorpe LJ as follows -LRB- para 106 -RRB- : '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

225	331	Any agreement to accept a bribe constitutes an actionable tort as well as a criminal offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	332	As Mr Spearman demonstrated in reply an agreement to receive a bribe constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty and it is no defence to prove that the recipient was not influenced to depart or did not depart from his duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	333	Equally in crime the burden on the prosecution is only to prove receipt of the bribe and it is no defence for the recipient to show that he did not intend to keep his side of the dishonest bargain . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	334	The jury 's complete exoneration of Mr Grobbelaar was perverse . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	335	The verdict had to be quashed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	336	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	337	The consequence of the Court of Appeal 's conclusion must now be considered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	338	It would have been within the power of the Court of Appeal to order a retrial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	339	It was , however , a result for which understandably neither side argued . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	340	The Court of Appeal rightly did not order a retrial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	341	In these circumstances , the duty devolved upon the Court of Appeal to substitute a fair and realistic verdict which was open to the jury on the evidence and on the judge 's directions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	342	Given that Mr Grobbelaar was shown to be a corrupt goalkeeper it was within the discretion of the Court of Appeal to adopt one of two courses , namely -LRB- a -RRB- to find in favour of the Sun on substantial justification or -LRB- b -RRB- to find on liability in favour of Mr Grobbelaar but award a nominal sum of # 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	343	Either decision was open to the jury and therefore open to the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	344	The decision of the Court to adopt course -LRB- a -RRB- was sound in law and just . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	345	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	346	It follows that the appeal of Mr Grobbelaar should be dismissed . 	lord steyn	self	outcome	0.4	NAN
225	347	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	348	If , contrary to my view , the correct disposal of this case is to allow the appeal , to restore the verdict in favour of Mr Grobbelaar and to reflect his systematic corrupt dealings with a reduced award of damages , he should in my view only be entitled to a derisory award of # 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	349	His reputation as a sportsman has been destroyed by his corrupt dealings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

225	351	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	352	In dealing with damages , I have not lost sight of an argument by counsel for the Sun that the House does not have the power to determine the award of damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	353	The argument was that section 8 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 entrust such a power only to the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	354	In my view the House of Lords as the highest court in the land has inherent jurisdiction to make any order which the Court of Appeal is by statute empowered to make : see Halsbury 's Laws , Vol 37 , para 12 ; I. H. Jacob , The Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court , -LRB- 1970 -RRB- 23 CLP 23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

225	356	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	357	Faced with Mr Grobbelaar 's participation in two criminal conspiracies counsel for Mr Grobbelaar tried to justify a significant award in favour of Mr Grobbelaar on the ground of excessive coverage of the story and the ridicule heaped on Mr Grobbelaar . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	358	I would reject this argument as contrary to freedom of expression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	359	The right of the Sun to decide on the extent of the coverage and the right of the Sun to employ wounding ridicule in respect of a corrupt goalkeeper is protected by a constitutional right of free speech under domestic law and under article 10.1 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	360	The right to freedom of expression under article 10.1 extends to information and ideas `` that offend , shock or disturb '' : Gatley on Libel and Slander , 1998 , 9th ed , para 23.19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	361	To curtail the right of a satirist to deploy ridicule to the extent and in the manner in which he chooses would be a far reaching incursion on freedom of speech . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	362	There is no warrant in our legal history , modern principles of public law , convention principles , or policy for such an approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

225	365	I would not accede to counsel 's request to grant to Mr Grobbelaar the discretionary remedy of an injunction restraining the Sun from repeating the allegation that he had actually fixed matches . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
225	366	Despite Mr Grobbelaar 's proved participation in two football related criminal conspiracies his counsel asked the House to grant to Mr Grobbelaar the discretionary remedy of an injunction restraining the Sun from repeating the allegation that he had actually fixed matches .

225	388	This libel action between a well known footballer and a wide circulation tabloid newspaper has given rise to starkly differing responses from the courts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	389	The trial before Gray J and a jury led to rulings that the newspaper was not entitled to rely upon qualified privilege and jury verdicts that there should be judgment for the plaintiff and that his damages should be # 85,000 but should not include any exemplary damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	390	The newspaper 's appeal against the judge 's ruling on privilege was dismissed by the Court of Appeal but its appeal against the jury verdict in favour of the plaintiff was successful on the ground that it was perverse . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	391	The Court of Appeal set aside the verdict for the plaintiff and entered judgment for the defendants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN

225	395	They confirm the need to keep a firm grasp of the principles of the law of defamation and guard against being swayed by , albeit understandable , indignation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	396	Also fundamental is the fact that there was more than one issue for the jury to determine . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	397	They were asked to answer three distinct questions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	398	The first concerned the issue of substantial justification which asked for a verdict for the plaintiff -LSB- claimant -RSB- or the defendants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	399	This was the issue of liability : as I have said , the verdict of the jury was for the plaintiff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	400	The second , which only arose if the first verdict was for the plaintiff , concerned the amount of the damages which should be awarded to him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN

225	403	I am grateful to my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham for his review of the facts which will release me from that task and permit me to proceed straight to the critical features of this case and the reasons which have led me to conclude that the appeal should be allowed . 	lord hobhouse	self	outcome	0.5	NAN
225	404	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	405	This is a case where there is an agreed natural and ordinary meaning of the libellous publications : `` The Plaintiff , -LRB- a -RRB- having dishonestly taken bribes , had fixed or attempted to fix the result of games of football in which he had played , and -LRB- b -RRB- had dishonestly taken bribes with a view to fixing the result of games in which he would be playing . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	406	This was the meaning which the plaintiff had pleaded and the defendants had admitted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	407	The first limb , -LRB- a -RRB- , related to what it was said had occurred with a man known as ` the short man ' -LRB- one Richard Lim -RRB- earlier than the time of the taped meetings with Vincent and the second limb , -LRB- b -RRB- , to what it was said the plaintiff agreed with Vincent to do for Vincent 's supposed principals in the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	408	Further , in each limb , the agreed meaning contained two aspects : one was fixing , or attempting to fix , or intending to fix , the result of football matches in which the plaintiff was playing and the other was the dishonest taking of bribes to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	409	The plaintiff had pleaded the whole of the published material and the defendants had abandoned any reliance upon s. 5 of the Defamation Act 1952 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	410	It was therefore for the jury to decide where the sting of the defamatory statements lay and to decide whether the defendants had proved that it was in substance true - ie substantially justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	411	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	412	But there was a complication : although the parties had agreed the meaning of the defamatory publications , they were not , anyway by the closing stages of the trial , agreeing about where the sting of the libel lay . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	413	The plaintiff had argued throughout that it lay in the allegation that he had deliberately fixed or ` thrown ' matches and was prepared to do so again . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	414	The defendants by the end of the trial were arguing that the sting lay simply in the statement that he had taken bribes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	415	The reason for this development was , so far as the defendants were concerned , not far to seek . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	416	In their pleading , they pleaded the defence of justification but they alleged that there was only one match where the plaintiff had deliberately let in a goal : Coventry City v Southampton , 24th September 1994 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	417	At the trial the plaintiff had made a positive case that he had never deliberately let in any goal , that he had never attempted to and that he never would . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	418	He not only gave evidence to that effect himself but relied upon film evidence of the games in which he had played and the unimpeached expert evidence already referred to by my noble and learned friend . 	lord hobhouse	lord bingham	partagr	0.5	NAN
225	419	The defendants called no evidence to contradict this part of the plaintiff 's case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	420	The defendants were therefore inevitably going to fail on the issue of justification unless they could persuade the jury that the sting lay in the taking of bribes rather than in the fixing of the result of matches and willingness to do so again . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	421	46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	422	The defendants failed in this endeavour and it is not difficult to see why . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	423	This was a trial by jury : the relevant issues were for the jury to decide . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	424	The assessment of the jurors would be closer to that of the football fans , who go to football matches and who would be outraged by the idea that one of their footballing heroes was only pretending to play and the match which they had paid to watch was only a charade , than it would be to that of others , like lawyers , who would be outraged by the taking of bribes whether or not accompanied by the deception of the would-be briber . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	425	The plaintiff 's view of the sting of the libel was amply supported by the way in which the newspaper had itself presented the story to its readers with references to - `` The # 40,000 was his reward for cheating fans and team mates by making sure Liverpool crashed 3-0 away to Newcastle last November '' - '' ... despite him giving away goals '' - '' ... for throwing a Premiership match '' - '' ... cheating Grobbelaar '' - '' ... unlike Grobbelaar , -LSB- M -RSB- was never accused of fixing games , just betting on results '' - `` Grobbelaar could be jailed for two years for match rigging '' - `` he has betrayed every soccer fan in the country by cynically reducing the game they love to a sham '' - `` the shame of his game-throwing will haunt him for the rest of his life '' - `` making a fan on the Kop a fool on the hill '' -LSB- Quotes taken from the 9th and 10th November . -RSB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	426	The newspaper and its editor clearly knew where the real impact of the story lay with the public . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	427	This impact was reflected in the agreed meaning of the words published . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	428	One of the first things which the plaintiff said to the second defendant on the telephone after the confrontation at the airport on 8th November was : `` I 've never attempted to throw a game in my life . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN

225	430	47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	431	Under these circumstances , the jury could not be criticised for taking the view that the sting was the accusation of match fixing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	432	Even standing alone , it was a very serious accusation to make against a professional footballer and , if true , completely destructive of his reputation as a professional footballer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	433	A goal keeper who deliberately lets in goals is betraying the fans and reducing the game to a sham . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	434	For myself , I would have been surprised if the jury had come to any other verdict on the justification issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	435	But , in any event , it was a matter for them and their conclusion was not unreasonable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	436	It was a conclusion which was open to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	437	The issue was properly left to them by the trial judge with proper directions and their first verdict was in no way perverse . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	438	48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	439	Two arguments have been advanced in response . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	440	The first is that advanced in argument by the newspaper . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	441	It can be expressed in words such as these : That a professional sportsman has deliberately underperformed in a match is bound to be very difficult to prove - all sportsmen make mistakes in the course of play - an international class striker may miss the goal from point blank range - deliberate errors are virtually impossible to prove . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	442	If this argument is meant to suggest that when the truth of a defamatory statement is difficult to prove , and has not been proved , then the truth of the statement may be treated as proved nevertheless , it is not the law , nor should it be . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	443	The law is that so far as the issue of justification is concerned , the publisher of the defamatory statement must allege and prove that the statements of fact were substantially true , no more , no less . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	444	In the present case , the defendants did not at the trial attempt to rebut the plaintiff 's evidence that he had never attempted to throw a game . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	445	The legitimate relevance of the argument is to the defence of qualified privilege : Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 2 AC 127 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	446	The defendants attempted to set up the defence of qualified privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	447	If they had succeeded , the defendants would then not have had to prove truth and the plaintiff would have had to prove malice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	448	But they failed both before the judge and the Court of Appeal in their claim to qualified privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	449	If the publication is not privileged , the publisher must prove that the relevant statement was substantially true . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	450	If he thinks that he may be unable to prove its truth , he must make sure that he conducts himself responsibly so as to be able to rely upon qualified privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	451	Few would quarrel with the proposition that newspapers which are publishing defamatory statements of fact which they may not be able to prove are true must behave responsibly if they wish to take advantage of the protection of the law of qualified privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	452	49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	453	The other argument is in essence that which succeeded before the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	454	It is said that the jury misunderstood the gravamen of the accusation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	455	Corruption is much more serious than letting in goals deliberately . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	456	The one is a criminal offence and the other , as such , is not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	457	Thus , Thorpe LJ , having -LRB- at p. 464 -RRB- stressed the criminality of even accepting a bribe , identified what he described as `` the relevant realities '' and distinguishing between the corrupt agreement `` capable of clear proof '' and -LRB- overlooking the fact that this was a case where the evidence had actually disproved any `` betrayal on the pitch '' -RRB- the `` betrayal on the pitch '' which was not , said -LRB- at p. 467 -RRB- : `` The proper recognition of corruption rather than fixing as the primary issue renders Mr Hartley 's submission -LSB- for the plaintiff -RSB- almost repugnant . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
225	458	At p. 461 Simon Brown summed up his own view of the case : `` All that had to be decided was whether Mr Grobbelaar took corrupt payments . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	459	50 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	460	There are two straight forward and obvious answers to this line of argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	461	The first is that it was a matter for the jury and the Court of Appeal should have accepted the jury 's verdict on this point unless they were prepared to decide that there was no issue to go to the jury on this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	462	It was correctly accepted that there was an issue to go to the jury and that the agreed meaning and the publication were capable of having the significance contended for by the plaintiff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	463	The second is that , for the purposes of the law of defamation , what is relevant is the effect of the publication upon the perceptions of the ordinary reader of the Sun newspaper , not upon those of a judge of the Court of Appeal , and how it would alter such a reader 's view of the plaintiff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	464	Thus , the Court of Appeal not only confused the respective roles of judge and jury but also confused what might be relevant in other legal contexts with what is relevant in relation to defamatory publications . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	465	As counsel succinctly put it , citations from Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency , A-G v Blake , and judgments in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division -LRB- R v Carr and R v Mills -RRB- , see per Simon Brown LJ at p. 458 , do not have much of a place in the consciousness of the ordinary reader of a tabloid newspaper . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	466	The Lord Justice was seriously in error when he summed up his own view of the case , supplanting the principled approach to the issues and usurping the function of the jury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	467	51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	468	The judgment of the Court of Appeal set aside the first verdict of the jury as perverse . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	469	It followed from this that judgment was to be entered for the defendants , not the plaintiff , and the question of the perversity or otherwise of the other two verdicts did not formally arise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	470	Thus , they decided that it was perverse of the jury to remain unpersuaded that the agreed meaning of the defamatory material had been proved to have been substantially true . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	471	This was a remarkable decision since it was always open to the jury to remain unpersuaded upon an issue which has been properly left to them by the trial judge and of which the burden of proof rested upon the party against whom they are finding , as was the case here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	472	52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	473	Leaving on one side the fact that there was ample justification for the jury 's first verdict , it is instructive to identify the route by which the Court of Appeal arrived at their conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	474	The defendants had by their notice of appeal included the ground of appeal : `` and/or the damages -LSB- the jury -RSB- awarded were excessive and were such that no reasonable jury could have thought that such an award was necessary to compensate the Claimant and to re-establish his reputation . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	475	By their second verdict , the jury had awarded the plaintiff damages in the sum of # 85,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	476	53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	477	In argument before the Court of Appeal , counsel for the plaintiff inevitably had to accept that he could not contend that # 85,000 was not excessive unless he could persuade the Court of Appeal that -LRB- as was his client 's case -RRB- the bribery allegations were also unjustified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	478	This led the Court of Appeal to reason that the award of excessive damages by the jury 's second verdict led to the conclusion not that , like many juries , they had gone over the top in their award of damages -LRB- about which I will have something to say later -RRB- but that their first verdict must have been perverse . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	479	This reasoning is remarkable : it reasons that because the jury has gone wrong on verdict No. 2 , it has gone wrong on verdict No. 1 - perversely wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	480	This is simply a non sequitur . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	481	Verdict No. 1 is not dependent upon the correctness of verdict No. 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	482	54 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	483	This was a case in which the quantum of damages was a real issue and , at the request of the defendants , a Pamplin direction was given : see Pamplin v Express Newspapers Ltd -LSB- 1988 -RSB- 1 WLR 116 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	484	A Pamplin direction addresses the situation where a plaintiff is entitled to a verdict in his favour on the justification issue but the evidence properly before the jury on the issue of justification has disclosed that the reputation to which he is entitled is so depreciated that the damages which he should be awarded for the damage to his reputation by the -LRB- ex hypothesi -RRB- defamatory publication should be reduced below the level that would be appropriate for a plaintiff with an impeccable reputation , maybe even to a nominal figure : as Neill LJ said in Pamplin at -LSB- 1988 -RSB- 1 WLR p. 120 , `` There may be many cases , however , where a defendant who puts forward a defence of justification will be unable to prove sufficient facts to establish the defence at common law and will also be unable to bring himself within the statutory extension of the defence contained in s. 5 of the Defamation Act 1952 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	485	Nevertheless the defendant may be able to rely upon such facts as he has proved to reduce the damages , perhaps almost to vanishing point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	486	Thus a defence of partial justification , though it may not prevent the plaintiff from succeeding on the issue of liability , may be of great importance on the issue of damages . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	487	55 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	488	The problem of the defamation of persons of bad character is not new . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	489	The law has , with the assistance of the legislature , worked out a principled approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	490	What Neill LJ has said and the summing-up in the present case of Gray J reflects that principled approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	491	Before the publications in question , the plaintiff had a very high reputation in the world of football as an outstanding goalkeeper . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	492	The publications were designed to destroy that reputation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	493	The defendants were unable fully to justify the libel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	494	It was , as the Court of Appeal would have been entitled to conclude , a case of partial justification . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	495	On this basis the award of damages was excessive and liable to be set aside . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	496	But it is not principled to say that , because the damages should be reduced on grounds of partial justification , maybe even to a nominal sum , the defendants were entitled to a verdict and judgment on liability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	497	It is to be noted that the only reference to the Pamplin case in the Court of Appeal judgments is at p. 459 in the judgment of Simon Brown LJ where he dismisses it as irrelevant and the Pamplin direction as `` most unhelpful '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	498	With respect to the learned Lord Justice , this shows a serious error on his part in the understanding of the issues in a defamation action and the correct treatment of the question of a plaintiff who has been defamed but shown by admissible evidence to have a defective character . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	499	In so far as the learned Lord Justice in the same passage comments upon the facts of the case and expresses his own view about them , he is improperly trespassing upon the function of the jury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	500	56 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	501	But the unsatisfactory consequences of the Court of Appeal 's treatment of the damages issue do not stop there . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	502	The forensic position in which counsel for the plaintiff found himself led to his making only a restricted response to the appeal on the amount of the damages award -LRB- the jury 's second verdict -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	503	The way Jonathan Parker LJ described it -LRB- at paragraph 219 -RRB- was - `` Mr Hartley concedes that in awarding damages of # 85,000 the jury must have been satisfied not only that no actual match-fixing had taken place ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	504	but also that he had not been party to any corrupt arrangement , either with Mr Lim or with Mr Vincent : ... '' This restricted response was then treated as a concession and used as a basis for discrediting the jury 's first verdict as well . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	505	The so-called ` concession ' has now been advanced as a reason for dismissing the plaintiff 's appeal to your Lordship 's House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	506	It is said that the ` concession ' having been made , the plaintiff should be held to it -LRB- although no prejudice to the defendants is suggested -RRB- and the decision of the Court of Appeal upheld without further examination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	507	To accede to this submission would serve no greater purpose than to compound the Court of Appeal 's error . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	508	Your Lordships have been shown the passages in the transcript of the Court of Appeal upon which the argument is based . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	509	To my reading they are of very limited significance and do not extend beyond what would be expected in exchanges which take place when an advocate is being subjected to close questioning by an unsympathetic court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	510	It is a misuse of the privilege of having an oral hearing with oral arguments for a court to try to decide the case by obtaining ` concessions ' from counsel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	511	The purpose of oral argument is to inform , clarify and enlighten the minds of the court -LRB- hopefully in favour of the advocate 's client -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	512	It is not right to seek to decide cases upon the tenacity of the advocate or ` concessions ' forced out of the advocate in the course of oral argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	513	-LRB- This is not a case where a point has been conceded , in the proper sense of that word , either by a pleading or a statement in court and has thereafter governed what issues do and do not arise . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	514	Still less is it right to decide appeals upon the basis of upholding wrong decisions arrived at using legally mistaken ` concessions ' by counsel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	515	To have conceded that the excessive amount of the jury 's second verdict invalidated , or demonstrated perversity in , their first verdict would have been both legally and logically wrong -LRB- as well as being based upon wrong factual assumptions -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	516	57 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	517	A further criticism to be made of the Court of Appeal 's decision in the present case is that they chose to make a questionable inference in preference to adopting the ordinary and obvious explanation of the jury 's second verdict . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	518	The ordinary explanation is that the jury went wrong in some way in deciding upon the amount of their award . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	519	It is a commonplace that juries , even after an impeccable direction from the judge , may make such a mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	520	Why should one not infer that that is what occurred in the present case ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	521	I will come to the factors which may have led the jury to over-assess the damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	522	But , first , there are factors which militate against their having delivered a perverse verdict on liability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	523	The jury were properly directed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	524	It should not lightly be assumed that , in failing to be satisfied that a burden of proof had been discharged , a jury had acted perversely . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	525	There is no evidence that the jury were behaving irrationally during the trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	526	The verdicts were unanimous . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	527	Their third verdict was that the plaintiff should not recover exemplary -LRB- penal -RRB- damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	528	At criminal trials in 1997 , the plaintiff was tried on two counts , the first of conspiring corruptly with Lim and others and accepting money to fix or for having fixed matches , the second for corruptly accepting a bribe of # 2,000 from Vincent to fix or for having fixed matches . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	529	At the first criminal trial , the jury was unable to agree on either count . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	530	The jury was discharged and a re-trial was ordered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	531	At the re-trial , the plaintiff was unanimously acquitted on the first count and the jury was again unable to agree on the second count . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	532	It has not been suggested on this appeal that the criminal juries were acting perversely . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	533	At the civil trial , the defendants did not call Mr Vincent even though some of what they had published had only come from him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	534	Mr Carman told the jury : `` We would regard him as a wholly unreliable witness , therefore we do not propose to call him to give evidence because I do not want to present to you on behalf of the Sun newspaper someone whose evidence we believe may be highly suspect and whose whole character may be deeply flawed . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	535	Nor was Mr Lim called . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	536	It may be that the correct evaluation of what they had seen and heard on the tapes did not seem to the civil jury -LRB- nor to the criminal juries -RRB- to be as clear cut as it did to the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	537	The question why should one infer that the civil jury was perverse remains unanswered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	538	58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	539	But the other aspect affecting the inference is the probable explanation for an inflated award of damages against the defendants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	540	The primary focus of the present appeal has been the conduct of the plaintiff and what he is recorded as having said on the tapes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
225	541	This is quite right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	542	What he had said , if true , was gravely incriminating . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	543	His only answer was that what he had said was not true . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	544	Some of what he had said was proved to be untrue : where did that leave the remainder ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	545	As juries are reminded every day of the week in relation to confessions , the fact that a person has admitted something means that what he has said may be used against him as powerful evidence of the truth of what he has said ; but the jury must still consider whether , in the circumstances , the admission is reliable and does in fact represent the truth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	546	To prove that the plaintiff was a liar does not of itself prove the truth of anything that he said . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	547	What occurred in the present case involved sordid and wholly despicable conversations , apparently incriminating of both the plaintiff and Vincent , which took place in a bugged hotel bedroom and a bugged flat , secretly taped , between the plaintiff and a person who may have cheated the plaintiff in the past and whom the defendants did not call for the reasons -LRB- quoted above -RRB- which Mr Carman explained to the jury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	548	How much credence to give to what the plaintiff had said , first , in the hotel bedroom and the flat and , then , on oath in the witness box at the trial was a matter for the jury and was relevant , under the Pamplin principle , to the assessment of damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	549	The Court of Appeal considered that the jury must have given more credit to what the plaintiff had said in the witness box and less to what he had said on tape than they , the Court of Appeal , considered appropriate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	550	On this view , the damages awarded were excessive -LRB- as counsel accepted -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	551	As the Court of Appeal held , there was an ample basis for the view that the jury had over-estimated the damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	552	59 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	553	But the jury were also entitled to , and no doubt did , take into account the conduct of the defendants in connection with the publication , the character of the publication and the effect of their conduct in aggravating the injury to the plaintiff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	554	These aspects of the case were discussed by the Court of Appeal in the context of qualified privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	555	They were remarkable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	556	The publication was not a single publication but was a sustained campaign extending over eight issues of the newspaper with no less than six pages devoted to the story in the first of these issues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	557	The publications included , at the least , a mixture of allegations which the newspaper could and could not substantiate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	558	They depended in part upon a disreputable witness , Vincent , whom their counsel was later to describe as `` wholly unreliable '' and as having , in their belief , a maybe `` deeply flawed '' character . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	559	The entrapment which they had engineered had had a number of very questionable features . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	560	They gratuitously involved in the publications the plaintiff 's wife and children with successive series of pictures of them and statements such as - `` Shameful secret has Deb close to tears . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	561	Grobbelaar 's wife Debbie was close to tears yesterday when we broke news of how her husband fixed matches for money . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN

225	565	... '' They staged a deliberately intimidating ambush of the plaintiff at Gatwick by a team of six photographers and reporters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	566	When the plaintiff had issued a writ against them , they informed their readers that they had retained Mr Carman and , referring to the plaintiff , said : `` What will happen to the case ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	567	We 're confident he will drop it like he drops everything else . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN

225	569	60 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	570	Many juries would in these circumstances make a substantial award of damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	571	An award of # 85,000 is within the range of awards which a jury might erroneously think appropriate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	572	It is wrong to treat it as evidence of perversity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	573	The conclusion that a jury has acted perversely , that is to say in breach of their oath , is a serious matter and not lightly to be inferred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	574	If there is another more plausible explanation of their verdict , it should certainly be preferred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	575	To assume perversity unworthily discredits an integral and honourable part of the justice system . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN

225	577	I therefore consider that the appeal should be allowed and the first verdict of the jury upheld . 	lord hobhouse	self	outcome	0.7	NAN
225	578	I agree that the award of damages in the sum of # 85,000 was excessive and must be reduced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	579	If it had been much more modest , say a four figure sum , it would in my judgment have been unappealable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	580	But it was not and , in respect for the opinion of my noble and learned friend , Lord Bingham , that the award should be reduced to a nominal sum , I will , applying Pamplin , concur in a reduction of the award to # 1 . 	lord hobhouse	lord bingham	partagr	0.7	NAN
225	581	The plaintiff has been shown by the first verdict to be entitled to a verdict and judgment in his favour and to some award of damages to demonstrate that he has been tortiously defamed by the defendants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	582	There remains the formulation of a limited injunction or undertaking to restrain any repetition of the tortious statements as is the normal practice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	583	Indeed , counsel suggested that they should agree a suitable wording should the appeal be allowed , as it has been . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	584	However , in deference again to the view of my noble and learned friend and notwithstanding that it may merely serve to increase the costs , I am prepared to accept his proposal that , in the absence of an agreed undertaking , the question of the grant of an injunction should be left to be dealt with on an application to a judge of the High Court , Queen 's Bench Division , if the plaintiff chooses to make one , and I am accordingly content that the plaintiff should be given the proposed liberty to apply . 	lord hobhouse	lord bingham	partagr	0.7	NAN

225	586	Two points remain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	587	Both sides ' counsel suggested to your Lordships that this House had no power to set aside an excessive award and substitute a lesser award of damages in a defamation case tried with a jury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	588	They said that that power was confined to the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN

225	590	Secondly , the defendants were given leave to cross-appeal on the ground that the trial judge had misdirected the jury on the justification issues relevant to their first verdict . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN

225	605	At the conclusion of the trial the jury were asked three questions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	606	They answered them as follows : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Do you find for the Claimant -LRB- Mr. Grobbelaar -RRB- or the Defendants ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	607	For the Claimant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	608	-LRB- 2 -RRB- What amount of damages do you award him ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	609	# 85,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	610	-LRB- 3 -RRB- Does your award contain any sum by way of exemplary damages ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	611	No. 66 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	612	It was common ground in the Court of Appeal that the award of # 85,000 was consistent only with a finding that neither of the alleged conspiracies was established . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	613	It would not be wholly accurate to say that this was agreed between the parties or that it was a concession made by either of them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	614	Rather each party argued from the same premise because it suited its case to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	615	Once the premise was accepted the Court of Appeal was fully justified in holding that the jury 's finding was perverse . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	616	On the evidence before them no reasonable jury properly directed could make such a finding . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	617	But the premise was false . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	618	The only inference which could properly be drawn from the jury 's answer to Question 1 was that the Defendants had failed to establish what they found to be the gist of the publication of which complaint was made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	619	67 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	620	In my view an appellate Court ought not to find the verdict of a jury on liability to be perverse unless there is no rational explanation for it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	621	There is not the same constraint against finding an award of damages to be excessive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	622	In the light of the evidence which was before the jury , a much more plausible explanation of the jury 's verdict is that it found that the sting of the libel lay in the allegation that Mr. Grobbelaar had thrown matches in which he was playing by deliberately letting in goals , and that it was only this allegation which the Defendants had failed to establish . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	623	On the evidence such a finding was clearly open to the jury and would not have been perverse . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
225	624	It would not have justified an award of # 85,000 , or indeed any substantial award , but that is another matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	625	68 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	626	The Court of Appeal were not bound by the premise on which the case was argued before them merely because it suited both parties to adopt it , and your Lordships are certainly not bound to accept it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	627	If the jury found that the sting of the libel lay in the allegations of match-fixing rather than the allegations of the corrupt agreements , they were entitled to find that this had not been established . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	628	This is sufficient to uphold their verdict for Mr. Grobbelaar on liability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	629	They should not be taken to have reached a perverse finding , in the teeth of overwhelming evidence to the contrary , that the Defendants had also failed to establish the existence of the corrupt agreements . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	630	But a finding that Mr Grobbelaar had been a party to either or both corrupt agreements would be enough to deprive him of any right to substantial damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	631	It would be an affront to justice if a man who accepts bribes to throw matches should obtain damages for the loss of his reputation as a professional sportsman merely because he can not be shown to have carried out his part of the bargain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	632	69 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	633	Accordingly , I would allow the appeal , enter judgment for the plaintiff , and substitute an award of # 1 by way of derisory damages . 	lord millett	self	outcome	0.8	NAN
225	634	I would also give Mr Grobbelaar liberty to apply to the High Court for a suitably worded injunction to restrain any repetition of the allegation that he actually fixed matches . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	635	By his own conduct Mr. Grobbelaar has destroyed the value of his own reputation , and this is sufficient to disentitle him to any but nominal damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	636	But it would not justify the Defendants in republishing an allegation the truth of which a jury have found that they have been unable to substantiate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	637	Such conduct would still constitute an actionable wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	638	Mr Grobbelaar may have no reputation to lose ; but that does not make him an object of ridicule , fair game for every slander that an imaginative journalist can concoct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	639	It is precisely because his reputation is worthless that damages would be an inadequate remedy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

225	641	The maxim that `` he who comes into equity must come with clean hands '' must not be taken too far . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	642	It has no application in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	643	As Brandeis J explained in Loughran v Loughran 292 US 216 at p 229 -LRB- 1934 -RRB- `` Equity does not demand that its suitors shall have led blameless lives . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	644	There must be `` an immediate and necessary relation to the equity sued for '' : see Dering v Earl of Winchelsea -LRB- 1787 -RRB- 1 Cox Eq 318 , 319 per Eyre CB . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	645	Any such relation between Mr Grobbelaar 's wrongdoing -LRB- which must be taken to have lain in taking bribes , not in throwing football matches -RRB- and the way in which the Defendants reported it came to an end when the jury returned their verdict and exonerated him of the charge which is the subject of the proposed injunction .

225	647	LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	648	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	649	71 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	650	In what circumstances is it permissible for an appellate court to reverse on an issue of fact a verdict given by a jury in a civil case ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	651	That is the central question in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	652	In our system of justice juries occupy a position of near veneration , at least as far as many lawyers and most of the media are concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	653	The veneration is mainly attributable , I think , to the historic role of juries in criminal cases in standing between the accused citizen and the power and authority of the executive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	654	Judges have not always in the history of our justice system been seen to be independent of the executive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	655	The independence from the executive of prosecuting authorities has not always been apparent and still today is regarded with some cynicism by some people . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	656	So it is not surprising that the role of juries in the criminal justice system is widely regarded as constituting a key and necessary protection for the citizens of this country from unfair and oppressive prosecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	657	72 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	658	Juries , like judges , do not always come to the correct conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	659	The question as to what can be done by an appellate court if the verdict of a jury in a criminal case appears in the light of the evidence to be plainly wrong must receive a variable answer depending on whether the verdict is to acquit or to convict . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	660	If the verdict is to acquit , it can not be reversed on appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	661	The accused walks free no matter how plainly wrong the verdict may appear to be . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	662	The jury 's verdict is sacrosanct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	663	But that is so only if the verdict is in favour of the accused . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	664	If the jury should convict the accused their verdict is by no means sacrosanct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	665	An appellate court can be invited to examine the evidence , review the trial judge 's summing-up and either substitute an acquittal for the conviction or direct a re-trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	666	The criteria for taking these steps is a good deal less stringent than that the jury 's verdict was plainly wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	667	It will suffice if the court thinks that the jury 's verdict simply was not safe . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	668	The imbalance between the sacrosanct character of a jury verdict of acquittal and the relatively less than conclusive character of a jury verdict to convict is a consequence of the nature of criminal proceedings and the revulsion about convicting a person who is possibly innocent that rightly permeates the criminal justice system . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	669	There is no comparable revulsion about acquitting a person who is possibly guilty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	670	73 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	671	I have made these rather trite remarks about the status of a jury verdict in the criminal justice system not because they have any direct relevance to the present case but in order to emphasise the inappropriateness of treating a jury verdict in favour of a defendant in a defamation case as though it deserved a status comparable to that of a verdict of acquittal in a criminal case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	672	If a person , believing himself to have been defamed , brings a defamation action and there is no dispute but that the defendant was responsible for uttering the words complained of and no dispute but that the words were defamatory of the claimant , the defendant , in order to rely on the defence of justification , must prove that the words were true . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	673	If the allegation was of criminal conduct on the part of the claimant , that he was a thief , or a fraudster , or a child molester , or whatever , the defendant must satisfy the jury that that was so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	674	In effect , the defendant must satisfy the jury that the claimant had indeed committed the crime that the defamatory words had alleged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	675	There is , therefore , a clear analogy between the role of the prosecutor in a criminal case , endeavouring to satisfy the jury that the accused committed the crime with which he is charged , and the role of a defendant who has pleaded justification in a defamation case , endeavouring to satisfy the jury that the claimant had committed the crime alleged against him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	676	But the analogy becomes a misleading one if carried too far . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	677	Although in the defamation case , the jury 's verdict in favour of the claimant must necessarily have rejected the justification defence and indicated that the jury had not been satisfied that the claimant had committed the crime alleged , the verdict does not have the sacrosanct character of a verdict of `` not guilty '' in a criminal case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	678	In a civil case , the parties litigate on an even playing field . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	679	It is as much of an affront to justice if a `` guilty '' claimant succeeds in obtaining damages as it is if an `` innocent '' claimant fails in his claim for damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	680	A verdict in favour of the defendant , the jury apparently being satisfied that the claimant had committed the crime alleged , can not be set aside simply because the court thinks that the verdict was not `` safe '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	681	Something more would be required . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	682	The appellate court would need to be satisfied that , in the light of the evidence , a jury could not reasonably have concluded that the claimant had committed the crime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	683	The verdict would have to be shown to be plainly wrong and one that no reasonable jury could have reached . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	684	A lower threshold would not suffice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	685	74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	686	The case is no different where a jury , apparently not satisfied that a justification defence has been made out , finds in favour of the claimant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	687	If an appellate court can be satisfied that no reasonable jury could , on the evidence in the case , have reached that decision , ie that the rejection of the justification defence was plainly wrong , then the appellate court must set aside the jury 's verdict . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	688	Justice to the defendant , no more and no less important in a civil case than justice to the claimant , so demands . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	689	75 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	690	In reviewing a jury 's verdict against the background of the evidence given in the case in question , an appellate court is always faced with the difficulty that the jury will have given no reasons for their decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	691	Underlying the verdict there is often likely to have been a series of decisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	692	There may have been alternative possible routes leading to the verdict , some of questionable legitimacy , others less susceptible to impeachment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	693	The appellate court will not know which route the jury has taken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	694	In criminal cases the difficulty is surmounted by treating the verdict of acquittal as sacrosanct and the verdict of conviction as amenable to being set aside by anything rendering it not `` safe '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	695	The certainty of the former and the comfort of the latter are not available on appeals from jury verdicts in civil cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	696	Each side is equally entitled to justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	697	The appellate court must , of course , pay proper respect to the jury verdict . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	698	The jury are the fact finders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	699	In a civil case , the jury , as fact finders , are entitled to the same respect , no more and no less , than that which is due to a trial judge sitting without a jury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	700	The difference is that the trial judge 's reasoning will be , or should be , on the face of the judgment whereas the jury 's reasons , being undisclosed , will need to be re-constructed by the appellate court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	701	Subject to that important difference , however , the factual conclusions of juries in civil cases should , in my opinion , be treated by an appellate court no differently , with no greater and no less respect , than the factual conclusions of judges . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	702	76 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	703	In the present case there were four critical issues which had to be resolved before a verdict could be reached . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	704	They were the following : -LRB- 1 -RRB- What was the `` sting '' of the defamatory articles that the Sun had to justify in order to succeed in its justification defence ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	705	The parties were in agreement about the defamatory meaning of the articles , namely , that Mr Grobbelaar '' -LRB- a -RRB- having dishonestly taken bribes had fixed or attempted to fix the results of games of football in which he had played , and -LRB- b -RRB- had dishonestly taken bribes with a view to fixing the result of games in which he would be playing . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	706	It is well established law that in order to make good a defence plea of justification , the defendant does not have to prove the truth of every injurious allegation that he has made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	707	It suffices if the defendant makes good the `` sting '' of the allegations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
225	708	And it is for the jury , as part of the process of deciding whether a justification defence plea has been made good , to decide what is the `` sting '' of the defamatory remarks in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	709	So it was for the Grobbelaar jury to decide what was the `` sting '' of the Sun articles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	710	Was it the allegation that Mr Grobbelaar had taken bribes with a view to fixing or attempting to fix football matches ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	711	Or was it that he had taken bribes and had fixed , or attempted to fix , football matches ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	712	Or was it both ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	713	-LRB- 2 -RRB- The jury had to decide whether Mr Grobbelaar had taken bribes from Mr Lim with a view to fixing football matches . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	714	The Sun alleged that he had . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	715	-LRB- 3 -RRB- The jury had to decide whether , pursuant to his corrupt agreement with Mr Lim , Mr Grobbelaar had deliberately let in , or attempted to let in , goals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	716	The Sun alleged that he had done so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	717	-LRB- 4 -RRB- The jury had to decide whether Mr Grobbelaar had taken bribes from Mr Vincent with a view to fixing football matches . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

225	719	77 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	720	The jury returned a verdict in favour of Mr Grobbelaar and awarded him damages of # 85,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	721	On appeal to the Court of Appeal the Sun contended that the verdict was plainly wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	722	It contended that the jury could not reasonably have rejected its justification defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	723	Mr Hartley QC , counsel for Mr Grobbelaar , submitted that the Sun was contending , in effect , that the trial judge , Mr Justice Gray , should have directed the jury that it was not open to them to find in favour of Mr Grobbelaar that the justification defence was not made out and should have withdrawn that issue from them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	724	In my opinion , this submission can not be accepted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	725	Before the fate of the justification defence could be settled the `` sting '' of the articles had to be identified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	726	This was a matter for the jury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	727	The defence could not , therefore , have been withdrawn from them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	728	The judge had no alternative but to sum-up to the jury and leave the issue to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	729	There has been no significant criticism of his summing-up . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	730	78 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	731	The Court of Appeal , for their part , had no alternative but to examine the evidence relevant to the justification issue and ask themselves whether the jury 's verdict rejecting the justification defence could be sustained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	732	As my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn has said -LRB- para 32 -RRB- it was common ground in the Court of Appeal that the jury 's award of # 85,000 was consistent only with the jury having rejected the allegations that Mr Grobbelaar had entered into corrupt agreements with Mr Lim and Mr Vincent . 	lord scott	lord steyn	partagr	0.9	NAN
225	733	A goalkeeper who is exposed as someone who has agreed to take money to let in goals , but , in a double-cross of his co-conspirators does not in fact let in goals , is not , if accused of deliberately letting in goals , deprived of a reputation worth # 85,000 , if anything at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	734	I , therefore , respectfully agree with the Court of Appeal that the jury must have rejected the charge in the Sun 's articles that Mr Grobbelaar had agreed to take bribes for throwing matches . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	735	The jury must also have rejected the charge that Mr Grobbelaar had deliberately let in goals or attempted to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	736	As to this , the jury 's rejection of the charge could not possibly be described as plainly wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	737	The Sun 's case was wholly based on the admissions that Mr Grobbelaar himself had made in the video-taped conversations that he had had with Mr Vincent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	738	But the evidence of Mr Bob Wilson and Mr Alan Ball that none of the relevant goals that had been scored against Mr Grobbelaar were associated with any sign of bad goalkeeping and , indeed , that on occasions in the matches in question Mr Grobbelaar had achieved saves that no ordinary goalkeeper would have managed , was very strong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	739	The jury was entitled , on this evidence , to conclude that Mr Grobbelaar had not in fact deliberately let in any of the goals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	740	79 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	741	But what about the corrupt agreements ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	742	As to the agreement with Mr Lim , the Sun 's case was based on Mr Grobbelaar 's admissions made in the course of the video-taped conversations he had had with Mr Vincent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	743	As to the agreement with Mr Vincent , too , the Sun 's case was based on the evidence of the video-tapes but here the visual and aural evidence was incontrovertible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	744	The tapes showed the two men entering into the corrupt agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	745	Mr Grobbelaar 's admissions about his previous corrupt agreement with Mr Lim and about the goals pursuant to the agreement that he had deliberately let in or attempted to let in were the background to the agreement being negotiated between Mr Grobbelaar and Mr Vincent and recorded on the video tapes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	746	80 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	747	Mr Grobbelaar endeavoured to explain away what the video tapes revealed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	748	His explanation was not credible for the reasons very fully set out in the Court of Appeal judgments and that I need not repeat . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	749	I concur with my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill in concluding that no reasonable juror could have concluded that Mr Grobbelaar 's apparent making of a corrupt bargain with Mr Vincent and his acceptance of money from him were merely a pretence on his part -LRB- paras 17 and 20 of Lord Bingham 's opinion -RRB- . 	lord scott	lord bingham	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	750	In my opinion , the same conclusion is justified so far as Mr Grobbelaar 's admissions about his dealings with Mr Lim are concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	751	Here , of course , there is no comparable visual and aural evidence of the making of the corrupt bargain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	752	But there is a wealth of material corroborating the admissions about his dealings with Mr Lim made by Mr Grobbelaar in the course of the video-taped conversations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	753	The material was conveniently brought together for your Lordships in a note handed up by Mr Spearman QC , counsel for the Sun , but all the details are to be found in the Court of Appeal judgments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	754	81 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	755	Mr Hartley put at the forefront of his submissions to your Lordships that the Court of Appeal had erred in putting themselves in the position of fact finders and substituting their opinion about the credibility of Mr Grobbelaar 's explanations for that of the jury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	756	This criticism was , in my opinion , misplaced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	757	The Sun 's appeal against the jury 's verdict was that , on all the evidence , the verdict was perverse , plainly wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	758	This is a ground of appeal that is open to a disappointed litigant whether the fact finder be a judge or a jury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	759	In dealing with the Sun 's appeal the Court of Appeal was bound to review all the relevant evidence and ask itself whether the assumed findings of the jury , necessary to sustain the verdict , were findings to which a reasonable jury could come . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	760	If they were not , the Court of Appeal had no option but to overturn the verdict . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	761	The approach would have been no different if the fact finder had been a judge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	762	But in that case the critical findings would , or should , have been expressed and would not have had to be assumed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	763	82 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	764	In my opinion the Court of Appeal was well-entitled , having reviewed all the evidence , to overturn the rejection by the jury of the Sun 's case that Mr Grobbelaar had entered into a corrupt agreement with Mr Lim and had received bribes from him pursuant to that agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	765	The jury 's assumed finding to the contrary was , in the face of this material , plainly wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	766	83 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	767	The position , therefore , is that the jury 's assumed finding that Mr Grobbelaar did not actually fix or attempt to fix matches must stand , but the assumed finding that he did not enter into a corrupt agreement to do so can not stand . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	768	In these circumstances , can the jury 's rejection of the Sun 's justification defence be sustained ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	769	The answer depends on identifying what was the `` sting '' of the Sun 's articles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	770	If the `` sting '' was , or included , that he had thrown matches , the justification defence was not made out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	771	84 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	772	Identification of the `` sting '' is for the jury , and it would have been open to the jury , in my opinion , to have concluded that the `` sting '' , or at least an important part of the `` sting '' , lay in the allegation that Mr Grobbelaar had deliberately let in or attempted to let in goals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	773	The verdict in favour of Mr Grobbelaar is consistent with the jury having come to that conclusion and , in my opinion , the Court of Appeal ought not to have disturbed that verdict . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	774	The Sun 's articles had charged Mr Grobbelaar not only with entering into corrupt agreements to throw matches for money but also with having actually done so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	775	On the footing that they had failed to prove that he had actually done so , although they had proved everything else , Mr Grobbelaar was , in my opinion , entitled to uphold the jury verdict in his favour . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	776	85 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	777	In these circumstances Mr Grobbelaar is no doubt entitled at least to nominal damage to mark the success , but is he entitled to any greater sum ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	778	In my opinion , he is not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	779	There are two considerations which , to my mind , overwhelm all others . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	780	86 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	781	First , the Sun based its articles on what Mr Grobbelaar had himself said . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	782	He was seen on the video tapes entering into the corrupt agreement with Mr Vincent ; he was heard on the tapes admitting that he had entered into a corrupt agreement with Mr Lim ; and he was heard admitting that he had , pursuant to his arrangements with Mr Lim , either thrown or attempted to throw matches . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	783	His explanations for these things were not credible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	784	A reasonable jury would have had no alternative but to reject them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	785	In the context in which Mr Grobbelaar 's admissions were made the admissions lacked nothing in credibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	786	The Sun believed them and based the articles upon them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	787	Why should it not have done so ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	788	In my opinion , Mr Grobbelaar brought on his own head the publication of that which he had admitted to doing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	789	If an individual makes damaging admissions about himself which come to the attention of a third party who has no reason to doubt their credibility and who repeats them in public , the notion that the individual can then , by successfully denying the truth of his admissions , succeed in extracting defamation damages from the third party seems to me inconsistent with justice as well as with common sense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	790	It has not been suggested to your Lordships that the Law Reform -LRB- Contributory Negligence -RRB- Act 1945 might have a part to play in such a scenario but it seems to me that it might , and , in any event , that , quantum of damages being at large , justice would be done by confining the individual to whatever satisfaction a jury 's , or a judge 's , public recognition of the falsity of his admissions might bring . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
225	791	In the present case , I would adopt that approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	792	The admissions by Mr Grobbelaar having become known to the Sun and Mr Grobbelaar having failed to provide any credible explanation for them , the Sun was bound , in my opinion , to make them public . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	793	The admissions were matters of legitimate public interest and concern and that is what newspapers are for . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	794	To hold the Sun liable to pay substantial , as opposed to nominal , damages for publishing articles based on Mr Grobbelaar 's own admissions and for their failure to prove that these admissions were true , would , in my view , be quite wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	795	87 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	796	Second , a professional footballer who has agreed to accept , and has accepted , bribes with a view to throwing matches has so diminished his reputation in the eyes of right thinking people that his success in establishing that , in breach of his corrupt agreement , he did not in fact throw matches can not , in my opinion , justify anything more than nominal damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	797	The harm to professional sporting contests if those who play them enter into corrupt bargains of the sort entered into by Mr Grobbelaar can not be overstated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	798	Proof that a professional sportsman has deliberately underperformed in a match is likely in most cases to be very difficult . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	799	All sportsmen make mistakes in the course of play . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	800	An international-class striker in a football match may miss the goal from point blank range . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	801	A wicket keeper in a cricket match may fumble a catch . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	802	A rugby player may miss a tackle or drop a high kick . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	803	These things are part of the inherent uncertainty of sport that gives sport much of its fascination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	804	Deliberate errors may be virtually impossible to prove and evidence that a professional sportsman had agreed for bribes to make deliberate errors should be enough to justify exposure and censure and enough to disentitle the sportsman in question to substantial defamation damages when a charge that he has carried out his dishonest bargain is not proved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	805	88 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	806	For these reasons I would allow the appeal but reduce Mr Grobbelaar 's damages to # 1 . 	lord scott	self	outcome	1	NAN
225	807	89 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	808	The question has been raised whether an injunction should issue against the Sun restraining it from repeating the allegation that Mr Grobbelaar had deliberately let in goals or attempted to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	809	It is normal for success in a defamation action to be accompanied by an injunction restraining the defendant tortfeasor from repeating the defamatory remarks . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	810	In the present case , however , there are , in my opinion , serious problems about the grant of an injunction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	811	First , the injunction would have to be so expressed as to permit the Sun to repeat that Mr Grobbelaar had entered into corrupt agreements to throw matches . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	812	That allegation has , in my opinion , been well proved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	813	Second , the injunction would have to be expressed so as to permit the Sun to repeat that Mr Grobbelaar had admitted throwing matches . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	814	It is common ground that Mr Grobbelaar did so admit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	815	In many contexts a comment that Mr Grobbelaar was a man who had admitted throwing matches might be taken to carry the inference that he had actually done so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	816	An injunction the breach of which might depend on what untrue inferences could be drawn by a reader from a true allegation is an injunction that would need very careful drafting . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	817	90 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	818	A third problem , and one that has caused me considerable hesitation , is that the grant of an injunction is the grant of an equitable remedy and it is long-established practice that an equitable remedy should not be granted to an applicant who does not come before the Court with `` clean hands '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	819	The grime on the hands must , of course , be sufficiently closely connected with the equitable remedy that is sought in order for an applicant to be denied a remedy to which he ordinarily would be entitled . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	820	And whether there is or is not a sufficiently close connection must depend on the facts of each case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	821	In the present case it has seemed to me well arguable that it would be an affront to the `` clean hands '' principle if an injunction were granted to Mr Grobbelaar . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	822	He entered into two successive corrupt agreements to throw matches in return for bribes and , as part of the inducement to his co-conspirator to enter into the second such agreement he represented that he had thrown or attempted to throw matches pursuant to the first such agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	823	He has brought a defamation action based first on his false denial that he entered into these agreements and , secondly , on his denial of the truth of his admission that he had thrown matches pursuant to the first agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	824	The question is whether the dishonesty that attended his entry into the corrupt agreements , and his denial in court that he had done so , so taints his success in persuading the jury to accept his denial of the truth of his match fixing admissions as to disqualify him from the grant of an injunction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	825	I can well understand that your Lordships may be concerned that , in the absence of an injunction , the Sun may repeat the allegation that Mr Grobbelaar did actually throw matches . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	826	If the Sun does so , it will be repeating that which Mr Grobbelaar has succeeded in establishing is not true . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	827	I am , somewhat reluctantly , persuaded , on balance , that the grime on Mr Grobbelaar 's hands is not such that he should be exposed to a repetition of that allegation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	828	I therefore agree that he should be given liberty to apply in this action to the High Court for the grant of a suitably worded injunction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	829	This will not , of course , be necessary if the Sun offers a suitable undertaking . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	830	91 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
225	831	For these reasons , I would allow the appeal , reduce the award of damages to # 1 and grant Mr Grobbelaar the liberty to apply that I have mentioned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
