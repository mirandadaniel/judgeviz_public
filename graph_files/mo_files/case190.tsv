190	20	BARONESS HALE OF RICHMOND 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lady hale
190	21	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lady hale
190	22	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lady hale
190	23	The issue in this appeal is whether using the words `` bloody foreigners '' and `` get back to your own country '' can transform the offence of using abusive words and behaviour with intent to cause fear or provoke violence , contrary to section 4 of the Public Order Act 1986 , into the racially aggravated form of that offence , contrary to section 31 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lady hale
190	24	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lady hale
190	25	Sections 29 to 32 of the 1998 Act create racially or religiously aggravated versions of some frequently encountered offences which vary greatly in their intrinsic seriousness : assaults falling short of grievous bodily harm with intent -LRB- section 29 -RRB- , criminal damage -LRB- section 30 -RRB- , certain public order offences -LRB- section 31 -RRB- and harassment -LRB- section 32 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lady hale
190	26	If racially or religiously aggravated , the maximum penalties are higher . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lady hale
190	27	The justification for treating such conduct more severely than the basic versions of these crimes is helpfully summarised by Ivan Hare -LRB- `` Legislating Against Hate - The Legal Response to Bias Crimes '' -LRB- 1997 -RRB- 17 OJLS 415 , 416-7 -RRB- : 6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lady hale
190	28	The court must first be satisfied that the basic offence has been committed and then that it is racially or religiously aggravated within the meaning of section 28 of the 1998 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lady hale
190	29	Subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- provides that the offence is racially or religiously aggravated if either of two different circumstances exists : One limb is therefore concerned with the outward manifestation of racial or religious hostility , the other with the inner motivation of the offender . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lady hale
190	30	Here we are concerned with the former but the point at issue arises in relation to both . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lady hale
190	31	Hostility , demonstrated or meant , is required for both , but hostility to what ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lady hale
190	32	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lady hale
190	33	The point at issue is the meaning of `` racial group '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lady hale
190	34	This is defined in section 28 -LRB- 4 -RRB- : The victims in this particular case were three young Spanish women who were walking back to the home of one of them after celebrating the birthday of another in a local restaurant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lady hale
190	35	The appellant , who is incapacitated by arthritis , was riding a mobility scooter along the pavement on his way home from a public house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lady hale
190	36	An altercation took place as he tried to get past them on the pavement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lady hale
190	37	He then pursued them in an aggressive manner into a local kebab house where they had taken refuge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lady hale
190	38	The jury must have been sure that he had used threatening , abusive or insulting words or behaviour intending them to fear immediate unlawful violence or to provoke it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lady hale
190	39	The only question was whether calling them `` bloody foreigners '' and telling them to `` go back to your own country '' demonstrated hostility based on their membership of a racial group as defined in the 1998 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lady hale
190	40	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lady hale
190	41	It is accepted on his behalf that had he called them `` bloody Spaniards '' or any other pejorative word associated with natives of the Iberian peninsular , he would have been guilty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lady hale
190	42	But it is argued that the hostility must be shown towards a particular group , rather than to foreigners as a whole . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lady hale
190	43	Mere xenophobia , it is said , does not fall within the ordinary person 's perception of hostility to a racial group . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lady hale
190	44	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lady hale
190	45	This may be true , but the definition of a racial group clearly goes beyond groups defined by their colour , race or ethnic origin . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lady hale
190	46	It encompasses both nationality -LRB- including citizenship -RRB- and national origins . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lady hale
190	47	This was quite deliberate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lady hale
190	48	In Ealing London Borough Council v Race Relations Board -LSB- 1972 -RSB- AC 342 , a majority of this House declined to interpret `` national origins '' in the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination under the Race Relations Act 1968 so as to include `` nationality '' : discriminating against the non-British was allowed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lady hale
190	49	Following this decision , the list of prohibited grounds was deliberately expanded in the Race Relations Act 1976 so as to include nationality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lady hale
190	50	The list of grounds contained in the 1976 Act was adopted for the purposes of defining racial groups in the 1998 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lady hale
190	51	An obvious advantage is that it helps to reduce argument about whether particular terms of abuse which are generally considered racist are or are not covered : does `` Paki '' , for example , demonstrate hostility towards everyone who might hail from the Indian subcontinent or only towards citizens of Pakistan ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lady hale
190	52	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lady hale
190	53	Nevertheless , it is argued for the appellant that the Act requires that the group be defined by what it is rather than by what it is not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lady hale
190	54	Hence it is argued that Spaniards are covered but foreigners , that is the non-British , are not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lady hale
190	55	The same argument would presumably be made about a person who showed hostility towards all non-whites , irrespective of the particular racial group to which they belonged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lady hale
190	56	This can not be right as a matter of language . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lady hale
190	57	Whether the group is defined exclusively by reference to what its members are not or inclusively by reference to what they are , the criterion by which the group is defined - nationality or colour - is the same . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lady hale
190	58	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lady hale
190	59	There are , as Mr David Perry QC for the respondent has pointed out , other indications that the statute intended a broad non-technical approach , rather than a construction which invited nice distinctions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lady hale
190	60	Hostility may be demonstrated at the time , or immediately before or after , the offence is committed -LRB- section 28 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lady hale
190	61	The victim may be presumed by the offender to be a member of the hated group even if she is not -LRB- section 28 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lady hale
190	62	Membership of a group includes association with members of that group -LRB- section 28 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lady hale
190	63	And the fact that the offender 's hostility is based on other factors as well racism or xenophobia is immaterial -LRB- section 28 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lady hale
190	64	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lady hale
190	65	This flexible , non-technical approach makes sense , not only as a matter of language , but also in policy terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lady hale
190	66	The mischiefs attacked by the aggravated versions of these offences are racism and xenophobia . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lady hale
190	67	Their essence is the denial of equal respect and dignity to people who are seen as `` other '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lady hale
190	68	This is more deeply hurtful , damaging and disrespectful to the victims than the simple versions of these offences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lady hale
190	69	It is also more damaging to the community as a whole , by denying acceptance to members of certain groups not for their own sake but for the sake of something they can do nothing about . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lady hale
190	70	This is just as true if the group is defined exclusively as it is if it is defined inclusively . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lady hale
190	71	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lady hale
190	72	The offences do not require particular words to be used : the necessary hostility could be demonstrated in other ways , such as the wearing of swastikas or the singing of certain songs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lady hale
190	73	But it will normally be proved by the use of some well known terms of abuse . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lady hale
190	74	Fine distinctions depending upon the particular words used would bring the law into disrepute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lady hale
190	75	This case shows that only too well but it is easy to think of other examples . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lady hale
190	76	`` Wogs begin at Calais '' demonstrates hostility to all foreigners , whereas `` bloody wogs '' might well be thought to have specific racial connotations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lady hale
190	77	`` Tinted persons '' could in certain circumstances demonstrate hostility to all non-Caucasians , while `` blacks '' might refer to a particular racial group . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lady hale
190	78	But `` black '' might equally refer to several different racial groups whose members may have very black skin . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lady hale
190	79	All are defined by reference to their race , colour , nationality , or ethic or national origins , whether there are many , several , or only one such group encompassed by the words used . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lady hale
190	80	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lady hale
190	81	It therefore comes as no surprise that the Divisional Court and Court of Appeal have generally taken the same view , as did the Court of Appeal in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lady hale
190	82	In Director of Public Prosecutions v M -LSB- 2004 -RSB- EWCA 1453 -LRB- Admin -RRB- , -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 1 WLR 2758 the Divisional Court held that `` bloody foreigners '' could , depending on the context , demonstrate hostility to a racial group . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lady hale
190	83	In Attorney General 's Reference No 4 of 2004 -LSB- 2005 -RSB- EWCA Crim 889 , -LSB- 2005 -RSB- 1 WLR 2810 the Court of Appeal held that `` someone who is an immigrant to this country and therefore non-British '' could be a member of a racial group for this purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lady hale
190	84	In R v White -LRB- Anthony -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- EWCA Crim 216 ; -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 1 WLR 1352 , it was held that `` African '' could demonstrate hostility to a racial group , because it would generally be taken to mean black African . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lady hale
190	85	However , it was doubted whether the same would apply to `` South American '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lady hale
190	86	It is not easy to imagine a scene in which hostility to South Americans as such is demonstrated , but as with `` African '' , it is quite easy to imagine a scene in which hostility is demonstrated to racial , national or ethnic groups within that continent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lady hale
190	87	The context will illuminate what the conduct shows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lady hale
190	88	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lady hale
190	89	A case which might be thought to go the other way is Director of Public Prosecutions v Pal -LSB- 2000 -RSB- Crim LR 756 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lady hale
190	90	There the Divisional Court dismissed the prosecution 's appeal when magistrates acquitted the defendant , of Asian origin , who had assaulted the victim , also of Asian origin , and called him a `` white man 's arse-licker '' and a `` brown Englishman '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lady hale
190	91	It was held that this did not demonstrate hostility towards Asians . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lady hale
190	92	But it is difficult to understand why it did not demonstrate hostility based on the victim 's presumed association with whites -LRB- within the meaning of section 28 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lady hale
190	93	That would undoubtedly cover , for example , a white woman who is targeted because she is married to a black man . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lady hale
190	94	It may well be that this way of looking at the matter did not feature in the case presented to the Divisional Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lady hale
190	95	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lady hale
190	96	The late Sir John Smith , commenting on Pal , was critical of what he saw as a further complication of our already over-complex law of offences against the person in order to meet a problem which could equally well be met by sentencing guidelines . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lady hale
190	97	But as Mr Perry has pointed out , there is an advantage for the accused in differentiating between the basic and the aggravated offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lady hale
190	98	The fact finders , whether a jury or magistrates , have then to decide whether the offence was indeed racially or religiously aggravated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lady hale
190	99	If they decide that it was not , then the offender should be sentenced on that basis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lady hale
190	100	If the offence is not covered by these provisions , it is for the sentencer to decide whether it was racially aggravated and , if it was , to treat this as an aggravating factor in sentencing -LRB- Criminal Justice Act 2003 , section 145 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lady hale
190	101	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lady hale
190	102	The Court of Appeal in this case -LSB- 2005 -RSB- EWCA Crim 2863 , -LSB- 2006 -RSB- 1 WLR 962 , para 24 , expressed some concern that If that is what the evidence suggests , of course , the normal criteria for bringing proceedings would not be met . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lady hale
190	103	There is no reason for the Crown Prosecution Service to be any more hesitant about charging these offences , if they are properly supported by the available evidence , than about any other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lady hale
190	104	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lady hale
190	105	The question certified by the Court of Appeal was : `` Do those who are not of British origin constitute a racial group within section 28 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lady hale
190	106	The answer is `` yes '' , as would it be to the question whether `` foreigners '' constitute such a group . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lady hale
190	107	Whether the evidence in any particular case , taken as a whole , proves that the offender 's conduct demonstrated hostility to such a group , or was motivated by such hostility , is a question of fact for the decision-makers in the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lady hale
190	108	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lady hale
190	109	It follows that this appeal must be dismissed . 	lady hale	self	outcome	0.9	lady hale
