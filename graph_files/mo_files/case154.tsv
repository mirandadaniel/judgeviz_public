154	2	LORD BINGHAM OF CORNHILL 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	4	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	5	I have had the great advantage of reading in draft the opinions prepared by each of my noble and learned friends . 	lord bingham	all	ackn	0	lord nicholls
154	6	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	7	The transactions which give rise to these appeals are commonplace but of great social and economic importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	8	It is important that a wife -LRB- or anyone in a like position -RRB- should not charge her interest in the matrimonial home to secure the borrowing of her husband -LRB- or anyone in a like position -RRB- without fully understanding the nature and effect of the proposed transaction and that the decision is hers , to agree or not to agree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	9	It is important that lenders should feel able to advance money , in run-of-the-mill cases with no abnormal features , on the security of the wife 's interest in the matrimonial home in reasonable confidence that , if appropriate procedures have been followed in obtaining the security , it will be enforceable if the need for enforcement arises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	10	The law must afford both parties a measure of protection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	11	It can not prescribe a code which will be proof against error , misunderstanding or mishap . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	12	But it can indicate minimum requirements which , if met , will reduce the risk of error , misunderstanding or mishap to an acceptable level . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	13	The paramount need in this important field is that these minimum requirements should be clear , simple and practically operable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	14	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	15	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	16	in my respectful opinion these minimum requirements are clearly identified in the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Scott of Foscote . 	lord bingham	lord nicholls	partagr	0	lord nicholls
154	16	in my respectful opinion these minimum requirements are clearly identified in the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Scott of Foscote . 	lord bingham	lord scott	partagr	0	lord nicholls
154	17	If these requirements are met the risk that a wife has been misled by her husband as to the facts of a proposed transaction should be eliminated or virtually so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	18	The risk that a wife has been overborne or coerced by her husband will not be eliminated but will be reduced to a level which makes it proper for the lender to proceed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	19	While the opinions of Lord Nicholls and Lord Scott show some difference of expression and approach , I do not myself discern any significant difference of legal principle applicable to these cases , and I agree with both opinions . 	lord bingham	lord nicholls	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	19	While the opinions of Lord Nicholls and Lord Scott show some difference of expression and approach , I do not myself discern any significant difference of legal principle applicable to these cases , and I agree with both opinions . 	lord bingham	lord scott	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	20	But if I am wrong and such differences exist , it is plain that the opinion of Lord Nicholls commands the unqualified support of all members of the House . 	lord bingham	lord nicholls	fullagr	0	lord nicholls
154	21	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	22	In agreement with all members of the House , I would allow the appeals of Mrs Wallace , Mrs Bennett and Desmond Banks & Co and dismiss those of Mrs Etridge and Mrs Gill , in each case for the reasons given by Lord Scott . 	lord bingham	all	fullagr	0	lord nicholls

154	23	I would allow the appeal of Mrs Harris , bearing in mind that this is an interlocutory case , for the reasons given by Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough . 	lord bingham	lord hobhouse	fullagr	0	lord nicholls

154	25	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	26	LORD NICHOLLS OF BIRKENHEAD 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	27	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	28	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	29	Before your Lordships ' House are appeals in eight cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	30	Each case arises out of a transaction in which a wife charged her interest in her home in favour of a bank as security for her husband 's indebtedness or the indebtedness of a company through which he carried on business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	31	The wife later asserted she signed the charge under the undue influence of her husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	32	In Barclays Bank Plc v O'Brien -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 180 your Lordships enunciated the principles applicable in this type of case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	33	Since then , many cases have come before the courts , testing the implications of the O'Brien decision in a variety of different factual situations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	34	Seven of the present appeals are of this character . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	35	In each case the bank sought to enforce the charge signed by the wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	36	The bank claimed an order for possession of the matrimonial home . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	37	The wife raised a defence that the bank was on notice that her concurrence in the transaction had been procured by her husband 's undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	38	The eighth appeal concerns a claim by a wife for damages from a solicitor who advised her before she entered into a guarantee obligation of this character . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	39	Undue influence 6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	40	The issues raised by these appeals make it necessary to go back to first principles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	41	Undue influence is one of the grounds of relief developed by the courts of equity as a court of conscience . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	42	The objective is to ensure that the influence of one person over another is not abused . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	43	In everyday life people constantly seek to influence the decisions of others . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	44	They seek to persuade those with whom they are dealing to enter into transactions , whether great or small . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	45	The law has set limits to the means properly employable for this purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	46	To this end the common law developed a principle of duress . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	47	Originally this was narrow in its scope , restricted to the more blatant forms of physical coercion , such as personal violence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	48	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	49	Here , as elsewhere in the law , equity supplemented the common law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	50	Equity extended the reach of the law to other unacceptable forms of persuasion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	51	The law will investigate the manner in which the intention to enter into the transaction was secured : ` how the intention was produced ' , in the oft repeated words of Lord Eldon LC , from as long ago as 1807 -LRB- Huguenin v Baseley 14 Ves 273 , 300 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	52	If the intention was produced by an unacceptable means , the law will not permit the transaction to stand . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	53	The means used is regarded as an exercise of improper or ` undue ' influence , and hence unacceptable , whenever the consent thus procured ought not fairly to be treated as the expression of a person 's free will . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	54	It is impossible to be more precise or definitive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	55	The circumstances in which one person acquires influence over another , and the manner in which influence may be exercised , vary too widely to permit of any more specific criterion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	56	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	57	Equity identified broadly two forms of unacceptable conduct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	58	The first comprises overt acts of improper pressure or coercion such as unlawful threats . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	59	Today there is much overlap with the principle of duress as this principle has subsequently developed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	60	The second form arises out of a relationship between two persons where one has acquired over another a measure of influence , or ascendancy , of which the ascendant person then takes unfair advantage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	61	An example from the 19th century , when much of this law developed , is a case where an impoverished father prevailed upon his inexperienced children to charge their reversionary interests under their parents ' marriage settlement with payment of his mortgage debts : see Bainbrigge v Browne -LRB- 1881 -RRB- 18 Ch D 188 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	62	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	63	In cases of this latter nature the influence one person has over another provides scope for misuse without any specific overt acts of persuasion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	64	The relationship between two individuals may be such that , without more , one of them is disposed to agree a course of action proposed by the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	65	Typically this occurs when one person places trust in another to look after his affairs and interests , and the latter betrays this trust by preferring his own interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	66	He abuses the influence he has acquired . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	67	In Allcard v Skinner -LRB- 1887 -RRB- 36 Ch D 145 , a case well known to every law student , Lindley LJ , at p 181 , described this class of cases as those in which it was the duty of one party to advise the other or to manage his property for him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	68	In Zamet v Hyman -LSB- 1961 -RSB- 1 WLR 1442 , 1444-1445 Lord Evershed MR referred to relationships where one party owed the other an obligation of candour and protection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	69	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	70	The law has long recognised the need to prevent abuse of influence in these ` relationship ' cases despite the absence of evidence of overt acts of persuasive conduct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	71	The types of relationship , such as parent and child , in which this principle falls to be applied can not be listed exhaustively . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	72	Relationships are infinitely various . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	73	Sir Guenter Treitel QC has rightly noted that the question is whether one party has reposed sufficient trust and confidence in the other , rather than whether the relationship between the parties belongs to a particular type : see Treitel , The Law of Contract , 10th ed -LRB- 1999 -RRB- , pp 380-381 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	74	For example , the relation of banker and customer will not normally meet this criterion , but exceptionally it may : see National Westminster Bank Plc v Morgan -LSB- 1985 -RSB- AC 686 , 707-709 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	75	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	76	Even this test is not comprehensive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	77	The principle is not confined to cases of abuse of trust and confidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	78	It also includes , for instance , cases where a vulnerable person has been exploited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	79	Indeed , there is no single touchstone for determining whether the principle is applicable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	80	Several expressions have been used in an endeavour to encapsulate the essence : trust and confidence , reliance , dependence or vulnerability on the one hand and ascendancy , domination or control on the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	81	None of these descriptions is perfect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	82	None is all embracing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	83	Each has its proper place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	84	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	85	In CIBC Mortgages Plc v Pitt -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 200 your Lordships ' House decided that in cases of undue influence disadvantage is not a necessary ingredient of the cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	86	It is not essential that the transaction should be disadvantageous to the pressurised or influenced person , either in financial terms or in any other way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	87	However , in the nature of things , questions of undue influence will not usually arise , and the exercise of undue influence is unlikely to occur , where the transaction is innocuous . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	88	The issue is likely to arise only when , in some respect , the transaction was disadvantageous either from the outset or as matters turned out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	89	Burden of proof and presumptions 13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	90	Whether a transaction was brought about by the exercise of undue influence is a question of fact . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	91	Here , as elsewhere , the general principle is that he who asserts a wrong has been committed must prove it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	92	The burden of proving an allegation of undue influence rests upon the person who claims to have been wronged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	93	This is the general rule . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	94	The evidence required to discharge the burden of proof depends on the nature of the alleged undue influence , the personality of the parties , their relationship , the extent to which the transaction can not readily be accounted for by the ordinary motives of ordinary persons in that relationship , and all the circumstances of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	95	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	96	Proof that the complainant placed trust and confidence in the other party in relation to the management of the complainant 's financial affairs , coupled with a transaction which calls for explanation , will normally be sufficient , failing satisfactory evidence to the contrary , to discharge the burden of proof . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	97	On proof of these two matters the stage is set for the court to infer that , in the absence of a satisfactory explanation , the transaction can only have been procured by undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	98	In other words , proof of these two facts is prima facie evidence that the defendant abused the influence he acquired in the parties ' relationship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	99	He preferred his own interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	100	He did not behave fairly to the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	101	So the evidential burden then shifts to him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	102	It is for him to produce evidence to counter the inference which otherwise should be drawn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	103	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	104	The case of Bainbrigge v Browne , 18 Ch D 188 , already mentioned , provides a good illustration of this commonplace type of forensic exercise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	105	Fry J held , at p 196 , that there was no direct evidence upon which he could rely as proving undue pressure by the father . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	106	But there existed circumstances ` from which the court will infer pressure and undue influence . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	107	None of the children were entirely emancipated from their father 's control . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	108	None seemed conversant with business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	109	These circumstances were such as to cast the burden of proof upon the father . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	110	He had made no attempt to discharge that burden . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	111	He did not appear in court at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	112	So the children 's claim succeeded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	113	Again , more recently , in National Westminster Bank Plc v Morgan -LSB- 1985 -RSB- AC 686 , 707 , Lord Scarman noted that a relationship of banker and customer may become one in which a banker acquires a dominating influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	114	If he does , and a manifestly disadvantageous transaction is proved , ` there would then be room ' for a court to presume that it resulted from the exercise of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	115	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	116	Generations of equity lawyers have conventionally described this situation as one in which a presumption of undue influence arises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	117	This use of the term ` presumption ' is descriptive of a shift in the evidential onus on a question of fact . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	118	When a plaintiff succeeds by this route he does so because he has succeeded in establishing a case of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	119	The court has drawn appropriate inferences of fact upon a balanced consideration of the whole of the evidence at the end of a trial in which the burden of proof rested upon the plaintiff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	120	The use , in the course of the trial , of the forensic tool of a shift in the evidential burden of proof should not be permitted to obscure the overall position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	121	These cases are the equitable counterpart of common law cases where the principle of res ipsa loquitur is invoked . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	122	There is a rebuttable evidential presumption of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	123	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	124	The availability of this forensic tool in cases founded on abuse of influence arising from the parties ' relationship has led to this type of case sometimes being labelled ` presumed undue influence ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	125	This is by way of contrast with cases involving actual pressure or the like , which are labelled ` actual undue influence ' : see Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA v Aboody -LSB- 1990 -RSB- I QB 923 , 953 , and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc v Etridge -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 1998 -RSB- 4 All ER 705 , 711-712 , paras 5-7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
154	126	This usage can be a little confusing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	127	In many cases where a plaintiff has claimed that the defendant abused the influence he acquired in a relationship of trust and confidence the plaintiff has succeeded by recourse to the rebuttable evidential presumption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	128	But this need not be so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	129	Such a plaintiff may succeed even where this presumption is not available to him ; for instance , where the impugned transaction was not one which called for an explanation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	130	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	131	The evidential presumption discussed above is to be distinguished sharply from a different form of presumption which arises in some cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	132	The law has adopted a sternly protective attitude towards certain types of relationship in which one party acquires influence over another who is vulnerable and dependent and where , moreover , substantial gifts by the influenced or vulnerable person are not normally to be expected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	133	Examples of relationships within this special class are parent and child , guardian and ward , trustee and beneficiary , solicitor and client , and medical adviser and patient . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	134	In these cases the law presumes , irrebuttably , that one party had influence over the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	135	The complainant need not prove he actually reposed trust and confidence in the other party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	136	It is sufficient for him to prove the existence of the type of relationship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	137	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	138	It is now well established that husband and wife is not one of the relationships to which this latter principle applies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	139	In Yerkey v Jones -LRB- 1939 -RRB- 63 CLR 649 , 675 Dixon J explained the reason . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	140	The Court of Chancery was not blind to the opportunities of obtaining and unfairly using influence over a wife which a husband often possesses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	141	But there is nothing unusual or strange in a wife , from motives of affection or for other reasons , conferring substantial financial benefits on her husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	142	Although there is no presumption , the court will nevertheless note , as a matter of fact , the opportunities for abuse which flow from a wife 's confidence in her husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	143	The court will take this into account with all the other evidence in the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	144	Where there is evidence that a husband has taken unfair advantage of his influence over his wife , or her confidence in him , ` it is not difficult for the wife to establish her title to relief ' : see In re Lloyds Bank Ltd , Bomze v Bomze -LSB- 1931 -RSB- 1 Ch 289 , at p 302 , per Maugham J. Independent advice 20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	145	Proof that the complainant received advice from a third party before entering into the impugned transaction is one of the matters a court takes into account when weighing all the evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	146	The weight , or importance , to be attached to such advice depends on all the circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	147	In the normal course , advice from a solicitor or other outside adviser can be expected to bring home to a complainant a proper understanding of what he or she is about to do . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	148	But a person may understand fully the implications of a proposed transaction , for instance , a substantial gift , and yet still be acting under the undue influence of another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	149	Proof of outside advice does not , of itself , necessarily show that the subsequent completion of the transaction was free from the exercise of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	150	Whether it will be proper to infer that outside advice had an emancipating effect , so that the transaction was not brought about by the exercise of undue influence , is a question of fact to be decided having regard to all the evidence in the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	151	Manifest disadvantage 21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	152	As already noted , there are two prerequisites to the evidential shift in the burden of proof from the complainant to the other party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	153	First , that the complainant reposed trust and confidence in the other party , or the other party acquired ascendancy over the complainant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	154	Second , that the transaction is not readily explicable by the relationship of the parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	155	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	156	Lindley LJ summarised this second prerequisite in the leading authority of Allcard v Skinner , 36 Ch D 145 , where the donor parted with almost all her property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	157	Lindley LJ pointed out that where a gift of a small amount is made to a person standing in a confidential relationship to the donor , some proof of the exercise of the influence of the donee must be given . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	158	The mere existence of the influence is not enough . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	159	He continued , at p 185 : ` But if the gift is so large as not to be reasonably accounted for on the ground of friendship , relationship , charity , or other ordinary motives on which ordinary men act , the burden is upon the donee to support the gift . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	160	In Bank of Montreal v Stuart -LSB- 1911 -RSB- AC 120 , 137 Lord Macnaghten used the phrase ` immoderate and irrational ' to describe this concept . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	161	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	162	The need for this second prerequisite has recently been questioned : see Nourse LJ in Barclays Bank Plc v Coleman -LSB- 2001 -RSB- QB , 20 , 30-32 , one of the cases under appeal before your Lordships ' House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	163	Mr Sher QC invited your Lordships to depart from the decision of the House on this point in National Westminster Bank Plc v Morgan -LSB- 1985 -RSB- AC 686 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls

154	165	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	166	this is not an invitation I would accept . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	167	The second prerequisite , as expressed by Lindley LJ , is good sense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	168	It is a necessary limitation upon the width of the first prerequisite . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	169	It would be absurd for the law to presume that every gift by a child to a parent , or every transaction between a client and his solicitor or between a patient and his doctor , was brought about by undue influence unless the contrary is affirmatively proved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	170	Such a presumption would be too far-reaching . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	171	The law would out of touch with everyday life if the presumption were to apply to every Christmas or birthday gift by a child to a parent , or to an agreement whereby a client or patient agrees to be responsible for the reasonable fees of his legal or medical adviser . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	172	The law would be rightly open to ridicule , for transactions such as these are unexceptionable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	173	They do not suggest that something may be amiss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	174	So something more is needed before the law reverses the burden of proof , something which calls for an explanation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	175	When that something more is present , the greater the disadvantage to the vulnerable person , the more cogent must be the explanation before the presumption will be regarded as rebutted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	176	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	177	This was the approach adopted by Lord Scarman in National Westminster Bank Plc v Morgan -LSB- 1985 -RSB- AC 686 , 703-707 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	178	He cited Lindley LJ 's observations in Allcard v Skinner , 36 Ch D 145 , 185 , which I have set out above . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	179	He noted that whatever the legal character of the transaction , it must constitute a disadvantage sufficiently serious to require evidence to rebut the presumption that in the circumstances of the parties ' relationship , it was procured by the exercise of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	180	Lord Scarman concluded , at p 704 : ` The Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the presumption of undue influence can arise from the evidence of the relationship of the parties without also evidence that the transaction itself was wrongful in that it constituted an advantage taken of the person subjected to the influence which , failing proof to the contrary , was explicable only on the basis that undue influence had been exercised to procure it . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	181	-LRB- Emphasis added -RRB- 26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	182	Lord Scarman attached the label ` manifest disadvantage ' to this second ingredient necessary to raise the presumption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	183	This label has been causing difficulty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	184	It may be apt enough when applied to straightforward transactions such as a substantial gift or a sale at an undervalue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	185	But experience has now shown that this expression can give rise to misunderstanding . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	186	The label is being understood and applied in a way which does not accord with the meaning intended by Lord Scarman , its originator . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	187	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	188	The problem has arisen in the context of wives guaranteeing payment of their husband 's business debts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	189	In recent years judge after judge has grappled with the baffling question whether a wife 's guarantee of her husband 's bank overdraft , together with a charge on her share of the matrimonial home , was a transaction manifestly to her disadvantage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	190	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	191	In a narrow sense , such a transaction plainly -LRB- ` manifestly ' -RRB- is disadvantageous to the wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	192	She undertakes a serious financial obligation , and in return she personally receives nothing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	193	But that would be to take an unrealistically blinkered view of such a transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	194	Unlike the relationship of solicitor and client or medical adviser and patient , in the case of husband and wife there are inherent reasons why such a transaction may well be for her benefit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	195	Ordinarily , the fortunes of husband and wife are bound up together . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	196	If the husband 's business is the source of the family income , the wife has a lively interest in doing what she can to support the business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	197	A wife 's affection and self-interest run hand-in-hand in inclining her to join with her husband in charging the matrimonial home , usually a jointly-owned asset , to obtain the financial facilities needed by the business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	198	The finance may be needed to start a new business , or expand a promising business , or rescue an ailing business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	199	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	200	Which , then , is the correct approach to adopt in deciding whether a transaction is disadvantageous to the wife : the narrow approach , or the wider approach ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	201	The answer is neither . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	202	The answer lies in discarding a label which gives rise to this sort of ambiguity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	203	The better approach is to adhere more directly to the test outlined by Lindley LJ in Allcard v Skinner , 36 Ch D 145 , and adopted by Lord Scarman in National Westminster Bank Plc v Morgan -LSB- 1985 -RSB- AC 686 , in the passages I have cited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	204	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	205	I return to husband and wife cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	206	I do not think that , in the ordinary course , a guarantee of the character I have mentioned is to be regarded as a transaction which , failing proof to the contrary , is explicable only on the basis that it has been procured by the exercise of undue influence by the husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	207	Wives frequently enter into such transactions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	208	There are good and sufficient reasons why they are willing to do so , despite the risks involved for them and their families . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	209	They may be enthusiastic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	210	They may not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	211	They may be less optimistic than their husbands about the prospects of the husbands ' businesses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	212	They may be anxious , perhaps exceedingly so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	213	But this is a far cry from saying that such transactions as a class are to be regarded as prima facie evidence of the exercise of undue influence by husbands . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	214	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	215	I have emphasised the phrase ` in the ordinary course ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	216	There will be cases where a wife 's signature of a guarantee or a charge of her share in the matrimonial home does call for explanation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	217	Nothing I have said above is directed at such a case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	218	A cautionary note 32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	219	I add a cautionary note , prompted by some of the first instance judgments in the cases currently being considered by the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	220	It concerns the general approach to be adopted by a court when considering whether a wife 's guarantee of her husband 's bank overdraft was procured by her husband 's undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	221	Undue influence has a connotation of impropriety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	222	In the eye of the law , undue influence means that influence has been misused . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	223	Statements or conduct by a husband which do not pass beyond the bounds of what may be expected of a reasonable husband in the circumstances should not , without more , be castigated as undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	224	Similarly , when a husband is forecasting the future of his business , and expressing his hopes or fears , a degree of hyperbole may be only natural . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	225	Courts should not too readily treat such exaggerations as misstatements . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	226	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	227	Inaccurate explanations of a proposed transaction are a different matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	228	So are cases where a husband , in whom a wife has reposed trust and confidence for the management of their financial affairs , prefers his interests to hers and makes a choice for both of them on that footing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	229	Such a husband abuses the influence he has . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	230	He fails to discharge the obligation of candour and fairness he owes a wife who is looking to him to make the major financial decisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	231	The complainant and third parties : suretyship transactions 34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	232	The problem considered in O'Brien 's case and raised by the present appeals is of comparatively recent origin . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	233	It arises out of the substantial growth in home ownership over the last 30 or 40 years and , as part of that development , the great increase in the number of homes owned jointly by husbands and wives . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	234	More than two-thirds of householders in the United Kingdom now own their own homes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	235	For most home-owning couples , their homes are their most valuable asset . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	236	They must surely be free , if they so wish , to use this asset as a means of raising money , whether for the purpose of the husband 's business or for any other purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	237	Their home is their property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	238	The law should not restrict them in the use they may make of it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	239	Bank finance is in fact by far the most important source of external capital for small businesses with fewer than ten employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	240	These businesses comprise about 95 percent of all businesses in the country , responsible for nearly one-third of all employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	241	Finance raised by second mortgages on the principal 's home is a significant source of capital for the start-up of small businesses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	242	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	243	If the freedom of home-owners to make economic use of their homes is not to be frustrated , a bank must be able to have confidence that a wife 's signature of the necessary guarantee and charge will be as binding upon her as is the signature of anyone else on documents which he or she may sign . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	244	Otherwise banks will not be willing to lend money on the security of a jointly owned house or flat . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	245	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	246	At the same time , the high degree of trust and confidence and emotional interdependence which normally characterises a marriage relationship provides scope for abuse . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	247	One party may take advantage of the other 's vulnerability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	248	Unhappily , such abuse does occur . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	249	Further , it is all too easy for a husband , anxious or even desperate for bank finance , to misstate the position in some particular or to mislead the wife , wittingly or unwittingly , in some other way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	250	The law would be seriously defective if it did not recognise these realities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	251	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	252	In O'Brien 's case this House decided where the balance should be held between these competing interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	253	On the one side , there is the need to protect a wife against a husband 's undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	254	On the other side , there is the need for the bank to be able to have reasonable confidence in the strength of its security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	255	Otherwise it would not provide the required money . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	256	The problem lies in finding the course best designed to protect wives in a minority of cases without unreasonably hampering the giving and taking of security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	257	The House produced a practical solution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	258	The House decided what are the steps a bank should take to ensure it is not affected by any claim the wife may have that her signature of the documents was procured by the undue influence or other wrong of her husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	259	Like every compromise , the outcome falls short of achieving in full the objectives of either of the two competing interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	260	In particular , the steps required of banks will not guarantee that , in future , wives will not be subjected to undue influence or misled when standing as sureties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	261	Short of prohibiting this type of suretyship transaction altogether , there is no way of achieving that result , desirable although it is . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	262	What passes between a husband and wife in this regard in the privacy of their own home is not capable of regulation or investigation as a prelude to the wife entering into a suretyship transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	263	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	264	The jurisprudential route by which the House reached its conclusion in O'Brien 's case has attracted criticism from some commentators . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	265	It has been said to involve artificiality and thereby create uncertainty in the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	266	I must first consider this criticism . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	267	In the ordinary course a bank which takes a guarantee security from the wife of its customer will be altogether ignorant of any undue influence the customer may have exercised in order to secure the wife 's concurrence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	268	In O'Brien Lord Browne-Wilkinson prayed in aid the doctrine of constructive notice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	269	In circumstances he identified , a creditor is put on inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	270	When that is so , the creditor ` will have constructive notice of the wife 's rights ' unless the creditor takes reasonable steps to satisfy himself that the wife 's agreement to stand surety has been properly obtained : see -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 180 , 196 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	271	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	272	Lord Browne-Wilkinson would be the first to recognise this is not a conventional use of the equitable concept of constructive notice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	273	The traditional use of this concept concerns the circumstances in which a transferee of property who acquires a legal estate from a transferor with a defective title may nonetheless obtain a good title , that is , a better title than the transferor had . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	274	That is not the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	275	The bank acquires its charge from the wife , and there is nothing wrong with her title to her share of the matrimonial home . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	276	The transferor wife is seeking to resile from the very transaction she entered into with the bank , on the ground that her apparent consent was procured by the undue influence or other misconduct , such as misrepresentation , of a third party -LRB- her husband -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	277	She is seeking to set aside her contract of guarantee and , with it , the charge she gave to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	278	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	279	The traditional view of equity in this tripartite situation seems to be that a person in the position of the wife will only be relieved of her bargain if the other party to the transaction -LRB- the bank , in the present instance -RRB- was privy to the conduct which led to the wife 's entry into the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	280	Knowledge is required : see Cobbett v Brock -LRB- 1855 -RRB- 20 Beav 524 , 528 , 531 , per Sir John Romilly MR , Kempson v Ashbee -LRB- 1874 -RRB- LR 10 Ch App 15 , 21 , per James LJ , and Bainbrigge v Browne , 18 Ch D 188 , 197 , per Fry J . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	281	The law imposes no obligation on one party to a transaction to check whether the other party 's concurrence was obtained by undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	282	But O'Brien has introduced into the law the concept that , in certain circumstances , a party to a contract may lose the benefit of his contract , entered into in good faith , if he ought to have known that the other 's concurrence had been procured by the misconduct of a third party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	283	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	284	There is a further respect in which O'Brien departed from conventional concepts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	285	Traditionally , a person is deemed to have notice -LRB- that is , he has ` constructive ' notice -RRB- of a prior right when he does not actually know of it but would have learned of it had he made the requisite inquiries . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	286	A purchaser will be treated as having constructive notice of all that a reasonably prudent purchaser would have discovered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	287	In the present type of case , the steps a bank is required to take , lest it have constructive notice that the wife 's concurrence was procured improperly by her husband , do not consist of making inquiries . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	288	Rather , O'Brien envisages that the steps taken by the bank will reduce , or even eliminate , the risk of the wife entering into the transaction under any misapprehension or as a result of undue influence by her husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	289	The steps are not concerned to discover whether the wife has been wronged by her husband in this way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	290	The steps are concerned to minimise the risk that such a wrong may be committed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	291	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	292	These novelties do not point to the conclusion that the decision of this House in O'Brien is leading the law astray . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	293	Lord Browne-Wilkinson acknowledged he might be extending the law : see -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 180 , 197 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	294	Some development was sorely needed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	295	The law had to find a way of giving wives a reasonable measure of protection , without adding unreasonably to the expense involved in entering into guarantee transactions of the type under consideration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	296	The protection had to extend also to any misrepresentations made by a husband to his wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	297	In a situation where there is a substantial risk the husband may exercise his influence improperly regarding the provision of security for his business debts , there is an increased risk that explanations of the transaction given by him to his wife may be misleadingly incomplete or even inaccurate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	298	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	299	The route selected in O'Brien ought not to have an unsettling effect on established principles of contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	300	O'Brien concerned suretyship transactions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	301	These are tripartite transactions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	302	They involve the debtor as well as the creditor and the guarantor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	303	The guarantor enters into the transaction at the request of the debtor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	304	The guarantor assumes obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	305	On the face of the transaction the guarantor usually receives no benefit in return , unless the guarantee is being given on a commercial basis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	306	Leaving aside cases where the relationship between the surety and the debtor is commercial , a guarantee transaction is one-sided so far as the guarantor is concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	307	The creditor knows this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	308	Thus the decision in O'Brien is directed at a class of contracts which has special features of its own . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	309	That said , I must at a later stage in this speech return to the question of the wider implications of the O'Brien decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	310	The threshold : when the bank is put on inquiry 44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	311	In O'Brien the House considered the circumstances in which a bank , or other creditor , is ` put on inquiry . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	312	Strictly this is a misnomer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	313	As already noted , a bank is not required to make inquiries . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	314	But it will be convenient to use the terminology which has now become accepted in this context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	315	The House set a low level for the threshold which must be crossed before a bank is put on inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	316	For practical reasons the level is set much lower than is required to satisfy a court that , failing contrary evidence , the court may infer that the transaction was procured by undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	317	Lord Browne-Wilkinson said -LRB- -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 180 , 196 -RRB- : ` Therefore in my judgment a creditor in put on inquiry when a wife offers to stand surety for her husband 's debts by the combination of two factors : -LRB- a -RRB- the transaction is on its face not to the financial advantage of the wife ; and -LRB- b -RRB- there is a substantial risk in transactions of that kind that , in procuring the wife to act as surety , the husband has committed a legal or equitable wrong that entitles the wife to set aside the transaction . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	318	In my view , this passage , read in context , is to be taken to mean , quite simply , that a bank is put on inquiry whenever a wife offers to stand surety for her husband 's debts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	319	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	320	The Court of Appeal , comprising Stuart-Smith , Millett and Morritt LJJ , interpreted this passage more restrictively . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	321	The threshold , the court said , is somewhat higher . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	322	Where condition -LRB- a -RRB- is satisfied , the bank is put on inquiry if , but only if , the bank is aware that the parties are cohabiting or that the particular surety places implicit trust and confidence in the principal debtor in relation to her financial affairs : see Royal Bank of Scotland Plc v Etridge -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 1998 -RSB- 4 All ER 705 , 719 .

154	326	I do not understand Lord Browne-Wilkinson to have been saying that , in husband and wife cases , whether the bank is put on inquiry depends on its state of knowledge of the parties ' marriage , or of the degree of trust and confidence the particular wife places in her husband in relation to her financial affairs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	327	That would leave banks in a state of considerable uncertainty in a situation where it is important they should know clearly where they stand . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	328	The test should be simple and clear and easy to apply in a wide range of circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	329	I read -LRB- a -RRB- and -LRB- b -RRB- as Lord Browne-Wilkinson 's broad explanation of the reason why a creditor is put on inquiry when a wife offers to stand surety for her husband 's debts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	330	These are the two factors which , taken together , constitute the underlying rationale . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls

154	332	The position is likewise if the husband stands surety for his wife 's debts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	333	Similarly , in the case of unmarried couples , whether heterosexual or homosexual , where the bank is aware of the relationship : see Lord Browne-Wilkinson in O'Brien 's case , at p 198 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls

154	337	As to the type of transactions where a bank is put on inquiry , the case where a wife becomes surety for her husband 's debts is , in this context , a straightforward case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	338	The bank is put on inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	339	On the other side of the line is the case where money is being advanced , or has been advanced , to husband and wife jointly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	340	In such a case the bank is not put on inquiry , unless the bank is aware the loan is being made for the husband 's purposes , as distinct from their joint purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	341	That was decided in CIBC Mortgages Plc v Pitt -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 200 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	342	49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	343	Less clear cut is the case where the wife becomes surety for the debts of a company whose shares are held by her and her husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	344	Her shareholding may be nominal , or she may have a minority shareholding or an equal shareholding with her husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	345	In my view the bank is put on inquiry in such cases , even when the wife is a director or secretary of the company . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	346	Such cases can not be equated with joint loans . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	347	The shareholding interests , and the identity of the directors , are not a reliable guide to the identity of the persons who actually have the conduct of the company 's business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	348	The steps a bank should take 50 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	349	The principal area of controversy on these appeals concerns the steps a bank should take when it has been put on inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	350	In O'Brien Lord Browne-Wilkinson , at -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 180 , 196-197 , said that a bank can reasonably be expected to take steps to bring home to the wife the risk she is running by standing as surety and to advise her to take independent advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	351	That test is applicable to past transactions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	352	All the cases now before your Lordships ' House fall into this category . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	353	For the future a bank satisfies these requirements if it insists that the wife attend a private meeting with a representative of the bank at which she is told of the extent of her liability as surety , warned of the risk she is running and urged to take independent legal advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	354	In exceptional cases the bank , to be safe , has to insist that the wife is separately advised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	355	51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	356	The practice of the banks involved in the present cases , and it seems reasonable to assume this is the practice of banks generally , is not to have a private meeting with the wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	357	Nor do the banks themselves take any other steps to bring home to the wife the risk she is running . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	358	This has continued to be the practice since the decision in O'Brien 's case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	359	Banks consider they would stand to lose more than they would gain by holding a private meeting with the wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	360	They are , apparently , unwilling to assume the responsibility of advising the wife at such a meeting . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	361	Instead , the banking practice remains , as before , that in general the bank requires a wife to seek legal advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	362	The bank seeks written confirmation from a solicitor that he has explained the nature and effect of the documents to the wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	363	52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	364	Many of the difficulties which have arisen in the present cases stem from serious deficiencies , or alleged deficiencies , in the quality of the legal advice given to the wives . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	365	I say ` alleged ' , because three of the appeals before your Lordships ' House have not proceeded beyond the interlocutory stage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	366	The banks successfully applied for summary judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	367	In these cases the wife 's allegations , made in affidavit form , have not been tested by cross-examination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	368	On behalf of the wives it has been submitted that under the current practice the legal advice is often perfunctory in the extreme and , further , that everyone , including the banks , knows this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	369	Independent legal advice is a fiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	370	The system is a charade . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	371	In practice it provides little or no protection for a wife who is under a misapprehension about the risks involved or who is being coerced into signing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	372	She may not even know the present state of her husband 's indebtedness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	373	53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	374	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	375	it is plainly neither desirable nor practicable that banks should be required to attempt to discover for themselves whether a wife 's consent is being procured by the exercise of undue influence of her husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
154	376	This is not a step the banks should be expected to take . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	377	Nor , further , is it desirable or practicable that banks should be expected to insist on confirmation from a solicitor that the solicitor has satisfied himself that the wife 's consent has not been procured by undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	378	As already noted , the circumstances in which banks are put on inquiry are extremely wide . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	379	They embrace every case where a wife is entering into a suretyship transaction in respect of her husband 's debts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	380	Many , if not most , wives would be understandably outraged by having to respond to the sort of questioning which would be appropriate before a responsible solicitor could give such a confirmation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	381	In any event , solicitors are not equipped to carry out such an exercise in any really worthwhile way , and they will usually lack the necessary materials . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	382	Moreover , the legal costs involved , which would inevitably fall on the husband who is seeking financial assistance from the bank , would be substantial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	383	To require such an intrusive , inconclusive and expensive exercise in every case would be an altogether disproportionate response to the need to protect those cases , presumably a small minority , where a wife is being wronged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	384	54 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	385	The furthest a bank can be expected to go is to take reasonable steps to satisfy itself that the wife has had brought home to her , in a meaningful way , the practical implications of the proposed transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	386	This does not wholly eliminate the risk of undue influence or misrepresentation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	387	But it does mean that a wife enters into a transaction with her eyes open so far as the basic elements of the transaction are concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	388	55 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	389	This is the point at which , in the O'Brien case , the House decided that the balance between the competing interests should be held . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	390	A bank may itself provide the necessary information directly to the wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	391	Indeed , it is best equipped to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	392	But banks are not following that course . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	393	Ought they to be obliged to do so in every case ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	394	I do not think Lord Browne-Wilkinson so stated in O'Brien . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	395	I do not understand him to have said that a personal meeting was the only way a bank could discharge its obligation to bring home to the wife the risks she is running . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	396	It seems to me that , provided a suitable alternative is available , banks ought not to be compelled to take this course . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	397	Their reasons for not wishing to hold a personal meeting are understandable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	398	Commonly , when a bank seeks to enforce a security provided by a customer , it is met with a defence based on assurances alleged to have been given orally by a branch manager at an earlier stage : that the bank would continue to support the business , that the bank would not call in its loan , and so forth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	399	Lengthy litigation ensues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	400	Sometimes the allegations prove to be well founded , sometimes not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	401	Banks are concerned to avoid the prospect of similar litigation which would arise in guarantee cases if they were to adopt a practice of holding a meeting with a wife at which the bank 's representative would explain the proposed guarantee transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	402	It is not unreasonable for the banks to prefer that this task should be undertaken by an independent legal adviser . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	403	56 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	404	I shall return later to the steps a bank should take when it follows this course . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	405	Suffice to say , these steps , together with advice from a solicitor acting for the wife , ought to provide the substance of the protection which O'Brien intended a wife should have . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	406	Ordinarily it will be reasonable that a bank should be able to rely upon confirmation from a solicitor , acting for the wife , that he has advised the wife appropriately . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	407	57 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	408	The position will be otherwise if the bank knows that the solicitor has not duly advised the wife or , I would add , if the bank knows facts from which it ought to have realised that the wife has not received the appropriate advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	409	In such circumstances the bank will proceed at its own risk . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	410	The content of the legal advice 58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	411	In Royal Bank of Scotland Plc v Etridge -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 1998 -RSB- 4 All ER 705 , 715 , para 19 , the Court of Appeal set out its views of the duties of a solicitor in this context : ' A solicitor who is instructed to advise a person who may be subject to the undue influence of another must bear in mind that it is not sufficient that she understands the nature and effect of the transaction if she is so affected by the influence of the other that she can not make an independent decision of her own . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	412	It is not sufficient to explain the documentation and ensure she understands the nature of the transaction and wishes to carry it out : see Powell v Powell -LSB- 1900 -RSB- 1 Ch 243 , 247 , approved in Wright v Carter -LSB- 1903 -RSB- 1 Ch 27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	413	His duty is to satisfy himself that his client is free from improper influence , and the first step must be to ascertain whether it is one into which she could sensibly be advised to enter if free from such influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	414	If he is not so satisfied , it is his duty to advise her not to enter into it , and to refuse to act further for her in the implementation of the transaction if she persists . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	415	In this event , while the contents of his advice must remain confidential , he should inform the other parties -LRB- including the bank -RRB- that he has seen his client and given her certain advice , and that as a result he has declined to act for her any further . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	416	He must in any event advise her that she is under no obligation to enter into the transaction at all and , if she still wishes to do so , that she is not bound to accept the terms of any document which has been put before her : see Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland NV v Burch -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 1 All ER 144 .

154	418	I am unable to accept this as an accurate formulation of a solicitor 's duties in cases such as those now under consideration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	419	In some respects it goes much too far . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	420	The observations of Farwell J in Powell v Powell -LSB- 1900 -RSB- 1 Ch 243 , 247 , should not be pressed unduly widely . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	421	Powell v Powell was a case where strong moral pressure was applied by a stepmother to a girl who was only just twenty one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	422	She was regarded as not really capable of dealing irrevocably with her parent or guardian in the matter of a substantial settlement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	423	Farwell J 's observations can not be regarded as of general application in all cases where a solicitor is giving advice to a person who may have been subject to undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	424	60 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	425	More pertinently , in In re Coomber , Coomber v Coomber -LSB- 1911 -RSB- 1 Ch 723 , 730 , Fletcher Moulton LJ summarised the general rules applicable to cases of persons who are competent to form an opinion of their own : ` All that is necessary is that some independent person , free from any taint of the relationship , or of the consideration of interest which would affect the act , should put clearly before the person what are the nature and the consequences of the act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	426	It is for adult persons of competent mind to decide whether they will do an act , and I do not think that independent and competent advice means independent and competent approval . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	427	It simply means that the advice shall be removed entirely from the suspected atmosphere ; and that from the clear language of an independent mind , they should know precisely what they are doing . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	428	61 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	429	Thus , in the present type of case it is not for the solicitor to veto the transaction by declining to confirm to the bank that he has explained the documents to the wife and the risks she is taking upon herself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	430	If the solicitor considers the transaction is not in the wife 's best interests , he will give reasoned advice to the wife to that effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	431	But at the end of the day the decision on whether to proceed is the decision of the client , not the solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls

154	434	That is the general rule . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls

154	437	In Wright v Carter -LSB- 1903 -RSB- 1 Ch 27 , 57-58 , Stirling LJ approved Farwell J 's observations in Powell v Powell -LSB- 1900 -RSB- 1 Ch 243 , 247 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls

154	440	In Royal Bank of Scotland Plc v Etridge -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 1998 -RSB- 4 All ER 705 , 722 , para 49 , the Court of Appeal said that if the transaction is ` one into which no competent solicitor could properly advise the wife to enter ' , the availability of legal advice is insufficient to avoid the bank being fixed with constructive notice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	441	It follows from the views expressed above that I am unable to agree with the Court of Appeal on this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	442	64 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	443	I turn to consider the scope of the responsibilities of a solicitor who is advising the wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	444	In identifying what are the solicitor 's responsibilities the starting point must always be the solicitor 's retainer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	445	What has he been retained to do ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	446	As a general proposition , the scope of a solicitor 's duties is dictated by the terms , whether express or implied , of his retainer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	447	In the type of case now under consideration the relevant retainer stems from the bank 's concern to receive confirmation from the solicitor that , in short , the solicitor has brought home to the wife the risks involved in the proposed transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	448	As a first step the solicitor will need to explain to the wife the purpose for which he has become involved at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	449	He should explain that , should it ever become necessary , the bank will rely upon his involvement to counter any suggestion that the wife was overborne by her husband or that she did not properly understand the implications of the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	450	The solicitor will need to obtain confirmation from the wife that she wishes him to act for her in the matter and to advise her on the legal and practical implications of the proposed transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	451	65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	452	When an instruction to this effect is forthcoming , the content of the advice required from a solicitor before giving the confirmation sought by the bank will , inevitably , depend upon the circumstances of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	453	Typically , the advice a solicitor can be expected to give should cover the following matters as the core minimum . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls

154	460	She should be told the amount of her liability under her guarantee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls

154	466	Explanation of the choice facing the wife will call for some discussion of the present financial position , including the amount of the husband 's present indebtedness , and the amount of his current overdraft facility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	467	-LRB- 4 -RRB- The solicitor should check whether the wife wishes to proceed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	468	She should be asked whether she is content that the solicitor should write to the bank confirming he has explained to her the nature of the documents and the practical implications they may have for her , or whether , for instance , she would prefer him to negotiate with the bank on the terms of the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	469	Matters for negotiation could include the sequence in which the various securities will be called upon or a specific or lower limit to her liabilities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	470	The solicitor should not give any confirmation to the bank without the wife 's authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	471	66 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	472	The solicitor 's discussion with the wife should take place at a face-to-face meeting , in the absence of the husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	473	It goes without saying that the solicitor 's explanations should be couched in suitably non-technical language . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	474	It also goes without saying that the solicitor 's task is an important one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	475	It is not a formality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	476	67 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	477	The solicitor should obtain from the bank any information he needs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	478	If the bank fails for any reason to provide information requested by the solicitor , the solicitor should decline to provide the confirmation sought by the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	479	68 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	480	As already noted , the advice which a solicitor can be expected to give must depend on the particular facts of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	481	But I have set out this ` core minimum ' in some detail , because the quality of the legal advice is the most disturbing feature of some of the present appeals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	482	The perfunctory nature of the advice may well be largely due to a failure by some solicitors to understand what is required in these cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	483	Independent advice 69 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	484	I turn next to the much-vexed question whether the solicitor advising the wife must act for the wife alone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	485	Or , at the very least , the solicitor must not act for the husband or the bank in the current transaction save in a wholly ministerial capacity , such as carrying out conveyancing formalities or supervising the execution of documents and witnessing signatures . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	486	Commonly , in practice , the solicitor advising the wife will be the solicitor acting also for her husband either in the particular transaction or generally . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	487	70 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	488	The first point to note is that this question can not be answered by reference to reported decisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	489	The steps a bank must take once it is put on inquiry , if it is to avoid having constructive notice of the wife 's rights , are not the subject of exposition in earlier authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	490	This is a novel situation , created by the O'Brien decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	491	71 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	492	Next , a simple and clear rule is needed , preferably of well nigh universal application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	493	In some cases a bank deals directly with a husband and wife and has to take the initiative in requiring the wife to obtain legal advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	494	In other cases , a bank may deal throughout with solicitors already acting for the husband and wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	495	The case of Bank of Baroda v Rayarel -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 2 FLR 376 is an example of the latter type of case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	496	It would not be satisfactory to attempt to draw a distinction along these lines . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	497	Any such distinction would lack a principled base . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	498	Inevitably , in practice , the distinction would disintegrate in confusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	499	72 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	500	Thirdly , here again , a balancing exercise is called for . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	501	Some features point in one direction , others in the opposite direction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	502	Factors favouring the need for the solicitor to act for the wife alone include the following . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	503	Sometimes a wife may be inhibited in discussion with a solicitor who is also acting for the husband or whose main client is the husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	504	This occurred in Banco Exterior Internacional v Mann -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 1 All ER 936 : see the finding of the judge , at p 941F-G . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	505	Sometimes a solicitor whose main client is the husband may not , in practice , give the same single-minded attention to the wife 's position as would a solicitor acting solely for the wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	506	Her interests may rank lower in the solicitor 's scale of priorities , perhaps unconsciously , than the interests of the husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	507	Instances of incompetent advice , or worse , which have come before the court might perhaps be less likely to recur if a solicitor were instructed to act for the wife alone and gave advice solely to her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	508	As a matter of general understanding , independent advice would suggest that the solicitor should not be acting in the same transaction for the person who , if there is any undue influence , is the source of that influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	509	73 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	510	The contrary view is that the solicitor may also act for the husband or the bank , provided the solicitor is satisfied that this is in the wife 's best interests and satisfied also that this will not give rise to any conflicts of duty or interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	511	The principal factors favouring this approach are as follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	512	A requirement that a wife should receive advice from a solicitor acting solely for her will frequently add significantly to the legal costs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	513	Sometimes a wife will be happier to be advised by a family solicitor known to her than by a complete stranger . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	514	Sometimes a solicitor who knows both husband and wife and their histories will be better placed to advise than a solicitor who is a complete stranger . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	515	74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	516	In my view , overall the latter factors are more weighty than the former . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	517	The advantages attendant upon the employment of a solicitor acting solely for the wife do not justify the additional expense this would involve for the husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	518	When accepting instructions to advise the wife the solicitor assumes responsibilities directly to her , both at law and professionally . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	519	These duties , and this is central to the reasoning on this point , are owed to the wife alone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	520	In advising the wife the solicitor is acting for the wife alone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	521	He is concerned only with her interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	522	I emphasise , therefore , that in every case the solicitor must consider carefully whether there is any conflict of duty or interest and , more widely , whether it would be in the best interests of the wife for him to accept instructions from her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	523	If he decides to accept instructions , his assumption of legal and professional responsibilities to her ought , in the ordinary course of things , to provide sufficient assurance that he will give the requisite advice fully , carefully and conscientiously . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	524	Especially so , now that the nature of the advice called for has been clarified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	525	If at any stage the solicitor becomes concerned that there is a real risk that other interests or duties may inhibit his advice to the wife he must cease to act for her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	526	Agency 75 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	527	No system ever works perfectly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	528	There will always be cases where things go wrong , sometimes seriously wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	529	The next question concerns the position when a solicitor has accepted instructions to advise a wife but he fails to do so properly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	530	He fails to give her the advice needed to bring home to her the practical implications of her standing as surety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	531	What then ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	532	The wife has a remedy in damages against the negligent solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	533	But what is the position of the bank who proceeded in the belief that the wife had been given the necessary advice ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	534	76 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	535	Mr Sher contended that , depending on the facts , the solicitor should be regarded as the agent of the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	536	Commonly , what happens is that the bank asks the solicitor acting for the husband to undertake the conveyancing formalities on behalf of the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	537	The bank also asks the solicitor to undertake the further task of explaining the nature and effect of the documents to the wife , and then confirming to the bank that he has done so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	538	In carrying out these requested tasks , it was submitted , the solicitor is acting for the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	539	The bank requires the solicitor to advise the wife , not for her benefit , but for the benefit and protection of the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	540	Any deficiencies in the advice given to the wife should be attributed to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	541	In this regard , it was submitted , the solicitor 's knowledge is to be imputed to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	542	A certificate furnished by the solicitor to the bank should not prejudice the position of the wife when , as happened in several cases , the contents of the certificate are untrue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	543	If the solicitor has not given the wife any advice , her rights should not be diminished by the solicitor telling the bank that she has been fully advised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	544	77 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	545	I can not accept this analysis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	546	Confirmation from the solicitor that he has advised the wife is one of the bank 's preconditions for completion of the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	547	But it is central to this arrangement that in advising the wife the solicitor is acting for the wife and no one else . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	548	The bank does not have , and is intended not to have , any knowledge of or control over the advice the solicitor gives the wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	549	The solicitor is not accountable to the bank for the advice he gives to the wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	550	To impute to the bank knowledge of what passed between the solicitor and the wife would contradict this essential feature of the arrangement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	551	The mere fact that , for its own purposes , the bank asked the solicitor to advise the wife does not make the solicitor the bank 's agent in giving that advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	552	78 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	553	In the ordinary case , therefore , deficiencies in the advice given are a matter between the wife and her solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	554	The bank is entitled to proceed on the assumption that a solicitor advising the wife has done his job properly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	555	I have already mentioned what is the bank 's position if it knows this is not so , or if it knows facts from which it ought to have realised this is not so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	556	Obtaining the solicitor 's confirmation 79 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	557	I now return to the steps a bank should take when it has been put on inquiry and for its protection is looking to the fact that the wife has been advised independently by a solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	558	-LRB- 1 -RRB- One of the unsatisfactory features in some of the cases is the late stage at which the wife first became involved in the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	559	In practice she had no opportunity to express a view on the identity of the solicitor who advised her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	560	She did not even know that the purpose for which the solicitor was giving her advice was to enable him to send , on her behalf , the protective confirmation sought by the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	561	Usually the solicitor acted for both husband and wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	562	Since the bank is looking for its protection to legal advice given to the wife by a solicitor who , in this respect , is acting solely for her , I consider the bank should take steps to check directly with the wife the name of the solicitor she wishes to act for her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	563	To this end , in future the bank should communicate directly with the wife , informing her that for its own protection it will require written confirmation from a solicitor , acting for her , to the effect that the solicitor has fully explained to her the nature of the documents and the practical implications they will have for her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	564	She should be told that the purpose of this requirement is that thereafter she should not be able to dispute she is legally bound by the documents once she has signed them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	565	She should be asked to nominate a solicitor whom she is willing to instruct to advise her , separately from her husband , and act for her in giving the necessary confirmation to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	566	She should be told that , if she wishes , the solicitor may be the same solicitor as is acting for her husband in the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	567	If a solicitor is already acting for the husband and the wife , she should be asked whether she would prefer that a different solicitor should act for her regarding the bank 's requirement for confirmation from a solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	568	The bank should not proceed with the transaction until it has received an appropriate response directly from the wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	569	-LRB- 2 -RRB- Representatives of the bank are likely to have a much better picture of the husband 's financial affairs than the solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	570	If the bank is not willing to undertake the task of explanation itself , the bank must provide the solicitor with the financial information he needs for this purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	571	Accordingly it should become routine practice for banks , if relying on confirmation from a solicitor for their protection , to send to the solicitor the necessary financial information . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	572	What is required must depend on the facts of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	573	Ordinarily this will include information on the purpose for which the proposed new facility has been requested , the current amount of the husband 's indebtedness , the amount of his current overdraft facility , and the amount and terms of any new facility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	574	If the bank 's request for security arose from a written application by the husband for a facility , a copy of the application should be sent to the solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	575	The bank will , of course , need first to obtain the consent of its customer to this circulation of confidential information . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	576	If this consent is not forthcoming the transaction will not be able to proceed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	577	-LRB- 3 -RRB- Exceptionally there may be a case where the bank believes or suspects that the wife has been misled by her husband or is not entering into the transaction of her own free will . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	578	If such a case occurs the bank must inform the wife 's solicitors of the facts giving rise to its belief or suspicion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	579	-LRB- 4 -RRB- The bank should in every case obtain from the wife 's solicitor a written confirmation to the effect mentioned above . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	580	80 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	581	These steps will be applicable to future transactions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	582	In respect of past transactions , the bank will ordinarily be regarded as having discharged its obligations if a solicitor who was acting for the wife in the transaction gave the bank confirmation to the effect that he had brought home to the wife the risks she was running by standing as surety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	583	The creditor 's disclosure obligation 81 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	584	It is a well-established principle that , stated shortly , a creditor is obliged to disclose to a guarantor any unusual feature of the contract between the creditor and the debtor which makes it materially different in a potentially disadvantageous respect from what the guarantor might naturally expect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	585	The precise ambit of this disclosure obligation remains unclear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	586	A useful summary of the authorities appears in O'Donovan and Phillips on the Modern Contract of Guarantee , 3rd ed -LRB- 1996 -RRB- , at pp 122-130 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	587	It is not necessary to pursue these difficult matters in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	588	It is sufficient for me to say that , contrary to submissions made , the need to provide protection for wives who are standing as sureties does not point to a need to re-visit the scope of this disclosure principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	589	Wives require a different form of protection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	590	They need a full and clear explanation of the risks involved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	591	Typically , the risks will be risks any surety would expect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	592	The protection needed by wives differs from , and goes beyond , the disclosure of information . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	593	The O'Brien principle is intended to provide this protection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	594	A wider principle 82 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	595	Before turning to the particular cases I must make a general comment on the O'Brien principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	596	As noted by Professor Peter Birks QC , the decision in O'Brien has to be seen as the progenitor of a wider principle : see ` The Burden on the Bank ' , in Restitution and Banking Law -LRB- ed Rose , 1998 -RRB- , at p 195 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	597	This calls for explanation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	598	In the O'Brien case the House was concerned with formulating a fair and practical solution to problems occurring when a creditor obtains a security from a guarantor whose sexual relationship with the debtor gives rise to a heightened risk of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	599	But the law does not regard sexual relationships as standing in some special category of their own so far as undue influence is concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	600	Sexual relationships are no more than one type of relationship in which an individual may acquire influence over another individual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	601	The O'Brien decision can not sensibly be regarded as confined to sexual relationships , although these are likely to be its main field of application at present . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	602	What is appropriate for sexual relationships ought , in principle , to be appropriate also for other relationships where trust and confidence are likely to exist . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	603	83 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	604	The courts have already recognised this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	605	Further application , or development , of the O'Brien principle has already taken place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	606	In Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland NV v Burch -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 1 All ER 144 the same principle was applied where the relationship was employer and employee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	607	Miss Burch was a junior employee in a company . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	608	She was neither a shareholder nor a director . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	609	She provided security to the bank for the company 's overdraft . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	610	She entered into a guarantee of unlimited amount , and gave the bank a second charge over her flat . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	611	Nourse LJ , at p 146 , said the relationship ` may broadly be said to fall under -LSB- O'Brien -RSB- ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	612	The Court of Appeal held that the bank was put on inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	613	It knew the facts from which the existence of a relationship of trust and confidence between Miss Burch and Mr Pelosi , the owner of the company , could be inferred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	614	84 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	615	The crucially important question raised by this wider application of the O'Brien principle concerns the circumstances which will put a bank on inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	616	A bank is put on inquiry whenever a wife stands as surety for her husband 's debts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	617	It is sufficient that the bank knows of the husband-wife relationship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	618	That bare fact is enough . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	619	The bank must then take reasonable steps to bring home to the wife the risks involved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	620	What , then , of other relationships where there is an increased risk of undue influence , such as parent and child ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	621	Is it enough that the bank knows of the relationship ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	622	For reasons already discussed in relation to husbands and wives , a bank can not be expected to probe the emotional relationship between two individuals , whoever they may be . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	623	Nor is it desirable that a bank should attempt this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	624	Take the case where a father puts forward his daughter as a surety for his business overdraft . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	625	A bank should not be called upon to evaluate highly personal matters such as the degree of trust and confidence existing between the father and his daughter , with the bank put on inquiry in one case and not in another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	626	As with wives , so with daughters , whether a bank is put on inquiry should not depend on the degree of trust and confidence the particular daughter places in her father in relation to financial matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
154	627	Moreover , as with wives , so with other relationships , the test of what puts a bank on inquiry should be simple , clear and easy to apply in widely varying circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	628	This suggests that , in the case of a father and daughter , knowledge by the bank of the relationship of father and daughter should suffice to put the bank on inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	629	When the bank knows of the relationship , it must then take reasonable steps to ensure the daughter knows what she is letting herself into . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	630	85 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	631	The relationship of parent and child is one of the relationships where the law irrebuttably presumes the existence of trust and confidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	632	Rightly , this has already been rejected as the boundary of the O'Brien principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	633	O'Brien was a husband-wife case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	634	The responsibilities of creditors were enunciated in a case where the law makes no presumption of the existence of trust and confidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	635	86 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	636	But the law can not stop at this point , with banks on inquiry only in cases where the debtor and guarantor have a sexual relationship or the relationship is one where the law presumes the existence of trust and confidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	637	That would be an arbitrary boundary , and the law has already moved beyond this , in the decision in Burch . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	638	As noted earlier , the reality of life is that relationships in which undue influence can be exercised are infinitely various . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	639	They can not be exhaustively defined . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	640	Nor is it possible to produce a comprehensive list of relationships where there is a substantial risk of the exercise of undue influence , all others being excluded from the ambit of the O'Brien principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	641	Human affairs do not lend themselves to categorisations of this sort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	642	The older generation of a family may exercise undue influence over a younger member , as in parent-child cases such as Bainbrigge v Browne , 18 Ch D 188 and Powell v Powell -LSB- 1900 -RSB- 1 Ch 243 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	643	Sometimes it is the other way round , as with a nephew and his elderly aunt in Inche Noriah v Shaik Allie Bin Omar -LSB- 1929 -RSB- AC 127 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	644	An employer may take advantage of his employee , as in Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland NV v Burch -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 1 All ER 144 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	645	But it may be the other way round , with an employee taking advantage of her employer , as happened with the secretary-companion and her elderly employer in In re Craig , Decd -LSB- 1971 -RSB- Ch 95 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	646	The list could go on . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	647	87 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	648	These considerations point forcibly to the conclusion that there is no rational cut-off point , with certain types of relationship being susceptible to the O'Brien principle and others not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	649	Further , if a bank is not to be required to evaluate the extent to which its customer has influence over a proposed guarantor , the only practical way forward is to regard banks as ` put on inquiry ' in every case where the relationship between the surety and the debtor is non-commercial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	650	The creditor must always take reasonable steps to bring home to the individual guarantor the risks he is running by standing as surety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	651	As a measure of protection , this is valuable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	652	But , in all conscience , it is a modest burden for banks and other lenders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	653	It is no more than is reasonably to be expected of a creditor who is taking a guarantee from an individual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	654	If the bank or other creditor does not take these steps , it is deemed to have notice of any claim the guarantor may have that the transaction was procured by undue influence or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	655	88 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	656	Different considerations apply where the relationship between the debtor and guarantor is commercial , as where a guarantor is being paid a fee , or a company is guaranteeing the debts of another company in the same group . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	657	Those engaged in business can be regarded as capable of looking after themselves and understanding the risks involved in the giving of guarantees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	658	89 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	659	By the decisions of this House in O'Brien and the Court of Appeal in Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland NV v Burch -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 1 All ER 144 , English law has taken its first strides in the development of some such general principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	660	It is a workable principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	661	It is also simple , coherent and eminently desirable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	662	I venture to think this is the way the law is moving , and should continue to move . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	663	Equity , it is said , is not past the age of child-bearing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	664	In the present context the equitable concept of being ` put on inquiry ' is the parent of a principle of general application , a principle which imposes no more than a modest obligation on banks and other creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	665	The existence of this obligation in all non-commercial cases does not go beyond the reasonable requirements of the present times . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	666	In future , banks and other creditors should regulate their affairs accordingly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	667	The particular cases 90 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	668	I have had the advantage of reading in draft a copy of the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Scott of Foscote . 	lord nicholls	lord scott	ackn	0.3	lord nicholls
154	669	He has summarised the facts in the eight appeals . 	lord nicholls	lord scott	factagr	0.3	lord nicholls
154	670	My views on the particular cases are as follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	671	-LRB- 1 -RRB- Midland Bank Plc v Wallace I would allow this appeal . 	lord nicholls	self	outcome	0.3	lord nicholls
154	672	The bank was put on inquiry , because this was a case of a wife standing as surety for her husband 's debts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	673	As the evidence stands at present , Mr Samson 's participation in the transaction does not assist the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	674	He was not Mrs Wallace 's solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	675	Deficiencies in the advice given by a solicitor do not normally concern the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	676	That is the position where the solicitor is acting for the wife , or where the solicitor has been held out by the wife to the bank as her solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	677	But where the solicitor was not acting for the wife , the bank is in the same position as any person who deals with another in the belief that the latter is acting on behalf of a third party principal when in truth he is not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	678	Leaving aside questions of ostensible authority or the like , the alleged principal is not bound or affected by the acts of such a stranger . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	679	The remedy of the bank lies against the -LRB- unauthorised -RRB- ` agent ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	680	If the bank has suffered provable loss , it has a claim for damages for breach of implied warranty of authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	681	This action should go to trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	682	-LRB- 2 -RRB- Barclays Bank Plc v Harris This is another interlocutory appeal , against an order striking out Mrs Harris ' defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	683	It is common ground that for striking out purposes Mrs Harris has an arguable case on undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	684	The bank was put on inquiry , because Mrs Harris was standing as surety for the debts of the company , S T Harris -LRB- Powder Coatings Consultant -RRB- Ltd. . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	685	I consider Mrs Harris has an arguable case that Wragge & Co never acted for her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	686	In this respect the case is similar to Wallace . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	687	This case should go to trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	688	-LRB- 3 -RRB- UCB Home Loans Corporation Ltd v Moore This is another interlocutory appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	689	For the reasons given by my noble and learned friend Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough , I would allow this appeal . 	lord nicholls	lord hobhouse	fullagr	0.3	lord nicholls
154	689	For the reasons given by my noble and learned friend Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough , I would allow this appeal . 	lord nicholls	self	outcome	0.3	lord nicholls

154	693	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	694	LORD CLYDE 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	695	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	696	91 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	697	I have had the opportunity of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and agree with it . 	lord clyde	lord nicholls	ackn	0.3	lord nicholls
154	697	I have had the opportunity of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and agree with it . 	lord clyde	lord nicholls	fullagr	0.3	lord nicholls
154	698	I add a few observations of my own because of the importance of the appeals which we have heard . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	699	92 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	700	I question the wisdom of the practice which has grown up , particularly since Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA v Aboody -LSB- 1990 -RSB- 1 QB 923 of attempting to make classifications of cases of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	701	That concept is in any event not easy to define . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	702	It was observed in Allcard v Skinner -LRB- 1887 -RRB- 36 Ch D 145 that `` no court has ever attempted to define undue influence '' -LRB- Lindley LJ , at p 183 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	703	It is something which can be more easily recognised when found than exhaustively analysed in the abstract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	704	Correspondingly the attempt to build up classes or categories may lead to confusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	705	The confusion is aggravated if the names used to identify the classes do not bear their actual meaning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	706	Thus on the face of it a division into cases of `` actual '' and `` presumed '' undue influence appears illogical . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	707	It appears to confuse definition and proof . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	708	There is also room for uncertainty whether the presumption is of the existence of an influence or of its quality as being undue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	709	I would also dispute the utility of the further sophistication of subdividing `` presumed undue influence '' into further categories . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	710	All these classifications to my mind add mystery rather than illumination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	711	93 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	712	There is a considerable variety in the particular methods by which undue influence may be brought to bear on the grantor of a deed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	713	They include cases of coercion , domination , victimisation and all the insidious techniques of persuasion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	714	Certainly it can be recognised that in the case of certain relationships it will be relatively easier to establish that undue influence has been at work than in other cases where that sinister conclusion is not necessarily to be drawn with such ease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	715	English law has identified certain relationships where the conclusion can prima facie be drawn so easily as to establish a presumption of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	716	But this is simply a matter of evidence and proof . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	717	In other cases the grantor of the deed will require to fortify the case by evidence , for example , of the pressure which was unfairly applied by the stronger party to the relationship , or the abuse of a trusting and confidential relationship resulting in for the one party a disadvantage and for the other a collateral benefit beyond what might be expected from the relationship of the parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	718	At the end of the day , after trial , there will either be proof of undue influence or that proof will fail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	719	and it will be found that there was no undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	720	In the former case , whatever the relationship of the parties and however the influence was exerted , there will be found to have been an actual case of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	721	In the latter there will be none . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	722	94 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	723	The second point relates to the steps which were suggested in Barclays Bank plc v O'Brien -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 180 as being appropriate for the lender to escape constructive notice of the wrongdoing in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	724	I agree that what was suggested in the case was not intended to be prescriptive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	725	So far as past cases were concerned it was said -LRB- Lord Browne-Wilkinson , at p 196 -RRB- that the creditor `` can reasonably be expected to take steps to bring home to the wife the risk she is running by standing as surety and to advise her to take independent advice '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	726	Those two courses of action were reflected in the Scottish case of Smith v Bank of Scotland 1997 SC -LRB- HL -RRB- 110 , 122 by the suggestion which I made in relation to the corresponding situation under Scots law that `` it would be sufficient for the creditor to warn the potential cautioner of the consequences of entering into the proposed cautionary obligation and to advise him or her to take independent advice '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	727	That statement echoed what was understood to be the existing practice recognised by banks and building societies and it seemed to me that steps of that kind ought to be enough to enable the creditor to counter any allegation of bad faith . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	728	But Lord Browne-Wilkinson proposed more stringent requirements for the avoidance of constructive notice in England for the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	729	These were that the creditor should insist `` that the wife attend a private meeting -LRB- in the absence of the husband -RRB- with a representative of the creditor at which she is told of the extent of her liability as surety , warned of the risk she is running and urged to take independent legal advice '' -LRB- see p 196 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	730	He also recognised , at p 197 , that there might be exceptional cases where undue influence was not simply possible but was probable and advised that in such cases the `` the creditor to be safe will have to insist that the wife is separately advised '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	731	95 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	732	One course is for the lender himself to warn the surety of the risk and to recommend the taking of legal advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	733	But there may well be good reasons , particularly for banks , to feel it inappropriate or even unwise for them to be giving any detailed form of warning or explanation , and to take the view that it is preferable for that matter to be managed by a solicitor acting for the wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	734	It is certainly possible to suggest courses of action which should be sufficient to absolve the creditor from constructive notice of any potential undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	735	Thus in the summary at the end of his speech Lord Browne-Wilkinson said , at p 199 : `` unless there are special exceptional circumstances , a creditor will have taken such reasonable steps to avoid being fixed with constructive notice if the creditor warns the surety -LRB- at a meeting not attended by the principal debtor -RRB- of the amount of her potential liability and of the risks involved and advises the surety to take independent legal advice . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	736	But matters of banking practice are principally matters for the banks themselves in light of the rights and liabilities which the law may impose upon them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	737	I would not wish to prescribe what those practices should be . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	738	One can only suggest some courses of action which should meet the requirements of the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	739	These are not matters of ritual , the blind performance of which will secure the avoidance of doom , but sensible steps which seek to secure that the personal and commercial interests of the parties involved are secured with certainty and fairness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	740	Necessarily the precise course to be adopted will depend upon the circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	741	In the Scottish case of Forsyth v Royal Bank of Scotland Plc 2000 SLT 1295 it appeared to the creditor that the wife had already had the benefit of professional legal advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	742	In such a case , it may well be that no further steps need be taken by the creditor to safeguard his rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	743	Of course if the creditor knows or ought to know from the information available to him that the wife has not in fact received the appropriate advice then the transaction may be open to challenge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	744	96 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	745	Thirdly , I agree that it is not fatal that the solicitor is also the solicitor who acts for the party for whose benefit the guarantee or the charge is being effected , that is to say the husband in cases where the wife is granting the deed in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	746	If there is any question of any conflict of interest arising , or if the solicitor feels that he can not properly act for the wife in the matter of giving the advice , then he will be perfectly able to identify the difficulty and withdraw . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	747	Again it should be stressed that the wife 's consultation with her solicitor is a serious step which is not to be brushed off as a mere formality or a charade . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	748	It is in the interests of all the parties involved that the wife should appreciate the significance of what she has been asked to sign so that the transaction may not only appear to be fair but also in fact to be freely and voluntarily undertaken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	749	97 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	750	I agree that the appeals in the cases of Mrs Wallace , Mrs Bennett , Mrs Moore and Desmond Banks & Co be allowed . 	lord clyde	self	outcome	0.3	lord nicholls
154	751	I have had some hesitation about the case of Mrs Harris but following in particular the view expressed by Lord Scott of Foscote I consider that the appeal in her case should also be allowed . 	lord clyde	lord scott	partagr	0.3	lord nicholls
154	751	I have had some hesitation about the case of Mrs Harris but following in particular the view expressed by Lord Scott of Foscote I consider that the appeal in her case should also be allowed . 	lord clyde	self	outcome	0.3	lord nicholls
154	752	I consider that the other appeals should be dismissed . 	lord clyde	self	outcome	0.3	lord nicholls
154	753	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	754	LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	755	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	756	Introduction : 98 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	757	These appeals have come before your Lordships in order to enable the workings of the judgments of your Lordships ' House in Barclays Bank Plc v O'Brien -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 180 and CIBC Mortgages Plc v Pitt -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 200 to be considered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	758	The leading speech in both of those cases was , with the agreement of the House , that of Lord Browne-Wilkinson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	759	His speeches are in my respectful opinion a masterly exposition of principles designed to give structure to this difficult corner of the law and to provide practical solutions to the problems to which it gives rise whilst recognising the conflict between the interests of the commercial community and the need to protect vulnerable members of society from oppression or exploitation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	760	These problems and conflicts are real and should not be ignored . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	761	The value of the transactions takes them outside the scope of the existing statutory protection and the solution therefore has to be found in the application of equitable principles formulated by judges . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	762	Experience in litigation since 1993 has not been encouraging . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	763	Disputes have continued to come before the courts ; the determination of those disputes has not always carried conviction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	764	Before your Lordships no party has sought to challenge the authority of Lord Browne-Wilkinson 's speeches , subject to the criticism of one point of categorisation derived from BCCI v Aboody -LSB- 1990 -RSB- 1 QB 923 , criticism which I , like the rest of your Lordships , consider to be justified ; the point of categorisation has been the source of much of the confusion which has ensued . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	765	99 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	766	I therefore propose to take the speech of Lord Browne-Wilkinson in O'Brien as my starting point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	767	Some of what he said was novel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	768	Some has been criticised as departing from fully conventional equitable principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	769	It is true that other approaches had been adopted in other cases , including in the Court of Appeal in that case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	770	But the purpose of such judgments of this House is to settle the law and enable certainty to be re-established . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	771	That should again be the objective of your Lordships on these appeals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	772	Doubt should not be cast upon the authority of O'Brien . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	773	There is a need for some clarification and for the problem areas to be resolved as far as possible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	774	But the essential structure of O'Brien is in my view sound and Lord Browne-Wilkinson fully took into account the practical implications . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	775	100 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	776	To the end that lenders , those advising parties and , indeed , judges should have clear statements of the law on which to base themselves , I will state at the outset that in this speech I shall agree with my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls and , specifically , the guidance which he gives concerning the role of the burden of proof , the duties of solicitors towards their clients -LRB- paragraphs 64-68 , and paragraph 74 -RRB- , and the steps which a lender which has been put on enquiry should take paragraph 79 -RRB- . 	lord hobhouse	lord nicholls	fullagr	0.3	lord nicholls
154	777	I would stress that this guidance should not be treated as optional , to be watered down when it proves inconvenient -LRB- as may be thought to have been the fate of Lord Browne-Wilkinson 's equally carefully crafted scheme -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	778	Nor should it be regarded as something which will only apply to future transactions ; it has represented , and continues to represent , the reasonable response to being put on enquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	779	The purpose of guidance is to provide certainty for those who rely upon and conform to the requirements of that guidance : it is not a licence to excuse unreasonable conduct on the ground that no judge had previously told them in express terms what was not an adequate response . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	780	If the relevant solicitor was not in fact acting for the wife and had not been held out by the wife as doing so , the conduct of that solicitor will not avail the lender . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	781	Once a lender has been put on enquiry , mere assumptions on the part of the lender will not assist him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	782	I will , in the course of this speech and without qualifying the scope of my agreement with Lord Nicholls , mention certain points in the hope that it will add to the clarity and accuracy of the analysis . 	lord hobhouse	lord nicholls	fullagr	0.3	lord nicholls
154	783	I must also express my gratitude to my noble and learned friend Lord Scott of Foscote , whose speech I have read in draft , for his summary of the facts of the eight individual cases before the House . 	lord hobhouse	lord scott	ackn	0.3	lord nicholls
154	783	I must also express my gratitude to my noble and learned friend Lord Scott of Foscote , whose speech I have read in draft , for his summary of the facts of the eight individual cases before the House . 	lord hobhouse	lord scott	factagr	0.3	lord nicholls
154	784	O'Brien : 101 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	785	The speech of Lord Browne-Wilkinson followed a four part scheme . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	786	First , he characterised the law of the enforceability of suretyship contracts and security as between lenders to a husband or his company and a wife as being an application of the equitable principle of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	787	Secondly , he sought to categorise the undue influence into classes drawn from Allcard v Skinner -LRB- 1887 -RRB- 36 Ch D 145 , Turnbull & Co v Duval -LSB- 1902 -RSB- AC 429 and BCCI v Aboody -LRB- v.s. -RRB- giving rise to presumptions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	788	Thirdly , he provided a formulation to answer the question whether the lender had been put on enquiry as to the risk of undue influence : `` a creditor is put on inquiry when a wife offers to stand surety for her husband 's debts by the combination of two factors : -LRB- a -RRB- the transaction is on its face not to the financial advantage of the wife ; and -LRB- b -RRB- there is a substantial risk in transactions of that kind that , in procuring the wife to act as surety , the husband has committed a legal or equitable wrong that entitles the wife to set aside the transaction . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	789	-LRB- p. 196 -RRB- Fourthly , he laid down steps which if taken would enable the lender to say that he had taken reasonable steps to satisfy himself that the `` surety entered into the obligation freely and in knowledge of the true fact '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	790	-LRB- p. 198 -RRB- His speech thus provides a structured scheme for the decision of cases raising the issue of enforceability as between a lender and a wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	791	It can be expressed by answering 3 questions : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Has the wife proved what is necessary for the court to be satisfied that the transaction was affected by the undue influence of the husband ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	792	-LRB- 2 -RRB- Was the lender put on enquiry ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	793	-LRB- 3 -RRB- If so , did the lender take reasonable steps to satisfy itself that there was no undue influence ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	794	It will be appreciated that unless the first question is answered in favour of the wife neither of the later questions arise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	795	The wife has no defence and is liable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	796	It will likewise be appreciated that the second and third questions arise from the fact that the wife is seeking to use the undue influence of her husband as a defence against the lender and therefore has to show that the lender should be affected by the equity - that it is unconscionable that the lender should enforce the secured contractual right against her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	797	102 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	798	Difficulties have arisen in relation to each of these three questions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	799	I will take the questions in turn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	800	The most important difficulties relate to the first and third questions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	801	-LRB- 1 -RRB- Presumed Undue Influence : 103 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	802	The division between presumed and actual undue influence derives from the judgments in Allcard v Skinner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	803	Actual undue influence presents no relevant problem . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	804	It is an equitable wrong committed by the dominant party against the other which makes it unconscionable for the dominant party to enforce his legal rights against the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	805	It is typically some express conduct overbearing the other party 's will . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	806	It is capable of including conduct which might give a defence at law , for example , duress and misrepresentation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	807	Indeed many of the cases relating to wives who have given guarantees and charges for their husband 's debts involve allegations of misrepresentation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	808	-LRB- O'Brien was such a case . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	809	Actual undue influence does not depend upon some preexisting relationship between the two parties though it is most commonly associated with and derives from such a relationship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	810	He who alleges actual undue influence must prove it 104 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	811	Presumed undue influence is different in that it necessarily involves some legally recognised relationship between the two parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	812	As a result of that relationship one party is treated as owing a special duty to deal fairly with the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	813	It is not necessary for present purposes to define the limits of the relationships which give rise to this duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	814	Typically they are fiduciary or closely analogous relationships . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	815	A solicitor owes a legal duty to deal fairly with his client and he must , if challenged , be prepared to show that he has done so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	816	In Pitt at p. 209 , Lord Browne-Wilkinson referred to `` the long standing principle laid down in the abuse of confidence cases viz the law requires those in a fiduciary position who enter into transactions with those to whom they owe fiduciary duties to establish affirmatively that the transaction was a fair one . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	817	Such legal relationships can be described as relationships where one party is legally presumed to repose trust and confidence in the other - the other side of the coin to the duty not to abuse that confidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	818	But there is no presumption properly so called that the confidence has been abused . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	819	It is a matter of evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	820	If all that has happened is that , say , a client has left a small bequest to his family solicitor or that a solicitor has made a reasonable charge for professional services rendered to the client , no inference of abuse or unfair dealing will arise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	821	But if a solicitor has bought property from his client and it is properly put in issue that the purchase was at an under-value or that the client 's consent may have been improperly obtained , the solicitor will have to show that the price was fair and that the client 's consent to the transaction was freely given in knowledge of the true facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	822	The solicitor has to justify what he has done . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	823	He has a burden of proof to discharge and if he fails to discharge it he will not have succeeded in justifying his conduct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	824	Thus , at the trial the judge will decide on the evidence whether he is in fact satisfied that there was no abuse of confidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	825	It will be appreciated that the relevance of the concept of `` manifest disadvantage '' is evidential . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	826	It is relevant to the question whether there is any issue of abuse which can properly be raised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	827	It is relevant to the determination whether in fact abuse did or did not occur . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	828	It is a fallacy to argue from the terminology normally used , `` presumed undue influence '' , to the position , not of presuming that one party reposed trust and confidence in the other , but of presuming that an abuse of that relationship has occurred ; factual inference , yes , once the issue has been properly raised , but not a presumption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	829	105 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	830	The Court of Appeal in Aboody and Lord Browne-Wilkinson classified cases where there was a legal relationship between the parties which the law presumed to be one of trust and confidence as `` presumed undue influence : class 2 -LRB- A -RRB- '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	831	They then made the logical extrapolation that there should be a class 2 -LRB- B -RRB- to cover those cases where it was proved by evidence that one party had in fact reposed trust and confidence in the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	832	It was then said that the same consequences flowed from this factual relationship as from the legal class 2 -LRB- A -RRB- relationship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	833	Lord Browne-Wilkinson said at pp.189-190 `` In a Class 2 -LRB- B -RRB- case therefore , in the absence of evidence disproving undue influence , the complainant will succeed in setting aside the impugned transaction merely by proof that the complainant reposed trust and confidence in the wrongdoer without having to prove that the wrongdoer exerted actual undue influence or otherwise abused such trust and confidence in relation to the particular transaction impugned . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	834	There are difficulties in the literal application of this statement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	835	It describes the other party as a `` wrongdoer '' without saying why when it is expressly postulated that no wrongdoing may have occurred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	836	He treats trust and confidence as indivisible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	837	His actual words are : `` a relationship under which the complainant generally reposed trust and confidence in the wrongdoer '' -LRB- emphasis supplied -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	838	But a wife may be happy to trust her husband to make the right decision in relation to some matters but not others ; she may leave a particular decision to him but not other decisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	839	Nor is it clear why the mere `` existence of such relationship raises the presumption of undue influence '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	840	Where the relevant question is one of fact and degree and of the evaluation of evidence , the language of presumption is likely to confuse rather than assist and this is borne out by experience . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	841	106 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	842	That there is room for an analogous approach to cases concerning a wife 's guarantee of her husband 's debts is clear and no doubt led to Lord Browne-Wilkinson saying what he did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	843	The guarantee is given by the wife at the request of the husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	844	The guarantee is not on its face advantageous to the wife , doubly so where her liability is secured upon her home . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	845	The wife may well have trusted the husband to take for her the decision whether she should give the guarantee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	846	If he takes the decision in these circumstances , he owes her a duty to have regard to her interests before deciding . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	847	He is under a duty to deal fairly with her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	848	He should make sure that she is entering into the obligation freely and in knowledge of the true facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	849	His duty may thus be analogous to that of a class 2 -LRB- A -RRB- fiduciary so that it would be appropriate to require him to justify the decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	850	If no adequate justification is then provided , the conclusion would be that there had been an abuse of confidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	851	But any conclusion will only be reached after having received evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	852	This evidence will inevitably cover as well whether there has in fact been an abuse of confidence or any other undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	853	The judge may have to draw inferences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	854	He may have to decide whether he accepts the evidence of the wife and , if so , what it really amounts to , particularly if it is uncontradicted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	855	Since there is no legal relationship of trust and confidence , the general burden of proving some form of wrongdoing remains with the wife , but the evidence which she has adduced may suffice to raise an inference of wrongdoing which the opposite party may find itself having to adduce evidence to rebut . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	856	If at the end of the trial the wife succeeds on the issue of undue influence , it will be because that is the right conclusion of fact on the state of the evidence at the end of the trial , not because of some artificial legal presumption that there must have been undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	857	107 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	858	In agreement with what I understand to be the view of your Lordships , I consider that the so-called class 2 -LRB- B -RRB- presumption should not be adopted . 	lord hobhouse	all	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	859	It is not a useful forensic tool . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	860	The wife or other person alleging that the relevant agreement or charge is not enforceable must prove her case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	861	She can do this by proving that she was the victim of an equitable wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	862	This wrong may be an overt wrong , such as oppression ; or it may be the failure to perform an equitable duty , such as a failure by one in whom trust and confidence is reposed not to abuse that trust by failing to deal fairly with her and have proper regard to her interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	863	Although the general burden of proof is , and remains , upon her , she can discharge that burden of proof by establishing a sufficient prima facie case to justify a decision in her favour on the balance of probabilities , the court drawing appropriate inferences from the primary facts proved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	864	Evidentially the opposite party will then be faced with the necessity to adduce evidence sufficient to displace that conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	865	Provided it is remembered that the burden is an evidential one , the comparison with the operation of the doctrine res ipsa loquitur is useful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	866	-LRB- 2 -RRB- Put on Enquiry : 108 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	867	However described , this is an essential step in the reasoning of Lord Browne-Wilkinson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	868	The wife becomes involved at the request of her husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	869	It is he who , in these types of case , is the source of the undue influence and commits the equitable wrong against her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	870	But the party with whom the wife contracts and to whom the wife accepts obligations is the lender . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	871	It is the lender who is seeking to enforce those obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	872	Therefore there has to be some additional factor before the lender 's conscience is affected and he is to be restrained from enforcing his legal rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	873	The solution adopted by Lord Browne-Wilkinson was to formulate a principle of constructive notice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	874	He did so in terms which were not as restrictive as the established principles of constructive knowledge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	875	However , there is a structural difficulty in his approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	876	Notice of the risk of undue influence is not an all or nothing question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	877	Situations will differ across a spectrum from a very small risk to a serious risk verging on a probability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
154	878	There has to be a proportionality between the degree of risk and the requisite response to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	879	Lord Browne-Wilkinson expressed it in terms of a `` substantial risk '' -LRB- p. 196 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	880	But , then , in describing the requisite response he stated -LRB- p. 197 -RRB- that he had been considering `` the ordinary case where the creditor knows only that the wife is to stand surety for her husband 's debts '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	881	This is , as my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls has said , a low threshold . 	lord hobhouse	lord nicholls	partagr	0.4	lord nicholls
154	882	There are arguments which would favour a higher threshold . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	883	It would enable a more positive approach to be taken to the response . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	884	It would avoid calling for a response when the level of risk did not really justify it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	885	But the advantage of this low threshold is that it assists banks to put in place procedures which do not require an exercise of judgment by their officials and I accept Lord Nicholls 's affirmation of the low threshold . 	lord hobhouse	lord nicholls	partagr	0.4	lord nicholls
154	886	This , however , is not to say that banks are at liberty to close their eyes to evidence of higher levels of risk or fail to respond appropriately to higher risks of which they have notice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	887	109 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	888	Needless to say the question whether the bank has been put on enquiry has to be answered upon the basis of the facts available to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	889	Does the bank know that the wife is standing surety for her husband 's debts ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	890	This should be an easy question for the bank to answer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	891	The bank should know who the principal debtor is and what is the purpose of the facility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	892	Likewise the bank should know of any factors which are likely to aggravate the risk of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	893	Paradoxically the best place at which to start to assess the risk of undue influence is to consider the true nature of the transaction and examine the financial position of the principal debtor and the proposal which he is making to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	894	These are the facts which the bank has most readily to hand and , if it finds that it lacks relevant information , it is in a position to get it and has the expertise to assess it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	895	A loan application backed by a viable business plan or to acquire a worthwhile asset is very different from a loan to postpone the collapse of an already failing business or to refinance with additional security loans which have fallen into arrear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	896	The former would not aggravate the risk ; the latter most certainly would do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	897	The bank is as well placed as anyone to assess the underlying rationality of the debtor 's proposal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	898	It will be the bank that will have formed the view that it is not satisfied with the debtor 's covenant and the security he can provide and it will be the bank that has called for additional security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	899	The bank will also probably be aware what has been the previous involvement , if any , of the wife in the husband 's business affairs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	900	110 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	901	The position therefore is that in relation to any guarantee by a wife of her husband 's debts -LRB- or those of his company -RRB- the bank is put on enquiry and accordingly will have to respond unless it is to run the risk of finding that the guarantee and other security provided by the wife are unenforceable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	902	If it becomes aware of any aggravation of the risk of undue influence , its response must take that into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	903	More will be required to satisfy it that the wife 's agreement has been properly obtained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	904	The Practical Situation : 111 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	905	Before turning to discuss what are the reasonable steps to be taken by a lender who had been put on enquiry , I will pause to look at some of the practical aspects . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	906	Lord Browne-Wilkinson clearly regarded these as important -LRB- pp.197-8 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	907	He drew attention to the Report of the Review Committee on Banking Services under the chairmanship of Professor Jack which reported in 1989 -LRB- Cm .622 -RRB- which noted that `` there are cases of guarantors losing their houses because of open ended commitments that they entered into , without understanding or advice '' -LRB- ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	908	13.22 -RRB- and recommended that banks should adopt a standard of best practice which would require them to `` ensure that prospective guarantors , whether or not they are customers , are adequately warned about the legal effects and possible consequences of guarantees , and about the importance of receiving independent advice '' -LRB- recommendation 13.5 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	909	The Committee was concerned with the lack of the understanding on the part of guarantors of the onerous contractual obligations arising from the signature of the forms used by banks for guarantees or charges . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	910	The printed documentation used by banks is of such length , complexity and obscurity that it is unlikely to be read let alone understood by private guarantors who lack legal training or appropriate business experience . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	911	They are treated by banks as contracts of adhesion discouraging any attempt to modify any of their terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	912	They are often unduly favourable to the bank and excessively onerous to the surety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	913	The surety will probably be made a principal debtor and liable without limit for very onerous rates of interest and charges . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	914	The liability may be an `` all moneys '' guarantee covering without limit any future advances not merely the advances intended to be guaranteed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	915	Thus , quite apart from the question of undue influence , the signature of such documents may not represent any reality of informed consent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	916	The need to guard against lack of comprehension is important and applies in any event to a non-business surety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	917	But it is not the same as guarding against undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	918	It may be a first step but it is a fallacy to confuse the two . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	919	Comprehension is essential for any legal documents of this complexity and obscurity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	920	But for the purpose of negativing undue influence it is necessary to be satisfied that the agreement was , also , given freely in knowledge of the true facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	921	It must be remembered that the equitable doctrine of undue influence has been created for the protection of those who are sui juris and competent to undertake legal obligations but are nevertheless vulnerable and liable to have their will unduly influenced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	922	It is their weakness which is being protected not their inability to comprehend . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	923	I regret that I must specifically disagree with my noble and learned friend Lord Scott when -LRB- in his summary -RRB- he treats a belief on the part of a lender that the wife has understood the nature and effect of the transaction as sufficient to exonerate the lender from enquiry or as treating this as the effect of the scheme laid out by Lord Nicholls in the paragraphs to which I have referred earlier . 	lord hobhouse	lord scott	fulldisa	0.4	lord nicholls

154	924	112 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	925	A further point of relevance which has been commented on in the past and should be commented upon again has been the use by banks of forms under which the surety gives an unlimited guarantee or charge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	926	This was what banks ordinarily asked for . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	927	Indeed , the guarantees obtained in the cases from which these appeals arise , are unlimited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	928	Banks have acknowledged that such guarantees are likely to be unnecessary and unjustifiable where private sureties are sought . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	929	They should be subject to a stated monetary limit on the surety 's liability and any legal adviser should so advise a private client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	930	Where a bank has nevertheless obtained an unlimited guarantee from a wife , it should ask itself how that can be if the wife has in truth been independently advised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	931	Would anyone who had a proper regard to the wife 's interests ask her to sign an unlimited guarantee or charge ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	932	113 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	933	Lord Browne-Wilkinson stressed the need for the wife to be seen and communicated with separately from her husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	934	This was clearly appropriate since , if the purpose is to satisfy oneself that the wife is acting freely in knowledge of the true facts , an interview in the presence of the husband is unlikely to achieve this objective if she has been improperly influenced by him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	935	Lord Browne-Wilkinson concluded that the requirement of a personal interview did not impose such an additional administrative burden as to make the bank 's position unworkable -LRB- p. 198 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	936	What the banks appear to find difficult is entrusting the conduct of such an interview to one of their own officers as opposed to entrusting it to an outside agent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	937	This is sad but probably derives from a wish to avoid getting directly involved in imparting information and maybe opinions to an individual whose interests are likely to conflict with their own and with whom they may subsequently be in dispute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	938	Lord Browne-Wilkinson contemplated that the banks might use a representative to do what he considered necessary and this would imply that they would be responsible for their representative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	939	The banks have not done this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	940	They have used solicitors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	941	They have denied any responsibility even for a complete failure of the solicitor whom they have instructed to carry out their instructions and have nevertheless sought to hold the wife to her signature so obtained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	942	I doubt that this is what Lord Browne-Wilkinson had in mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	943	114 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	944	The use of solicitors has given rise to further practical -LRB- and , to a limited extent , legal -RRB- problems . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	945	The first is ensuring that the solicitor is in possession of the relevant facts as known to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	946	The advantage of an officer of the bank conducting the interview with the wife is that he has the file and access to the relevant facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	947	The solicitor on the other hand may have nothing except the documents which are to be signed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	948	It is within the control of the bank what it sends to the solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	949	If the solicitor is to conduct the interview with the wife , the bank must give him the information . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	950	The next difficulty is that the bank 's information about the affairs of its customer is confidential and the bank may need to obtain the husband 's consent to give this information to the solicitor and the wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	951	However , if the husband refuses to give his consent , this would be a clear indication to the bank and the solicitor that something may be amiss and that it ought not to rely upon the wife being bound . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	952	A further point is that contracts of suretyship are not contracts of the utmost good faith . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	953	There is no general duty of disclosure : see the authorities cited by my noble and learned friends in their speeches , to which I would add the speech of Lord Clyde in Smith v Bank of Scotland 1997 SLT 1061 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	954	Seeing that the solicitor is adequately informed is not the performance of a duty owed by the bank to the wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	955	It is simply a necessary step to be taken by the bank so that it may be satisfied that the wife entered into the obligation freely and in knowledge of the true facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	956	115 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	957	Another consequence of using solicitors is the risk of confusion about what the solicitor 's role is to be . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	958	The solicitor will normally have been instructed by the bank to act for it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	959	The solicitor will often already be acting for the husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	960	The solicitor may not be acting for the wife at all , let alone separately and independently from the solicitor 's other clients . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	961	Similarly , the solicitor 's instructions may simply be to explain to the signatories the character and legal effect of the documents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	962	This is a low order of advice which can be given solely by reference to the formal documents to be signed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	963	It is also important to appreciate that the solicitor 's role may simply be to witness a signature . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	964	Such a role involves no necessary relationship whatsoever between the solicitor and the signatory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	965	Indeed they may have or represent conflicting interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	966	The solicitor may simply have been instructed by one party to see and be prepared to provide evidence that the relevant document was signed and delivered by the other party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	967	Seeing that a solicitor has witnessed a signature itself means nothing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	968	Even when a solicitor is instructed to explain the character and legal effect of a document , he will not without more concern himself at all with the interests of the wife or whether she is accepting the obligations freely and with knowledge of the true facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	969	Under these circumstances it is scarcely surprising , as the facts of these cases and many others show , that wives are still signing documents as a result of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	970	The involvement of a solicitor has too often been a formality or merely served to reinforce the husband 's wishes and undermine any scope for the wife to exercise an independent judgment whether to comply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	971	Lord Browne-Wilkinson observed at -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC p. 188 , `` The number of recent cases in this field shows that in practice many wives are still subjected to , and yield to , undue influence by their husbands . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	972	Such wives can reasonably look to the law for some protection when their husbands have abused the trust and confidence reposed in them . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	973	The result of the practice of relying upon solicitors ' certificates has been described by Sir Peter Millett -LRB- as he then was -RRB- in his lecture to the Chancery Bar Association -LRB- 114 LQR 214 at p. 220 -RRB- , referring to an article by Sir Anthony Mason -LRB- 110 LQR 238 -RRB- , `` What Sir Anthony Mason has described as ` ritual reliance on the provision of legal advice ' is foreign to the traditional approach of a court of equity and is manifestly failing to give adequate protection to the wife or cohabitant who acts as surety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	974	We have substituted an inappropriate bright line rule for a proper investigation of the facts and have failed the vulnerable in the process . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	975	The Australians are turning to the jurisdiction to relieve against harsh and unconscionable bargains as an alternative , and there is much merit in this approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	976	It is certainly better than allowing the bank to assume that the surety has received adequate legal advice , an assumption which the bank almost always knows to be false . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	977	The crux of this situation is that the bank requests the solicitor to give a certificate which the bank then treats as conclusive evidence that it has no notice of any undue influence which has occurred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	978	But the wife may have no knowledge that this certificate is to be given and will not have authorised the solicitor to give it and , what is more , the solicitor will deny that he is under any obligation to the wife -LRB- or the bank -RRB- to satisfy himself that the wife is entering into the obligations freely and in knowledge of the true facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	979	The law has , in order to accommodate the commercial lenders , adopted a fiction which nullifies the equitable principle and deprives vulnerable members of the public of the protection which equity gives them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	980	116 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	981	Lord Browne-Wilkinson contemplated a two stage exercise , the first stage being an interview between the lender and the wife -LRB- for which the lender would be responsible -RRB- and the second being the wife taking independent advice from a solicitor -LRB- for which the lender would not be responsible -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	982	The practice of banks has been to run these two stages together thus creating confusion about the role of the solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	983	I accept that the best solution is that adopted by Lord Nicholls in his speech . 	lord hobhouse	lord nicholls	partagr	0.4	lord nicholls
154	984	The solicitor in communicating with and advising the wife should be doing so solely as her solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	985	The solicitor 's certificate which the bank asks for is something which the bank is asking the wife to procure and which the solicitor is providing as her solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	986	I am satisfied that , provided that the guidance which Lord Nicholls gives -LRB- in the paragraphs which I have identified at the outset of this speech -RRB- is complied with , the wife will have a reasonable chance of receiving the protection she may need . 	lord hobhouse	lord nicholls	partagr	0.4	lord nicholls
154	987	But it will be appreciated that an essential feature of the scheme is that the wife has to be aware of what is going on , that the bank is asking for the certificate and why , that she is being asked to instruct a solicitor to advise her and that she is being asked to authorise the solicitor to provide the certificate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	988	This is a far cry from the situation which has been tolerated in the past where the wife has not appreciated that she had any solicitor or was being advised and did not know of the existence of the certificate or its significance ; indeed it has been that type of situation which has given rise to the most scandalous cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	989	117 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	990	Illuminating evidence was given at the trial of the Gill action relevant to what was practical from the bank 's point of view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	991	The bank there was the National Westminster Bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	992	The bank manager gave evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	993	In answer to direct questions he accepted without qualification that he foresaw the potential for undue influence by a husband where his wife is being asked to stand surety for the debts of her husband 's business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	994	His solution was to procure that the wife received separate legal advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	995	In saying this he was following the practice of his bank as set out in a document -LRB- which he produced during his evidence in chief -RRB- with which he said he was already familiar in December 1988 -LRB- that is to say well before O'Brien in the House of Lords -RRB- headed `` Charged Security - Separate Legal Advice - Action Sheet '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	996	It includes the following passages - `` The security may be voidable if undue influence can be established . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	997	Therefore , great care is needed when there is any likelihood that a potential guarantor or third-party chargor may be unduly influenced by a borrower . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	998	Undue influence may exist where there is a special relationship between the parties , eg : husband and wife ... Do not regard the above list as exhaustive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	999	The background always requires careful thought ... ... where the guarantor/chargor is a customer of the Bank ... - the Bank has a duty , where any doubts exist , to INSIST that independent legal advice is given regarding : -LRB- a -RRB- the nature of the guarantee/charge , -LRB- b -RRB- the viability of the underlying proposition - advise the guarantor/chargor to obtain full details from the principal debtor , whose consent is required before disclosures , as to the underlying transaction , can be made to the grantor/chargor or legal advisor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1000	Always consider , in detail , the circumstances surrounding a transaction , as undue influence may arise where direct security is taken for joint borrowing , eg -LRB- i -RRB- joint borrowing for purposes ostensibly in the interest of only one of the borrowers ... Where there is any suspicion of undue influence , the Manager must ensure that all guarantors/third-party chargors take separate legal advice from a firm of solicitors nominated by the guarantor/chargor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1001	Send the charge form directly to the solicitor concerned ... - To avoid a conflict of interest , ensure that the witnessing solicitor is not also acting for the borrower . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1002	In such circumstances another solicitor , who may be a partner in the same firm , must be used . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1003	-LRB- emphasis as in the original -RRB- 118 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1004	My Lords I have quoted from this document because it discloses the response of a major high street bank to the question of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1005	It does not seek to play down the risk . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1006	It puts husbands and wives at the top of the list . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1007	It requires that independent/separate legal advice be taken by the guarantor/chargor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1008	It stresses the importance of having regard to the viability of the underlying proposition or transaction and where necessary obtaining full details from the principal debtor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1009	It requires that the solicitor be the solicitor nominated by the guarantor/chargor and that the actual solicitor must not be acting for the borrower as well . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1010	These points are all of practical as well as legal importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1011	Banks were prepared to accommodate them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1012	They did not need to be told that they had to by Lord Browne-Wilkinson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1013	It represented a pragmatic response to the practical as well as the legal questions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1014	In some respects , the National Westminster Bank `` action sheet '' goes quite a bit further than what is required by Lord Nicholls . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1015	It shows that the speech of Lord Nicholls does not require banks to go further than they had already been prepared to go before O'Brien and that what Lord Nicholls requires is and was in fact reasonable and practical . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1016	-LRB- 3 -RRB- Reasonable Steps : 119 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1017	Lord Browne-Wilkinson favoured a personal interview with the wife conducted in the absence of the husband by a representative of the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1018	The wife would then be urged to take independent/separate legal advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1019	It followed that the bank would be responsible for the first of these steps but not the second . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1020	The banks were not following this course . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1021	They were not doing anything themselves . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1022	They were instructing a solicitor , asking him to supply a formal certificate limited to comprehension and that is all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1023	This is what had given rise to the fiction of free and informed consent where none existed and no steps had been taken to discover the true position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1024	120 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1025	Given the state of the authorities since the speeches in O'Brien and Pitt were delivered and the need to provide fresh guidance , I agree that your Lordships should adopt the scheme spelled out by Lord Nicholls . 	lord hobhouse	lord nicholls	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1026	The central feature is that the wife will be put into a proper relationship with a solicitor who is acting for her and accepts appropriate duties towards her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1027	Likewise the bank or other lender must communicate directly with the wife to the end that that relationship is established and that any certificate upon which it may seek to rely is the fruit of such a professional relationship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1028	121 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1029	If the bank follows this procedure then the fiction of independent advice and consent should be replaced by true independent advice and real consent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1030	It will probably be less onerous for the lender than what was required by Lord Browne-Wilkinson and the National Westminster `` action sheet '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1031	It will also be observed that it is consistent with the duty of the solicitor towards his client , the wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1032	He will appreciate that he can not give the statement and certificate unless it conforms to the reality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1033	Similarly , the wife will not be left in ignorance of what has been going on and will know what she is entitled to get from the solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1034	122 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1035	It also resolves the question of what knowledge of the solicitor will affect the bank either under the common law or under s. 199 of the Law of Property Act 1925 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1036	The solicitor in question will not be acting for the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1037	Any knowledge the solicitor acquires from the wife will be confidential as between the two of them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1038	If it renders untruthful the statement or certificate , the solicitor can not sign them without being in breach of his professional obligation to the wife and committing a fraud on the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1039	The wife 's remedy will be against the solicitor and not against the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1040	If the solicitor does not provide the statement and certificate for which the bank has asked , then the bank will not , in the absence of other evidence , have reasonable grounds for being satisfied that the wife 's agreement has been properly obtained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1041	Its legal rights will be subject to any equity existing in favour of the wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1042	INDIVIDUAL CASES 123 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1043	Turning to the individual appeals , the cases fall into 3 different categories . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1044	There are three cases - Harris , Wallace and Moore - which have not got beyond the interlocutory stage , the wives ' pleadings having been struck out as disclosing no defence to the banks ' claims for possession . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1045	There are four cases - Etridge , Gill , Coleman and Bennett - which have proceeded to trial and in which , at trial and/or on appeal , the wife has been unsuccessful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1046	Finally there is a single case - Kenyon-Brown - in which the wife was suing her solicitor for damages for breach of duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1047	Your Lordships are in favour of allowing the appeals in Kenyon-Brown , Harris , Wallace , Moore and Bennett : I agree . 	lord hobhouse	self	outcome	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1048	I also agree that the appeals in Etridge , Gill and Coleman should be dismissed . 	lord hobhouse	self	outcome	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1049	There is an important distinction to be drawn between cases which have been tried where the parties have been able to test the opposing case and the trial judge was able to make findings of fact having seen the critical witnesses and evaluated the evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1050	By contrast , in those cases where the lender is applying for an immediate possession order without a trial or to have the defence struck out , the court is being asked to hold that , even if the wife 's allegations of fact be accepted , the wife 's case is hopeless and bound to fail and that there is no reason why the case should go to trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1051	This conclusion is not to be arrived at lightly nor should such an order be made simply on the basis that the lender is more likely to succeed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1052	Once it is accepted that the wife has raised an arguable case that she was in fact the victim of undue influence and that the bank had been put on enquiry , it will have to be a very clear case before one can say that the bank should not have to justify its conduct at a trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1053	Kenyon-Brown : 124 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1054	I take this case first because it falls into a different category to the others . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1055	The wife was claiming damages against a firm of solicitors on the basis that , under the undue influence of her husband , she had entered into an adverse suretyship transaction for the benefit of her husband , which also involved charging a cottage which they jointly owned , and that the solicitors had failed to give her appropriate advice to prevent this happening .

154	1056	The guarantee was unlimited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1057	The wife was unable to give specific or reliable evidence in support of her case against the solicitors but relied upon the fact that the transaction was manifestly disadvantageous to her and upon the duty of the solicitor , as stated by the Court of Appeal in Etridge No2 -LSB- 1998 -RSB- 4 All ER 705 at para 19 , to satisfy himself that she was free from improper influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1058	The certificate which the solicitor gave to the lender was that he had given her legal advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1059	In Kenyon-Brown , the majority of the Court of Appeal , in disagreement with the trial judge , considered that this led inexorably to the conclusion that the solicitor must have been negligent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1060	I agree with your Lordships that the conclusion of the Court of Appeal was not justified upon the evidence adduced at the trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1061	The burden of proof was upon the wife to establish that the solicitor had been negligent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1062	She could not say that she had not been given comprehensive advice which included a full warning of the consequences of her entering into the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1063	She could not contradict that he had told her specifically that the mortgage would only benefit her husband and was without limit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1064	He was her solicitor and advised her as his client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1065	The judge was right : she failed to make out her case against the solicitor on the facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1066	If she had been able to give reliable evidence and be clearer about what she said had happened and had been in a position to challenge the solicitor 's attendance note , she might have succeeded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1067	The solicitor 's duty towards her was as stated by my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls . 	lord hobhouse	lord nicholls	partagr	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1068	It seems that it was substantially observed and in so far as the solicitor might be criticised , no causative relevance was established . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1069	Wallace : 125 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1070	This was an interlocutory case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1071	The bank claimed the possession of a flat in Priory Road , Hampstead , which was jointly owned by Mr and Mrs Wallace . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1072	The bank claimed possession on the basis of an all monies legal charge signed by the husband and the wife against which the bank had advanced money to the husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1073	It was accepted that she had an arguable case that she had been unduly influenced to sign by her husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1074	The bank did not at any stage communicate with the wife or anyone acting for her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1075	It sent the charge to its own solicitor with instructions to attend to the necessary formalities in the signing of the charge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1076	The husband and wife went together to the bank 's solicitor 's office . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1077	The wife 's case was that she was there 3 or 4 minutes at most ; she signed as directed by the solicitor ; there was no other discussion ; her impression was that the solicitor had been instructed by the bank merely to take and witness her signature . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1078	On this case the bank had no basis for rebutting the risk that her signature had not been properly obtained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1079	It had no basis for any belief that she had been separately advised by a solicitor who was acting for her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1080	The only solicitor of which the bank knew was a solicitor acting for itself alone which had in a side letter to the bank , of which the wife knew nothing , told the bank no more than that the documents had been explained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1081	The wife clearly had an arguable case for defending the possession action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1082	The reasoning of the Court of Appeal in arriving at the contrary conclusion was that the bank was -LRB- or , perhaps , would have been -RRB- entitled to assume that the solicitor had been acting as the wife 's solicitor and had discharged his duty to her as her solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1083	As stated , this assumption would have been without foundation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1084	I agree that this appeal should be allowed . 	lord hobhouse	self	outcome	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1085	Harris : 126 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1086	This was also an interlocutory case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1087	The judge struck out her defence and counterclaim as disclosing no arguable defence to the bank 's action for the possession of the house owned jointly by the husband and wife where they lived . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1088	The husband had , through the medium of two companies , two businesses one of which had effectively failed leaving him with a heavy personal liability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1089	He consulted solicitors , Wragge & Co , to find a way of carrying on his other business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1090	They advised him to negotiate a new facility with the bank with new security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1091	The outcome was an offer from the bank of new finance for the second company secured by unlimited guarantees from both the husband and wife and a legal charge on their house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1092	The bank was clearly put on enquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1093	It was accepted that for striking out purposes the wife had an arguable case on undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1094	The relevant question was therefore whether the bank took reasonable steps to satisfy itself that the wife 's agreement had not been improperly obtained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1095	Wragge & Co were only known to the bank as the husband 's solicitors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1096	The bank took no steps to communicate with the wife who was allowed to remain in ignorance of what precisely was the position between her husband and the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1097	The wife was never told that she would be required to be separately advised nor that she should instruct a solicitor to certify to the bank that she had been so advised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1098	In her pleading the wife had pleaded that the solicitors were acting for the bank , her husband and herself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1099	However before the judge the affidavit sworn by her solicitor in the action -LRB- Mr Holt of Evans Derry Binnion -RRB- in response to the bank 's striking out application deposed -LRB- para 6 -RRB- - `` It is important to note that insofar as my client is concerned Wragge & Co were not her solicitors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1100	Wragge & Co were solicitors who had been instructed by Mr Harris personally previously and he had a personal connection with one of the partners at that -LSB- firm -RSB- . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1101	The wife therefore has an arguable case that Wragge & Co were never her solicitors and that the case is in this respect the same as the Wallace case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1102	There is however a further feature of this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1103	The bank wrote to Wragge & Co , knowing them only as the husband 's solicitors , asking them , among other things , `` to explain the nature of the document to both parties and confirm to us that independent legal advice has been given '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1104	The letter in reply from Wragge & Co did not give the bank that confirmation , a fact which the bank did not pick up until about nine months later . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1105	The bank then wrote to Wragge & Co pointing this out and asking for confirmation that independent legal advice had nevertheless been given . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1106	On receiving this further letter , the partner at Wragge & Co commented : `` I do not think that independent legal advice was given . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1107	On this , it would appear that the bank appreciated that it needed confirmation that the wife had been independently advised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1108	Patently it did not get it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1109	The bank realised that it had not got it and that she may well never have been independently advised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1110	This was clearly a case where the judge should have allowed the case to go to trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1111	The wife had an arguable defence on more than one ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1112	The Court of Appeal dismissed the wife 's appeal giving only brief reasons - `` The solicitors were acting for Mrs Harris and the bank were entitled to assume that they had given appropriate advice and were entitled to accept the solicitors ' letter as confirmation that this had been done . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1113	These reasons fly in the face of the evidence and can not be supported . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1114	This appeal should be allowed . 	lord hobhouse	self	outcome	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1115	Moore : 127 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1116	This is the third of the interlocutory cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1117	It is less clear cut than the other two . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1118	But it is not a case in which it should be said , in my judgment , that no trial is justified and that , on the basis of her pleaded case , the wife is bound to fail in her defence of the possession action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1119	It is accepted for present purposes that she has an arguable case of undue influence and misrepresentation by her husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1120	Her case is that she had in fact instructed no solicitors to act for her and received no advice whatsoever . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1121	The charge was unlimited in amount . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1122	The loan transaction was not wholly straightforward in that , whilst it included the refinancing of indebtedness which was already secured on the matrimonial home in Pangbourne , it was as to 3/5ths composed of a substantial additional advance to the company run by the husband which was already in financial trouble -LRB- and was to fail within two years -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1123	In this connection , the company and the husband used an independent insurance broker , Mr Zerfahs and his brother -LRB- a credit broker -RRB- , as a go-between with the lender . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1124	The lender had no direct communication with the wife , nor did Mr Zerfahs communicate with her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1125	Were it not for one fact , this would be a case which fell into the same category as Wallace . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1126	The potential saving fact for the lender was that the husband had started his deception by persuading his wife to sign the mortgage application form in blank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1127	One of the boxes in the form was `` solicitor 's details '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
154	1128	The husband , who was the primary applicant , filled this in with the name of the solicitors who had been instructed by Mr Zerfahs without informing the wife or obtaining her authority : `` Quiney & Harris -LRB- Nigel Whittaker -RRB- '' and their address in Wootton Bassett near Swindon . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1129	As a result , on the face of the form sent to the lender there was a single solicitor who was to act on behalf of both applicants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1130	The wife says that the husband had not obtained her authority to fill in the form in this way ; it is agreed that the husband undoubtedly filled in other parts of the form fraudulently . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1131	Having received instructions from Mr Zerfahs , the solicitors , without obtaining confiration from the wife , referred to her and her husband in correspondence as `` our clients '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1132	The lender did not obtain any assurance that the wife had received independent advice before signing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1133	It is the wife 's case that she received no advice at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1134	This is a disturbing case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1135	It may turn out -LRB- if there is a trial -RRB- that the wife is an unreliable witness and that her case can not be accepted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1136	But , for present purposes , the lender 's case has to depend wholly upon an estoppel arising from her having signed the application form in blank and , it is argued , an inference that she had been separately advised as an independent client by the solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1137	I do not believe that this is a sound basis for disposing of this case without a trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1138	The true facts need to be known . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1139	She was the victim of misrepresentation ; the solicitors purported to act on her behalf without any authority to do so ; the only document which the lender saw did not suggest anything other than a joint retainer ; the lender never checked the position with the wife or sought any confirmation that she was being separately advised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1140	Discovery of documents and a morning in the County Court would have sorted the matter out more expeditiously and cheaply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1141	I agree that this appeal should be allowed . 	lord hobhouse	self	outcome	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1142	Royal Bank of Scotland v Etridge : 128 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1143	This is a case which , after some delay and contested interlocutory proceedings , went to a trial before Judge Behrens . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1144	The wife gave evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1145	The judge found that , on the evidence , she had not been the victim of any actual undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1146	However he went on to deal with the case on the basis of presumed undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1147	On appeal , the Court of Appeal upheld the Judge 's finding of no actual undue influence ; nor did she at either level obtain a finding in her favour that she had been induced to sign by any misrepresentation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1148	Accordingly , on the correct view of the law , her case failed in limine and none of the other points arose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1149	Judgment was rightly entered for the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1150	On this ground , I agree that this appeal should be dismissed . 	lord hobhouse	self	outcome	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1151	This case provides an object lesson in the dangers of attempting a summary resolution of issues of mixed law and fact without having ascertained the facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1152	Gill : 129 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1153	This too is a case which went to trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1154	The evidence discloses what might have been a case of misrepresentation which possibly could have led to the wife succeeding . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1155	The transaction was presented in a fashion which may have led the wife and the solicitors mistakenly to believe that only an advance of # 36,000 was involved , not a probable # 100,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1156	However , be that as it may , the case advanced by the wife at the trial was that she had been the victim of actual undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1157	This case was rejected by the Judge and , in any event , there was evidence that the extended scope of the transaction is something which she would in fact have supported and was not causative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1158	Therefore this case is , in the critical respect , similar to the Etridge case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1159	She failed to prove the allegation necessary to found her case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1160	I agree that this appeal should be dismissed . 	lord hobhouse	self	outcome	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1161	Coleman : 130 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1162	In this case there was a trial which was not confined to a simple claim by the bank against the wife ; it involved also her husband -LRB- who in addition counterclaimed against the bank -RRB- and third parties joined by the wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1163	With some reluctance I agree that the wife 's appeal should be dismissed . 	lord hobhouse	self	outcome	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1164	This is not because of any inherent lack of merit in her case ; she has been appallingly badly served . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1165	It is because to set aside the judgments entered against her below would be contrary to the grounds upon which her case was conducted at the trial and in the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1166	The wife and her husband were members of the Hasidic Jewish community . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1167	This factually involved a relationship of complete trust and confidence between the wife and her husband in relation to financial matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1168	I agree with Lord Scott that it is a case where , having drawn the appropriate inferences , actual undue influence was in fact established . 	lord hobhouse	lord scott	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1169	The wife was being asked to charge her home to secure advances to her husband for the purpose of enabling him to engage in property speculation , he being unable to offer the bank adequate other security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1170	It was also a case where the bank was clearly put on enquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1171	The relevant point which should have been considered was therefore whether the bank took steps of the kind referred to by Lord Nicholls -LRB- para 79 -RRB- -LRB- or in the National Westminster document -RRB- in order to protect itself from being affected by any such undue influence . 	lord hobhouse	lord nicholls	partagr	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1172	But at the trial the dealings between the bank and the wife and the solicitor were not covered by documentary evidence and seem not to have been the subject of direct oral evidence either . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1173	The wife simply said that she went to the solicitor 's office at the request of her husband and that all the managing clerk , whom they saw there , did before witnessing her signature was to ask her in the presence of her husband if he , her husband , had explained the documents to her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1174	Her account -LRB- which the judge accepted -RRB- gives a pertinent reminder of the gap between theory and reality and illustrates the type of charade which , as Sir Peter Millett has observed -LRB- sup -RRB- , lenders well know may occur and should not be tolerated or sanctioned by equity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1175	However , at the trial , the wife 's case was that the elderly solicitor for whom the managing clerk worked was acting as her solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1176	She joined what she thought were the appropriate persons as third parties suing them for breach of professional duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1177	The elderly solicitor had died . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1178	The trial judge dismissed her claim against the third parties holding that she had sued the wrong persons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1179	There was a further unusual feature of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1180	The bank had asked for a certificate in the unusual terms : `` I confirm that this document was signed in my presence and that the full effect of its contents have been explained to and were understood by Miriam Mara Coleman , and she has signed this document of her own free will . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1181	-LRB- emphasis supplied . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1182	It was this certificate that the managing clerk signed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1183	If the bank were entitled to believe that this certificate was supplied by the wife 's own solicitor instructed by her , the bank might have had a basis for believing that the wife 's consent had been properly obtained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1184	I venture to doubt whether any reasonable banker would have put this construction upon the available evidence but in view of the course of the proceedings before the trial judge and the basis upon which the wife 's case was then put it would not be permissible now to allow this appeal upon an inconsistent and untested basis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1185	The greater part of the time at the trial seems to have been taken up with the dispute between the husband and the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1186	As between the wife and the bank , the judgments in the courts below were primarily concerned with aspects of the problem of presumed undue influence which do not now arise and with the question of the adequacy of a certificate signed by a legal executive as opposed to a solicitor which must depend on the facts of each case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1187	Bennett : 131 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1188	I agree that this appeal should be allowed . 	lord hobhouse	self	outcome	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1189	The existence of the ranking agreement was important and qualified the transaction as it was disclosed to the surety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1190	I do not wish to add anything to what is to be said about this point by Lord Scott . 	lord hobhouse	lord scott	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1191	This suffices for the allowing of the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1192	It is accordingly unnecessary to say anything about the undue influence issues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1193	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1194	LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1195	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1196	Introduction 132 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1197	Eight appeals have been heard together . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1198	In seven of these appeals , the appellant is a wife who agreed to subject her property , usually her interest in the matrimonial home , to a charge in favour of a bank in order to provide security for the payment of her husband 's debts , or the debts of a company by means of which her husband carried on business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1199	In each of these cases the bank has commenced proceedings for possession of the mortgaged property with a view to its sale and the wife has defended the claim by alleging , first , that her agreement to grant the charge to the bank was brought about by undue influence or misrepresentation , or both , on the part of her husband , and , secondly , that , in the circumstances , the chargee bank ought not to be allowed to enforce the charge against her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1200	In each of these cases the question has been raised whether the bank should be treated as having had notice of the impropriety , or alleged impropriety , of the husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1201	In each of these cases the bank has had some reason to believe that a solicitor had acted for the wife in the transaction in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1202	So the question has arisen as to the extent to which the solicitor 's participation , or believed participation , has absolved the bank of the need to make any further inquiries about the circumstances in which the wife was persuaded to agree to grant the charge , or to take any further steps to satisfy itself that her consent to do so was a true and informed consent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1203	133 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1204	Four of these seven cases , Etridge , Gill , Coleman and Bennett went to a full trial , with evidence and cross-examination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1205	The other three , Harris , Wallace and Moore , have come to your Lordships ' House as a result of interlocutory applications ; in Harris and in Moore , an application to strike-out the relevant parts of the wife 's defence ; in Wallace , an application by the bank for summary judgment for possession .

154	1207	In each of these seven cases , the submissions on behalf of the wife have been based upon the principles expressed by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in Barclays Bank Plc v O'Brien -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 180 and , to a lesser extent , in CIBC Mortgages Plc v Pitt -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 200 .

154	1209	The eighth appeal before the House , Kenyon-Brown v Desmond Banks & Co , is a case in which the wife is suing the solicitor who acted for her in such a transaction as I have described . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1210	She alleges breach of duty by the solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1211	One of the issues in the seven wife v bank appeals that your Lordships are invited to consider relates to the extent of the duty lying upon a solicitor who acts for a wife who is proposing to grant a charge over her property as security for her husband 's , or his company 's , debts .

154	1212	It was , therefore , thought convenient to add the Kenyon-Brown appeal to the seven other appeals so that all could be heard together . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls

154	1214	Five of the seven wife v bank appeals , namely , Etridge , Harris , Moore , Wallace and Gill , were heard together by the Court of Appeal -LRB- Stuart-Smith , Millett and Morritt LJJ -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1215	In each , the Court of Appeal dismissed the wife 's appeal against the order for possession made by the Court below -LRB- see Royal Bank of Scotland Plc v Etridge -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 1998 -RSB- 4 All ER 705 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls

154	1222	In deciding these appeals it is necessary in my opinion , first , to analyse and explain the principles formulated by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in O'Brien . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1223	The case law since O'Brien has , in my view , disclosed some misconceptions about these principles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1224	The O'Brien principles 139 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1225	It is convenient to start with a look at the problems that had to be addressed in O'Brien and at Lord Browne-Wilkinson 's solution to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1226	140 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1227	There had been an increasing number of cases in which wives had sought to avoid the charges they had given to banks or finance houses in support of their husbands ' debts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1228	In many , probably in most , of the cases that had come to court , the wives had not read , or , if they had , had not understood the document they had signed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1229	Many of the wives protested that they had signed because excessive pressure to do so had been brought to bear on them by their husbands ; others said that their husbands had misrepresented the amount of the secured debts , the time during which the charge would remain in force or some other material matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1230	In most cases the wife emphasised , in explaining her willingness to sign the charge , the trust and confidence she had had in her husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1231	This trust and confidence , it was said , had led her to succumb to his pressure to sign and to be the more easily misled by his misrepresentations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1232	Lord Browne-Wilkinson in O'Brien said , at p 188 : `` although the concept of the ignorant wife leaving all financial decisions to the husband is outmoded , the practice does not yet coincide with the ideal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1233	In a substantial proportion of marriages it is still the husband who has the business experience and the wife is willing to follow his advice without bringing a truly independent mind and will to bear on financial decisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1234	The number of recent cases in this field shows that in practice many wives are still subjected to , and yield to , undue influence by their husbands . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1235	Such wives can reasonably look to the law for some protection when their husbands have abused the trust and confidence reposed in them . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1236	141 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1237	Lord Browne-Wilkinson emphasised , however , the importance of keeping a sense of balance in deciding what degree of protection should be afforded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1238	He pointed out that `` a high proportion of privately owned wealth is invested in the matrimonial home . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1239	and referred to `` the need to ensure that the wealth currently tied up in the matrimonial home does not become economically sterile '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1240	He added , at p 188 : `` If the rights secured to wives by the law renders vulnerable loans granted on the security of matrimonial homes , institutions will be unwilling to accept such security , thereby reducing the flow of loan capital to business enterprises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1241	It is therefore essential that a law designed to protect the vulnerable does not render the matrimonial home unacceptable as security to financial institutions . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1242	Each of these considerations is as relevant and important today as it was when O'Brien was decided . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1243	142 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1244	One of the difficulties is that the protection the wife needs in these cases is a remedy against the bank , or other lender , to whom she is offering the suretyship security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1245	It is not protection against her husband , who has allegedly procured her to do so by some wrongdoing , that is the problem . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1246	The law has no difficulty in providing an oppressed or deceived wife with a remedy against the wrongdoing husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1247	But , in most of the cases with which the House is now concerned , the husband is supporting his wife in her attempt to prevent the bank from enforcing its security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1248	They stand together in attempting to save the family home . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1249	In these circumstances , Lord Browne-Wilkinson held that the requisite protection for wives against the banks should be provided by the application of the doctrine of constructive notice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1250	He had in mind that in certain circumstances constructive notice of the husband 's impropriety towards his wife could be imputed to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1251	143 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1252	The doctrine of notice is a doctrine that relates primarily and traditionally to the priority of competing property rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1253	Lord Browne-Wilkinson described the operation of the doctrine in this way , at pp 195-196 : `` the earlier right prevails against the later right if the acquirer of the later right knows of the earlier right -LRB- actual notice -RRB- or would have discovered it had he taken proper steps -LRB- constructive notice -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1254	In particular , if the party asserting that he takes free of the earlier rights of another knows of certain facts which put him on inquiry as to the possible existence of the rights of that other and he fails to make such inquiry or to take such other steps as are reasonable to verify whether such earlier right does or does not exist , he will have constructive notice of the earlier right and take subject to it . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1255	This is a classic statement of the operation of the doctrine of notice in order to determine the priority of property rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1256	144 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1257	Banks and other lenders who take charges from surety wives are certainly purchasers of property rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1258	But they acquire their rights by grant from the surety wives themselves . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1259	The issue between the banks and the surety wives is not one of priority of competing interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1260	The issue is whether or not the surety wife is to be bound by her apparent consent to the grant of the security to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1261	If contractual consent has been procured by undue influence or misrepresentation for which a party to the contract is responsible , the other party , the victim , is entitled , subject to the usual defences of change of position , affirmation , delay etc , to avoid the contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1262	But the case is much more difficult if the undue influence has been exerted or the misrepresentation has been made not by the party with whom the victim has contracted , but by a third party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1263	It is , in general , the objective manifestation of contractual consent that is critical . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1264	Deficiencies in the quality of consent to a contract by a contracting party , brought about by undue influence or misrepresentation by a third party , do not , in general allow the victim to avoid the contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1265	But if the other contracting party had had actual knowledge of the undue influence or misrepresentation the victim would not , in my opinion , be held to the contract -LRB- see Commission for the New Towns v Cooper -LRB- Great Britain -RRB- Ltd -LSB- 1995 -RSB- Ch 259 , 277-280 and Banco Exterior Internacional SA v Thomas -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 1 WLR 221 , 229 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1266	But what if there had been no actual knowledge of the third party 's undue influence or misrepresentation but merely knowledge of facts or circumstances that , if investigated , might have led to actual knowledge ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1267	In what circumstances does the law expect a contracting party to inquire into the reasons why the other party is entering into the contract or to go behind the other party 's apparent agreement , objectively ascertained , to enter into the contract ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1268	These are the questions that Lord Browne-Wilkinson had to answer in O'Brien . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1269	They are contractual questions , not questions relating to competing property interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1270	145 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1271	Care must , in my opinion , be taken in applying principles evolved in cases in which the issue has been whether a purchaser was bound by some pre-existing equitable interest in the purchased property to cases in which the issue is whether a contracting party can safely rely on the other contracting party 's apparent consent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1272	Among other things , the onus is different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1273	If a purchaser acquires property over which there is an existing equitable interest , for example , an equitable charge , it is up to the purchaser to show that he is a purchaser without notice and so is not bound by the equitable interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1274	He must show that his conscience is clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1275	But if a contracting party , A , acquires an interest under a contract with another contracting party , B , and B wishes to escape from the contract on the ground that his consent to it was procured by the undue influence or a misrepresentation of a third party , A can rely on B 's apparent consent to the contract and it is for B to show that A had actual or constructive notice of the undue influence or misrepresentation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1276	It is , in my opinion , important to recognise that constructive notice , in cases such as those now before the House , is serving a different function from that served by constructive notice in its traditional role and is not necessarily subject to the same rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1277	146 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1278	In particular , it must be recognised that in the bank v surety wife cases the constructive notice that is sought to be attributed to the bank is not constructive notice of any pre-existing prior right or prior equity of the wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1279	The husband 's impropriety , whether undue influence or misrepresentation , in procuring his wife to enter into a suretyship transaction with the bank would not entitle her to set it aside unless the bank had had notice of the impropriety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1280	It is notice of the husband 's impropriety that the bank must have , not notice of any prior rights of the wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1281	It is the notice that the bank has of the impropriety that creates the wife 's right to set aside the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1282	The wife does not have any prior right or prior equity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1283	147 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1284	In a case where the financial arrangements with the bank had been negotiated by the husband , no part in the negotiations having been played by the wife , and where the arrangements required the wife to become surety for her husband 's debts , the bank would , or should , have been aware of the vulnerability of the wife and of the risk that her agreement might be procured by undue influence or misrepresentation by the husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1285	In these circumstances the bank would be `` put on inquiry '' , as Lord Browne-Wilkinson put it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1286	But `` on inquiry '' about what ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1287	Not about the existence of undue influence , for how could any inquiry reasonably to be expected of a bank satisfy the bank that there was no undue influence ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1288	`` On inquiry '' , in my opinion , as to whether the wife understood the nature and effect of the transaction she was entering into . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1289	This is not an `` inquiry '' in the traditional constructive notice sense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1290	The bank would not have to carry out any investigation or to ask any questions about the reasons why the wife was agreeing to the transaction or about her relationship with her husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1291	The bank would not , unless it had notice of additional facts pointing to undue influence or misrepresentation , be on notice that undue influence or misrepresentation was to be presumed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1292	It would simply be on notice of a risk of some such impropriety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1293	What Lord Browne-Wilkinson had in mind was that the bank should be expected to take reasonable steps to satisfy itself that she understood the transaction she was entering into . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1294	If the bank did so , no longer could constructive notice of any impropriety by the husband in procuring his wife 's consent be imputed to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1295	The original constructive notice would have been shed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1296	If , on the other hand , a bank with notice of the risk of some such impropriety , failed to take the requisite reasonable steps , then , if it transpired that the wife 's consent had been procured by the husband 's undue influence or misrepresentation , constructive knowledge that that was so would be imputed to the bank and the wife would have the same remedies as she would have had if the bank had had actual knowledge of the impropriety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1297	148 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1298	Under Lord Browne-Wilkinson 's scheme for the protection of vulnerable wives it is the bank 's perception of the risk that the wife 's consent may have been procured by the husband 's misrepresentation or undue influence that is central . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1299	The risk must be viewed through the eyes of the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1300	Some degree of risk can , usually , never be wholly eliminated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1301	But it can be reduced to a point at which it becomes reasonable for the bank to rely on the apparent consent of the wife to enter into the transaction and to take no further steps to satisfy itself that she understood the transaction she was entering into . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1302	Lord Browne-Wilkinson thought that , in order to reach this point , the bank should itself give the wife an explanation of the nature and effect of the proposed transaction and should advise her to take independent legal advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1303	The function of these steps would be to try and ensure that the wife understood what she was doing in entering into the proposed transaction and that her consent to do so was an informed consent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1304	But whether these steps would always be necessary , or would always be sufficient , would depend on the facts of the particular case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1305	Lord Browne-Wilkinson was not legislating ; he was suggesting steps that , if taken , would in the normal case entitle a bank to rely on the wife 's apparent consent , evidenced by her signature to the document or documents in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1306	149 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1307	In each of the wife v bank appeals now before your Lordships , the transactions pre-dated O'Brien and the bank did not have the advantage of the guidance provided by Lord Browne-Wilkinson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1308	The question to be asked in each of these cases , therefore , is whether at the time the security was granted to the bank , the bank 's perception of the risk that the grant might have been procured by the husband 's impropriety was such as to have required the bank to take some additional steps to satisfy itself that she understood the nature and effect of the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1309	150 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1310	Since Lord Browne-Wilkinson 's constructive notice route for providing protection to vulnerable wives who agree to become sureties for their husband 's debts was substantially based on the risk that the wife might have been subjected to undue influence by her husband , it is necessary to review the principles of undue influence on which he built that protection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1311	Undue influence 151 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1312	Undue influence cases have , traditionally , been regarded as falling into two classes , cases where undue influence must be affirmatively proved -LRB- Class 1 -RRB- and cases where undue influence will be presumed -LRB- Class 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1313	The nature of the two classes was described by Slade LJ in Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA -LSB- 1990 -RSB- 1 QB 923 , at p 953 : `` Ever since the judgments of this court in Allcard v Skinner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1314	a clear distinction has been drawn between -LRB- 1 -RRB- those cases in which the court will uphold a plea of undue influence only if it is satisfied that such influence has been affirmatively proved on the evidence -LRB- commonly referred to as cases of ` actual undue influence ' ` Class 1 ' cases -RRB- ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- those cases -LRB- commonly referred to as cases of ` presumed undue influence ' ` Class 2 ' cases -RRB- in which the relationship between the parties will lead the court to presume that undue influence has been exerted unless evidence is adduced proving the contrary , eg by showing that the complaining party has had independent advice '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1315	152 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1316	This passage provides , if I may respectfully say so , an accurate summary description of the two classes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1317	But , like most summaries , it requires some qualification . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1318	153 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1319	First , the Class 2 presumption is an evidential rebuttable presumption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1320	It shifts the onus from the party who is alleging undue influence to the party who is denying it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1321	Second , the weight of the presumption will vary from case to case and will depend both on the particular nature of the relationship and on the particular nature of the impugned transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1322	Third , the type and weight of evidence needed to rebut the presumption will obviously depend upon the weight of the presumption itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1323	In Allcard v Skinner -LRB- 1887 -RRB- 36 Ch D 145 the presumption was a very heavy one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1324	Correspondingly strong evidence would have been needed to rebut it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1325	Even independent legal advice would not necessarily have sufficed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1326	Lindley LJ , at p 184 , made clear his view that without legal independent advice the presumption could not have been rebutted but went on to doubt whether independent legal advice would have sufficed `` unless there was also proof that she was free to act on the advice which might be given to her '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1327	And in Inche Noriah v Shaik Allie Bin Omar -LSB- 1929 -RSB- AC 127 Lord Hailsham LC said , at p 135 : `` their Lordships are not prepared to accept the view that independent legal advice is the only way in which the presumption can be rebutted '' 154 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1328	The onus will , of course , lie on the person alleging the undue influence to prove in the first instance sufficient facts to give rise to the presumption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1329	The relationship relied on in support of the presumption will have to be proved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1330	155 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1331	In National Westminster Bank v Morgan -LSB- 1985 -RSB- AC 686 , 704 Lord Scarman , referring to the character of the impugned transaction in a Class 2 case , said : `` it must constitute a disadvantage sufficiently serious to require evidence to rebut the presumption that in the circumstances of the relationship between the parties it was procured by the exercise of undue influence '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1332	Lord Scarman went on : `` In my judgment , therefore , the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the presumption of undue influence can arise from the evidence of the relationship of the parties without also evidence that the transaction itself was wrongful in that it constituted an advantage taken of the person subjected to the influence which , failing proof to the contrary , was explicable only on the basis that undue influence had been exercised to procure it . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1333	With respect to Lord Scarman , the reasoning seems to me to be circular . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1334	The transaction will not be `` wrongful '' unless it was procured by undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1335	Its `` wrongful '' character is a conclusion , not a tool by which to detect the presence of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1336	On the other hand , the nature of the transaction , its inexplicability by reference to the normal motives by which people act , may , and usually will , constitute important evidential material . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls

154	1338	Lord Browne-Wilkinson in CIBC Mortgages Plc v Pitt -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 200 pointed out , plainly correctly , that if undue influence is proved , the victim 's right to have the transaction set aside will not depend upon the disadvantageous quality of the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1339	Where , however a Class 2 presumption of undue influence is said to arise , the nature of the impugned transaction will always be material , no matter what the relationship between the parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1340	Some transactions will be obviously innocuous and innocent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1341	A moderate gift as a Christmas or birthday present would be an example . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1342	A solicitor who is appointed by a client as his executor and given a legacy of a moderate amount if he consents to act , is not put to proof of the absence of undue influence before he can take the legacy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1343	If the nun/postulant/novice in Allcard v Skinner had given moderate Christmas presents to the Mother Superior , or to the Sisterhood , no inference that the gifts had been procured by undue influence could be drawn and no presumption of undue influence would have arisen . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1344	It is , in my opinion , the combination of relationship and the nature of the transaction that gives rise to the presumption and , if the transaction is challenged , shifts the onus to the transferee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1345	157 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1346	In Aboody -LSB- 1990 -RSB- 1 QB 923 Slade LJ split the Class 2 cases into two sub-divisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1347	He categorised , at p 953 , the `` well established categories of relationships , such as a religious superior and inferior and doctor and patient where the relationship as such will give rise to the presumption '' as Class 2A cases , and confirmed that neither a husband/wife relationship nor a banker/customer relationship would normally give rise to the presumption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1348	-LRB- See also National Westminster Bank Plc v Morgan -LSB- 1985 -RSB- AC 686 , 703 and O'Brien -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 180 , 190 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1349	He continued , at p 953 : `` Nevertheless , on particular facts -LRB- frequently referred to in argument as ` Class 2B ' cases -RRB- relationships not falling within the ` Class 2A ' category may be shown to have become such as to justify the court in applying the same presumption . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1350	In O'Brien Lord Browne-Wilkinson adopted Slade LJ 's Class 2B category for the purpose of the surety wife cases that he was considering . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1351	He said , at pp 189-190 : `` Even if there is no relationship falling within Class 2 -LRB- A -RRB- , if the complainant proves the de facto existence of a relationship under which the complainant generally reposed trust and confidence in the wrongdoer , the existence of such relationship raises the presumption of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1352	In a Class 2 -LRB- B -RRB- case , therefore , in the absence of evidence disproving undue influence , the complainant will succeed in setting aside the impugned transaction merely by proof that the complainant reposed trust and confidence in the wrongdoer without having to prove that the wrongdoer exerted actual undue influence or otherwise abused such trust and confidence in relation to the particular transaction impugned . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1353	158 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1354	In my respectful opinion , this passage , at least in its application to the surety wife cases , has set the law on a wrong track . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1355	First , it seems to me to lose sight of the evidential and rebuttable character of the Class 2 presumption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1356	The presumption arises where the combination of the relationship and the nature of the transaction justify , in the absence of any other evidence , a conclusion that the transaction was procured by the undue influence of the dominant party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1357	Such a conclusion , reached on a balance of probabilities , is based upon inferences to be drawn from that combination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1358	There are some relationships , generally of a fiduciary character , where , as a matter of policy , the law requires the dominant party to justify the righteousness of the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1359	These relationships do not include the husband wife relationship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1360	In the surety wife cases , the complainant does have to prove undue influence : the presumption , if it arises on the facts of a particular case , is a tool to assist him or her in doing so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1361	It shifts , for the moment , the onus of proof to the other side . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1362	159 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1363	Second , the passage cited appears to regard a relationship of trust and confidence between a wife and husband as something special rather than as the norm . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1364	For my part , I would assume in every case in which a wife and husband are living together that there is a reciprocal trust and confidence between them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1365	In the fairly common circumstance that the financial and business decisions of the family are primarily taken by the husband , I would assume that the wife would have trust and confidence in his ability to do so and would support his decisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1366	I would not expect evidence to be necessary to establish the existence of that trust and confidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1367	I would expect evidence to be necessary to demonstrate its absence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1368	In cases where experience , probably bitter , had led a wife to doubt the wisdom of her husband 's financial or business decisions , I still would not regard her willingness to support those decisions with her own assets as an indication that he had exerted undue influence over her to persuade her to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1369	Rather I would regard her support as a natural and admirable consequence of the relationship of a mutually loyal married couple . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1370	The proposition that if a wife , who generally reposes trust and confidence in her husband , agrees to become surety to support his debts or his business enterprises a presumption of undue influence arises is one that I am unable to accept . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1371	To regard the husband in such a case as a presumed `` wrongdoer '' does not seem to me consistent with the relationship of trust and confidence that is a part of every healthy marriage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1372	160 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1373	There are , of course , cases where a husband does abuse that trust and confidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1374	He may do so by expressions of quite unjustified over-optimistic enthusiasm about the prospects of success of his business enterprises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1375	He may do so by positive misrepresentation of his business intentions , or of the nature of the security he is asking his wife to grant his creditors , or of some other material matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1376	He may do so by subjecting her to excessive pressure , emotional blackmail or bullying in order to persuade her to sign . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1377	But none of these things should , in my opinion , be presumed merely from the fact of the relationship of general trust and confidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1378	More is needed before the stage is reached at which , in the absence of any other evidence , an inference of undue influence can properly be drawn or a presumption of the existence of undue influence can be said to arise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
154	1379	161 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1380	For my part , I doubt the utility of the Class 2 -LRB- B -RRB- classification . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1381	Class 2 -LRB- A -RRB- is useful in identifying particular relationships where the presumption arises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1382	The presumption in Class 2 -LRB- B -RRB- cases , however , is doing no more than recognising that evidence of the relationship between the dominant and subservient parties , coupled with whatever other evidence is for the time being available , may be sufficient to justify a finding of undue influence on the balance of probabilities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1383	The onus shifts to the defendant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1384	Unless the defendant introduces evidence to counteract the inference of undue influence that the complainant 's evidence justifies , the complainant will succeed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1385	In my opinion , the presumption of undue influence in Class 2 -LRB- B -RRB- cases has the same function in undue influence cases as res ipsa loquitur has in negligence cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1386	It recognises an evidential state of affairs in which the onus has shifted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1387	162 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1388	In the surety wife cases it should , in my opinion , be recognised that undue influence , though a possible explanation for the wife 's agreement to become surety , is a relatively unlikely one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1389	O'Brien itself was a misrepresentation case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1390	Undue influence had been alleged but the undoubted pressure which the husband had brought to bear to persuade his reluctant wife to sign was not regarded by the judge or the Court of Appeal as constituting undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1391	The wife 's will had not been overborne by her husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1392	Nor was O'Brien a case in which , in my opinion , there would have been at any stage in the case a presumption of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1393	The steps to be taken by the creditor bank 163 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1394	The protection that Lord Browne-Wilkinson proposed for the vulnerable surety wives is based upon the undoubted risk that in procuring his wife 's consent to the transaction the husband might have used undue influence or made some material misrepresentation and upon the proposition that the bank must be taken to be aware of the existence of the risk . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1395	So the bank should take reasonable steps to satisfy itself that the wife understands what she is doing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1396	The protection is not based upon the bank 's knowledge of facts from which a presumption of undue influence arises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1397	If , of course , a bank is aware of such facts , the steps the bank will then have to take in order to be able with safety to rely on the wife 's apparent consent to the transaction may be considerable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1398	In his dissenting judgment in Banco Exterior Internacional v Mann -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 1 All ER 936 Hobhouse LJ -LRB- as he then was -RRB- said , at p 948 : `` It must be remembered that the starting point of this exercise is that the wife 's will is being unduly and improperly influenced by the will of her husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1399	The steps taken have to be directed to freeing her of that influence or , at the least , providing some counterbalance . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1400	164 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1401	I respectfully agree that if the bank is indeed aware of facts from which undue influence is to be presumed , the steps to be taken would be of the sort Hobhouse LJ describes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1402	But in the ordinary case the facts of which the bank is aware , or must be taken to be aware , point to no more than the existence of the inevitable risk that there may have been undue influence or some other impropriety and are not facts sufficient by themselves to give rise to a presumption of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1403	In such a case the bank does not have to take steps to satisfy itself that there is no undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1404	It must take steps to satisfy itself that the wife understands the nature and effect of the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1405	165 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1406	Lord Browne-Wilkinson made clear , at -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 180 , 197 , that it would only be in exceptional cases `` where a creditor has knowledge of further facts which render the presence of undue influence not only possible but probable '' that a bank would , to be safe , have to insist that the wife be separately advised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1407	In other cases it would suffice if the bank took steps `` to bring home to the wife the risk she is running by standing as surety and to advise her to take separate advice '' -LRB- p 196 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1408	He added that , as to past transactions - and each of the cases now before the House involves a past transaction - it would depend on the facts of each case whether the bank had satisfied the reasonable steps test . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1409	I would emphasise and repeat that the purpose of the steps , in the ordinary surety wife case , would be to satisfy the bank that the wife understood the nature and effect of the transaction she was entering into . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1410	The problems 166 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1411	The application of the O'Brien principles has , in the appeals now before the House , given rise to some particular problems which are to be found , also , in most of the post O'Brien reported cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1412	Solicitors ' Advice 167 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1413	In a number of cases a firm of solicitors has been acting for the husband in the transaction with the bank and has acted also for the wife in connection with the grant of the security to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1414	In many cases , the same solicitor acting for the husband and the wife has been asked by the bank to act for it in connection with the completion of the security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1415	A number of questions arise : for instance -- 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1416	Does the fact that , to the knowledge of the bank , a solicitor is acting for the wife in the security transaction entitle the bank reasonably to believe that the solicitor will have given her an adequate explanation of the nature and effect of the security document she is to sign ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1417	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1418	If so , are there , in the ordinary case , ie where there is no special reason for the bank to suspect undue influence or other impropriety , any other steps that the bank ought reasonably to take ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1419	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1420	If the answer to question 1 is ` yes ' and to question 2 is ` No ' , does the fact that the solicitor is also the husband 's solicitor and is acting for the bank in arranging for completion of the security bar the bank from relying on the solicitor 's role in acting for the wife ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1421	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1422	In many cases the solicitor in whose offices the wife has signed the security document has confirmed , sometimes on the document itself and sometimes in a covering letter to the bank , that the nature and effect of the document has first been explained to the wife and that she has appeared to understand it and to be entering freely into the transaction , or to that effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1423	If in these cases the solicitor has in fact given no , or no adequate , explanation of the document to the wife , in what circumstances can the solicitor 's knowledge of his failure be attributed to the bank ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1424	168 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1425	As to question 1 , the duty of a solicitor towards his client is , in every case , dependent on the instructions , express or implied , that he has received from his client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1426	A solicitor acting for a client in connection with a proposed transaction under which the client is to become surety or give security for the debts of another will not necessarily have instructions to advise the client about the nature and effect of the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1427	In most cases such instructions , if not express , would , I think , be implied ; but it is at least possible that the circumstances of the solicitor 's retainer would not require him to give such advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1428	So , in my opinion , knowledge by a bank that a solicitor is acting for a surety wife does not , without more , justify the bank in assuming that the solicitor 's instructions extend to advising her about the nature and effect of the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1429	169 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1430	Normally , however , a solicitor , instructed to act for a surety wife in connection with a suretyship transaction would owe a duty to the wife to explain to her the nature and effect of the document or documents she was to sign . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1431	Exactly what the explanation should consist of would obviously depend in each case on the facts of that case and on any particular concerns that the wife might have communicated to the solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1432	In general , however , the solicitor should , in my opinion : -LRB- i -RRB- explain to the wife , on a worst case footing , the steps the bank might take to enforce its security ; -LRB- ii -RRB- make sure the wife understands the extent of the liabilities that may come to be secured under the security ; -LRB- iii -RRB- explain the likely duration of the security ; -LRB- iv -RRB- ascertain whether the wife is aware of any existing indebtedness that will , if she grants the security , be secured under it ; -LRB- v -RRB- explain to the wife that he may need to give the bank a written confirmation that he has advised her about the nature and effect of the proposed transaction and obtain her consent to his doing so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1433	170 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1434	I think the solicitor should , probably , begin by trying to discover from the wife her understanding of the proposed transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1435	He , the solicitor , may then be in a position to remedy any misapprehensions and cure any misrepresentations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1436	171 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1437	A bank , proposing to take a security from a surety wife for whom a solicitor is acting , requires , first , confirmation that the solicitor 's instructions do extend to advising her about the nature and effect of the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1438	Subject to that confirmation , however , the bank is , in my opinion , entitled reasonably to believe that the solicitor will have advised her on the matters to which I have referred and , accordingly , that she has had an adequate explanation and has an adequate understanding of the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1439	172 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1440	As to question 2 , there are , in my opinion , in the ordinary case and subject to the points about disclosure that I will make later , no other steps that the bank can reasonably be required to take . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1441	In particular the bank does not , in order to be able safely to rely on the security being offered , have to advise the wife about the wisdom of her entry into the transaction , or about the bank 's opinion of the financial state or business prospects of the principal debtor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1442	173 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1443	As to question 3 , the fact that the solicitor is acting also for the bank in arranging for completion of the security does not , in my opinion , alter the answers to questions 1 and 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1444	The solicitor 's role in acting for the bank is essentially administrative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1445	He must see that the security document is validly executed and , if necessary , see to its registration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1446	If there are documents of title to whose custody the bank , as chargee , is entitled , the solicitor will usually have to obtain them and hold them to the bank 's order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1447	But he has no consultative role vis a vis the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1448	His duties to the bank do not , in my opinion , in the least prejudice his suitability to advise the wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1449	174 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1450	If the solicitor is acting also for the husband , his role presents a little more difficulty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1451	It is , after all , the existence of the risk of undue influence or misrepresentation by the husband that requires the bank to be reasonably satisfied that the wife understands the nature and effect of the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1452	If there is some particular reason known to the bank for suspecting undue influence or other impropriety by the husband , then , in my view , the bank should insist on advice being given to the wife by a solicitor independent of the husband -LRB- see Lord Browne-Wilkinson in O'Brien , at p 197 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1453	But in a case in which there is no such particular reason , and the risk is no more than the possibility , present in all surety wife cases , of impropriety by the husband , there is no reason , in my opinion , why the solicitor advising the wife should not also be the husband 's solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1454	In the ordinary case , in my opinion , the bank is entitled to rely on the professional competence and propriety of the solicitor in providing proper and adequate advice to the wife notwithstanding that he , the solicitor , is acting also for the husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1455	175 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1456	As to question 4 , if the bank knows or has reason to suspect that the solicitor has not given the wife a proper explanation of the nature and effect of the security document , the bank should take some appropriate steps to remedy the failure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1457	The failure of the solicitor to give the bank written confirmation that he has given the wife such an explanation will in many cases give the bank reason to suspect that he has not done so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1458	In general , however , it will be reasonable for the bank to believe that the solicitor has properly discharged his professional duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1459	176 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1460	Mr Sher QC , counsel for five of the wives , placed some reliance on section 199 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- ii -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- of the Law of Property Act 1925 : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- A purchaser shall not be prejudicially affected by notice of -- -LRB- ii -RRB- any matter or any fact or thing unless -- -LRB- b -RRB- in the same transaction with respect to which a question of notice to the purchaser arises , it has come to the knowledge of his counsel , as such , or of his solicitor or other agent , as such . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1461	177 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1462	Mr Sher submitted that if a solicitor was instructed by a bank to arrange on its behalf for completion of a security to be granted by a surety wife , the solicitor was , for the purpose of any explanation or advice to be given to the wife , acting not only as the wife 's solicitor but also as the bank 's solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1463	That being so , the solicitor 's knowledge of his own failure should , Mr Sher submitted , be attributed to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1464	Particularly , he submitted , this should be so if the solicitor 's instructions from the bank had included a request that the solicitor give appropriate advice to the wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1465	178 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1466	A distinction must , in my opinion , be drawn between the case where the solicitor , as well as having instructions from the bank , is solicitor for the wife and the case where the solicitor 's only instructions come from the bank and the bank is his only client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1467	In the former case , the solicitor ' s duty , so far as advice to the wife is concerned , is owed to her and her alone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1468	The fact that a request for him to advise her may have been made by the bank is immaterial on this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1469	It follows that in advising her the solicitor is not acting as the bank 's solicitor and section 199 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- ii -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- does not apply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1470	179 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1471	A different conclusion must , in my opinion , be reached if the solicitor in question never does become the wife 's solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1472	The formation of a solicitor/client relationship may come about by express retainer or the retainer may be implied by conduct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1473	But whichever it is , it is not a relationship which can be brought into existence by the solicitor unilaterally . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1474	In making these comments I have in mind the assumed facts in Wallace that are more fully set out below -LRB- see pp 92-94 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1475	Shortly stated , the bank asked the solicitor to arrange for completion of the security and to advise the wife about it , the solicitor represented to the bank that he had advised the wife , the bank had no reason to doubt that that was so , but in fact the solicitor had given no advice or tendered any other services to the wife , other than witnessing her signature , a service for which he charged the bank , and she had had no reason to and did not regard him as acting for her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1476	In those circumstances , the solicitor was , in my opinion , acting for the bank alone and his knowledge that no one had given the wife any explanation or advice about the security document could properly be attributed to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1477	But , as I have said , in cases where the solicitor has become the wife 's solicitor and owes her a duty to advise her about the security document , his knowledge of his own failure to discharge that duty can not , in my view , be attributed to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls

154	1479	In Etridge -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 1998 -RSB- 4 All ER 705 , 721 Stuart-Smith LJ set out , in para 44 , a number of propositions , -LRB- 1 -RRB- to -LRB- 6 -RRB- , relating to legal advice to a surety wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1480	I respectfully agree with all these propositions , save that knowledge by a bank of special facts pointing to undue influence might require a different approach and that where the solicitor was acting only for the bank and had never become the solicitor for the wife , his knowledge of what had or had not taken place regarding advice to the wife might well be imputed to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1481	181 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1482	At p 715 , para 19 of the Etridge -LRB- No 2 -RRB- judgment Stuart-Smith LJ expressed the view of the court as to the duty owed by a solicitor `` instructed to advise a person who may be subject to the undue influence of another '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1483	He said : `` It is not sufficient to explain the documentation and ensure that she understands the nature of the transaction and wishes to carry it out . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1484	and : `` His duty is to satisfy himself that his client is free from improper influence , and the first step must be to ascertain whether it is one into which she could sensibly be advised to enter if free from such influence . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1485	182 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1486	These passages were cited and applied by Mance LJ in Kenyon-Brown v Desmond Banks & Co -LSB- 2000 -RSB- PNLR 266 , 273 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1487	I must respectfully dissent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1488	The duty thus described may be applicable in a case in which the solicitor has had something or other drawn to his attention which arouses suspicion that the wife may be the victim of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1489	In the ordinary case , however , where there is no more than a normal relationship of trust and confidence , financial arrangements negotiated by the husband with the bank and the wife proposing to become surety for her husband 's , or his company 's , debts , there will be no presumption of undue influence and no reasonable basis for suspicion of its existence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1490	There will be a risk , a possibility , of undue influence or misrepresentation , but no more than that . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1491	The solicitor in such a case does not have a duty to satisfy himself of the absence of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1492	His duty is accurately described as a duty to satisfy himself that his client understands the nature and effect of the transaction and is willing to enter into it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1493	Disclosure 183 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1494	One of the issues that has arisen in several of the cases is as to the extent of disclosure to the surety wife , or to the solicitor acting for her , that is required of the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1495	184 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1496	As to this , the wife 's understanding of the nature and effect of the security document she is asked to sign should , obviously , be an informed understanding . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1497	It is necessary , it seems to me , to consider , first , the extent of the obligation of disclosure to a would-be surety that lies generally upon the creditor and , secondly , to consider whether any additional disclosure has to be made where a wife is proposing to stand surety for her husband 's debts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1498	The general law 185 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1499	A suretyship contract is not a contract uberrimae fidei . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1500	In Seaton v Heath -LSB- 1899 -RSB- 1 QB 782 Romer LJ said , at p 793 : `` The risk undertaken is generally known to the surety and the circumstances generally point to the view that as between the creditor and surety it was contemplated and intended that the surety should take upon himself to ascertain exactly what risk he was taking upon himself . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1501	186 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1502	But although a would-be surety is , in general , expected to acquaint himself with the risk he is undertaking , the creditor is under an obligation to disclose to the intending surety `` anything which might not naturally be expected to take place between the parties who are concerned in the transaction , that is , whether there be a contract between the debtor and the creditor , to the effect that his position shall be different from that which the surety might naturally expect '' -LRB- per Lord Campbell in Hamilton v Watson -LRB- 1845 -RRB- 12 Cl & F 109 at 119 -RRB- .

154	1505	Vaughan Williams LJ continued , at p 79 : `` Lord Campbell , it is true , takes as his example of what might not be naturally expected an unusual contract between creditor and debtor whose debt the surety guarantees , but I take it this is only an example of the general proposition that a creditor must reveal to the surety every fact which under the circumstances the surety would expect not to exist , for the omission to mention that such a fact does exist is an implied representation that it does not .

154	1507	The general proposition expressed by Vaughan Williams LJ was somewhat extended by King CJ in Pooraka Holdings Pty Ltd v Participation Nominees Pty Ltd -LRB- 1991 -RRB- 58 SASR 184 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1508	The duty of disclosure , said King CJ , extends to any unusual feature surrounding the transaction between the creditor and the surety -LRB- a -RRB- of which the creditor is or ought to be aware , -LRB- b -RRB- of which the surety is unaware , and -LRB- c -RRB- which the creditor appreciates , or in the circumstances ought to appreciate , might be unknown to the surety and might affect the surety 's decision to become a surety .

154	1509	This statement of the extent of the disclosure obligation may be too wide . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1510	But at least , in my opinion , the obligation should extend to unusual features of the contractual relationship between the creditor and the principal debtor , or between the creditor and other creditors of the principal debtor , that would or might affect the rights of the surety -LRB- see generally the discussion of this topic in O'Donovan & Phillips , The Modern Contract of Guarantee , 3rd ed -LRB- 1996 -RRB- , at pp 122-131 -RRB- .

154	1511	Disclosure to surety wives 189 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1512	In general , in my opinion , there is no greater obligation of disclosure owed by a bank , or other creditor , to a surety wife than to any other surety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1513	There is , however , a difference . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1514	Where a wife is offering to stand as surety for her husband 's , or his company 's debts , the risk that her consent to do so may have been improperly procured , requires the creditor , if it is to be able safely to rely on her apparent consent , to take reasonable steps to satisfy itself that she understands what she is doing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1515	In order to satisfy itself about this , and in order that her understanding may be an informed understanding , it may be necessary for the creditor to disclose the amount of any existing indebtedness that will be covered by the security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1516	It may for the same reason be necessary for the creditor to disclose the amount of new money that is being made available to the principal debtor and will be covered by the security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1517	The financial details to which I have referred would not , under the general law , have to be disclosed by a creditor to the would-be surety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1518	They are details that the creditor could expect the surety , as part of the surety 's risk assessment , to find out for himself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1519	But the surety wife cases present their own special problems , as was recognised in O'Brien . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1520	In the surety wife cases , and in any other cases in which a creditor is placed on inquiry as to whether the surety 's apparent consent to the transaction may have been procured by some impropriety of the principal debtor , the reasonable steps the creditor should take would generally include , in my opinion , disclosing to the surety the financial details to which I have referred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1521	Failure to do so would not matter , of course , if the surety already knew the details or if the creditor had reason to believe that the surety knew . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1522	I should , perhaps , add that the failure of a creditor to have disclosed these details should not , without more , be taken , in relation to past transactions , to show that the creditor had failed to take reasonable steps . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1523	190 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1524	The financial details to which I have referred would , if the creditor were a bank , normally be confidential . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1525	The bank would not be entitled to disclose them without the consent of its client , the principal debtor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1526	However , in the surety wife cases I would regard the husband 's proposal that the wife stand surety for his , or his company 's , debts as constituting an implied authority to the bank to disclose those details to the wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1527	Express instructions to the contrary , if given by the husband to the bank , would constitute a warning to the bank of an extra risk that the husband might be abusing his wife 's trust and confidence in him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1528	I think that the bank , before it could safely rely on the wife 's apparent consent to the suretyship , would then need to insist that she receive legal advice from a solicitor independent of her husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1529	Summary 191 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1530	My Lords I think , given the regrettable length of this opinion , I should try and summarise my views about the principles that apply and the practice that should be followed in surety wife cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1531	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1532	The issue as between the surety wife and the lender bank is whether the bank may rely on the apparent consent of the wife to the suretyship transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1533	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1534	If the bank knows that the surety wife 's consent to the transaction has been procured by undue influence or misrepresentation , or if it has shut its eyes to the likelihood that that was so , it may not rely on her apparent consent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1535	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1536	If the wife 's consent has in fact been procured by undue influence or misrepresentation , the bank may not rely on her apparent consent unless it has good reason to believe that she understands the nature and effect of the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1537	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1538	Unless the case has some special feature , the bank 's knowledge that a solicitor is acting for the wife and has advised her about the nature and effect of the transaction will provide a good reason for the purposes of 3 above . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1539	That will also be so if the bank has a reasonable belief that a solicitor is acting for her and has so advised her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1540	Written confirmation by a solicitor acting for the wife that he has so advised her will entitle the bank to hold that reasonable belief . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1541	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1542	So , too , a sufficient explanation of the nature and effect of the transaction given by a senior bank official would constitute good reason for the purposes of 3 above . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1543	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1544	If there are any facts known to the bank which increase the inherent risk that the wife 's consent to the transaction may have been procured by the husband 's undue influence or misrepresentation , it may be necessary for the bank to be satisfied that the wife has received advice about the transaction from a solicitor independent of the husband before the bank can reasonably rely on the wife 's apparent consent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1545	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1546	If the bank has not taken reasonable steps to satisfy itself that the wife understands the nature and effect of the transaction , the wife will , subject to such matters as delay , acquiescence , change of position etc. , be able to set aside the transaction if her consent was in fact procured by undue influence or misrepresentation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1547	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1548	Subject to special instructions or special circumstances , the duty of a solicitor instructed to act for a wife proposing to stand as surety , or to give security , for her husband 's debts is to try and make sure that she understands the nature and effect of the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1549	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1550	In all surety wife cases the bank should disclose to the surety wife , or to the solicitor acting for her , the amount of the existing indebtedness of the principal debtor to the bank and the amount of the proposed new loan or drawing facility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1551	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1552	Subject to 9 above , a creditor has no greater duty of disclosure to a surety wife than to any other intending surety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1553	192 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1554	I am in full agreement with the analysis of the applicable principles of law and with the conclusions expressed in the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead . 	lord scott	lord nicholls	fullagr	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1555	I believe the analysis I have sought to give in this opinion and my conclusions are consistent with them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls

154	1620	Mrs Etridge 's defence was that her signature to the charges had been procured by the undue influence of her husband , that the bank and the Ambetta trustees must be taken to have had constructive notice that that was so and that in consequence she was not bound by the charges .

154	1622	208 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1623	As well as defending the proceedings brought against her by the bank and the Ambetta trustees , Mrs Etridge sued Robert Gore & Co for negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls

154	1626	Judge Behrens held that even if there had been undue influence by Mr Etridge in procuring Mrs Etridge to agree to the grant of the two charges , notice of that impropriety could not be attributed either to the bank or to the Ambetta trustees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
154	1627	He held that both the bank and the Ambetta trustees had been entitled to rely on the confirmation , given by Mr Ellis by means of the endorsements on the charges , that Mrs Etridge had had the effect and contents of the charges explained to her -LRB- see p 19 of his judgment -RRB- .

154	1632	As to manifest disadvantage , he held that there was no manifest disadvantage to Mrs Etridge in the charge granted to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1633	This was because the liabilities secured by the charge included # 100,000 advanced by the bank to Mr Etridge to enable the purchase of The Old Rectory to be completed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls

154	1654	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1655	the manner which first Judge Behrens and then the Court of Appeal dealt with the presumption of undue influence and with the part to be played by manifest disadvantage demonstrates , in my opinion , the tangle that the case law in this area has got into . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1656	219 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1657	The presumption of undue influence , whether in a category 2A case , or in a category 2B case , is a rebuttable evidential presumption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1658	It is a presumption which arises if the nature of the relationship between two parties coupled with the nature of the transaction between them is such as justifies , in the absence of any other evidence , an inference that the transaction was procured by the undue influence of one party over the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1659	This evidential presumption shifts the onus to the dominant party and requires the dominant party , if he is to avoid a finding of undue influence , to adduce some sufficient additional evidence to rebut the presumption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1660	In a case where there has been a full trial , however , the judge must decide on the totality of the evidence before the court whether or not the allegation of undue influence has been proved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1661	In an appropriate case the presumption may carry the complainant home . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1662	But it makes no sense to find , on the one hand , that there was no undue influence but , on the other hand , that the presumption applies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1663	If the presumption does , after all the evidence has been heard , still apply , then a finding of undue influence is justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1664	If , on the other hand , the judge , having heard the evidence , concludes that there was no undue influence , the presumption stands rebutted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1665	A finding of actual undue influence and a finding that there is a presumption of undue influence are not alternatives to one another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1666	The presumption is , I repeat , an evidential presumption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1667	If it applies , and the evidence is not sufficient to rebut it , an allegation of undue influence succeeds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1668	220 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1669	As to manifest disadvantage , the expression is no more than shorthand for the proposition that the nature and ingredients of the impugned transaction are essential factors in deciding whether the evidential presumption has arisen and in determining the strength of that presumption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1670	It is not a divining-rod by means of which the presence of undue influence in the procuring of a transaction can be identified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1671	It is merely a description of a transaction which can not be explained by reference to the ordinary motives by which people are accustomed to act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1672	221 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1673	In the present case , the judge 's conclusion that there had been no actual undue influence was reached after considering all the evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1674	There was evidence of the relationship between Mr and Mrs Etridge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1675	Their relationship was , as one would expect of a married couple living together with the family income being provided by the husband 's business activities and with financial decisions affecting the family being taken by the husband , a relationship of trust and confidence by her in him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1676	But there was no evidence of abuse by Mr Etridge of that relationship , or of any bullying of Mrs Etridge in order to persuade her to support his decisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1677	Both the transactions under attack had been entered into in part in order to provide finance for the purchase of The Old Rectory and in part to obtain financial support for Mr Etridge in his business enterprises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1678	Both had elements disadvantageous to her and elements that were to her advantage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1679	To draw a distinction between the two charges as to inferences of undue influence that might be drawn was , in my opinion , unreal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1680	In my view , the judge 's conclusion that there had been no undue influence was well justified on the evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1681	That conclusion should have been an end of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1682	222 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1683	Before your Lordships Mr Mawrey QC , counsel for Mrs Etridge , argued that Mrs Etridge 's ignorance of the nature or contents of the documents she was signing and , in particular , her ignorance that she was charging The Old Rectory as a security for her husband 's debts , enabled her to contend that she had been induced to sign by her husband 's misrepresentation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1684	Mr Etridge had had a duty to explain to her the nature of the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1685	His failure to do so constituted a misrepresentation by silence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1686	223 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1687	Mr Mawrey told us that misrepresentation had always been part of Mrs Etridge 's case , and indeed it figures in her pleading . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1688	But there is no reference to it in Judge Behrens ' judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1689	He made no finding on misrepresentation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1690	Nor did the Court of Appeal comment on the point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1691	It is fair to conclude , therefore , that if the misrepresentation point was argued at all below , it could only have been very faintly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1692	This is not surprising for the point is not sustainable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1693	First , a misrepresentation must , if it is to lead to an equitable or legal remedy , have led to a false impression about some material matter being held by the victim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1694	In the present case Mrs Etridge had no impression at all as to the nature of the documents she was signing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1695	No false impression had been planted on her by Mr Etridge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1696	Mr Etridge 's silence did not lead her to form , or to continue to hold , any false impression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1697	She did not bother to read the documents that were placed before her for signature , and no one explained them to her , so she did not know what she was signing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1698	But she was not persuaded to sign by any misrepresentation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1699	Second , Judge Behrens found as a fact that if the nature and content of the documents had been explained to her , she would still have signed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1700	So , if there had been any misrepresentation as to the nature and content of the documents , it had no relevant causative effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1701	The misrepresentation contention is , in my opinion , for both these reasons a hopeless one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1702	224 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1703	There was , therefore , nothing , no undue influence and no misrepresentation , to which constructive notice could attach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1704	225 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1705	As to constructive notice , the bank was of course aware that Mrs Etridge was offering her property , The Old Rectory , to secure her husband 's indebtedness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1706	The bank was , therefore , on notice of a risk that her consent to grant the security might have been improperly obtained by her husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1707	The bank had no particular reason to suspect either undue influence or misrepresentation but the risk , attendant in every case where a wife is being asked to stand surety for her husband 's debts , was present . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1708	226 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1709	But Mrs Etridge was , to the knowledge of the bank , being advised by Robert Gore & Co , solicitors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1710	The solicitors confirmed to the bank , in the event falsely but the bank was not to know that that was so , that they had advised Mrs Etridge about the content and effect of the charge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1711	That confirmation , from the bank 's point of view , reduced the risk that Mrs Etridge 's consent to grant the charge might have been improperly obtained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1712	The possibility that there might have been some such impropriety could never be wholly eliminated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1713	But the fact that to the bank 's knowledge there were solicitors acting for Mrs Etridge , and the fact that they had told the bank that they had advised her about the content and effect of the charge , entitled the bank , in my opinion , to be satisfied that it was safe in relying on her apparent consent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1714	There were no further steps that the bank could reasonably have been required to take . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1715	227 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1716	Nor , in my opinion , can Robert Gore & Co 's knowledge that they had failed to give Mrs Etridge the requisite advice be imputed to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1717	The solicitors were not the bank 's agents for the purpose of advising Mrs Etridge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1718	228 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1719	In my opinion , therefore , Mrs Etridge 's appeal fails and should be dismissed . 	lord scott	self	outcome	0.7	lord nicholls

154	1764	But , as my noble and learned friend , Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough , has pointed out , her solicitor in these proceedings , Mr Holt of Evans Derry Binnion has stated in an affidavit of 28 May 1997 that `` insofar as my client is concerned Wragge & Co were not her solicitors '' -LRB- paragraph 6 -RRB- . 	lord scott	lord hobhouse	partagr	0.7	lord nicholls

154	1767	On 27 October 1988 , Mr Hamlett wrote to the bank a letter which said , among other things : `` I have explained to Mr & Mrs Harris in detail this morning the effect of the first charge over the property and of the unlimited personal guarantee . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1768	249 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1769	It appears , however , that Mr Hamlett 's 27 October letter may not have been received by the bank , or , after receipt , may have gone astray . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1770	On 29 June 1989 the bank wrote to him saying that they did not appear to have received from him the confirmation that they had asked for in their letter of 26 October 1988 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1771	240 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1772	In her defence and counterclaim , Mrs Harris pleaded that her agreement to sign the guarantee and the legal charge had been obtained `` in the premises '' by her husband 's undue influence , or , alternatively , that it was to be presumed that it had been so obtained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1773	She pleaded that the bank was , or should have been , aware that the transactions were manifestly disadvantageous to her and that the bank had actual or constructive notice of the undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1774	She pleaded that , in the circumstances , the guarantee and the legal charge were not binding on her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1775	241 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1776	As I have said , Mrs Harris ' defence and counterclaim were struck out by the deputy district judge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1777	She appealed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1778	Her appeal was heard by Judge Alton , in the Birmingham County Court , who dismissed the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1779	The judge identified two issues , namely : `` whether the bank was potentially on constructive notice of undue influence , presumed or actual by Mr Harris . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1780	Secondly , if so , whether it took reasonable steps to negative such notice . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1781	It was conceded , for the purpose of the strike-out application , that the relationship of trust and confidence between Mr Harris and Mrs Harris brought the case into category 2B where undue influence was to be presumed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1782	I doubt whether this concession was sound , for there was , I think , also a third issue that arose on the pleadings , namely , whether the facts and matters pleaded by Mrs Harris , `` the premises '' referred to in her defence and counterclaim , raised any presumption at all or could sustain any arguable case of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1783	I will return to this issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1784	242 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1785	On the first of the two issues she had identified , the judge concluded that Mrs Harris had pleaded an arguable case that the bank had had constructive notice of the presumed undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1786	But as to the second issue , she concluded that on the facts , either pleaded or not in dispute , the bank , in asking Wragge & Co to give appropriate advice to Mrs Harris , had taken reasonable steps to negative the constructive notice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1787	She held , also , that Wragge & Co were not the bank 's agents for any purpose other than to register the charge on the bank 's behalf . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1788	243 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1789	The Court of Appeal agreed with the judge on both the two issues , per Stuart Smith LJ : `` The solicitors were acting for Mrs Harris in the transaction and the bank were entitled to assume that they had given appropriate advice and were entitled to accept the solicitors ' letter as confirmation that this had been done .

154	1791	244 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1792	In my opinion , on the premise that the solicitors were indeed Mrs Harris ' solicitors , the Court of Appeal came to the correct conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1793	In reviewing their decision , however , I would start with the third issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1794	Was this a case in which , on Mrs Harris ' pleading , there was an arguable case of undue influence ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1795	The relationship of trust or confidence was certainly present . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1796	Mr Harris conducted the businesses from which the family income was derived . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1797	It was he who negotiated the financial arrangements with Barclays Bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1798	He did not explain the arrangements to his wife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1799	He simply asked her to sign the legal documentation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1800	But there is no pleaded allegation of misrepresentation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1801	His statement , express or implied , that he would be able to trade his way out of his financial difficulties may have been an expression of over optimism but can not be , and has not been , suggested to be a misrepresentation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1802	There was no allegation of any bullying of Mrs Harris or of any pressure on her to sign that could be characterized as excessive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1803	She signed , without knowing what she was signing , because she trusted him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1804	This pleaded story does not , in my opinion , raise any presumption of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1805	It does not , in the absence of any other evidence , justify an inference that Mr Harris brought undue influence to bear in order to persuade her to sign . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1806	Her agreement to do so is consistent with a normal , trusting , relationship between a married couple . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1807	Since , however , it was accepted below that , for striking-out purposes , Mrs Harris could rely on there being a presumption of undue influence , it would not be right to uphold the striking-out on this ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1808	The critical issue is the constructive notice issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1809	245 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1810	As to constructive notice , the bank knew that Mrs Harris was agreeing to become surety for the debts of her husband 's company , PCC . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1811	As in all such cases the bank was , or ought to have been , aware that there was a risk of misrepresentation or of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1812	On the pleaded facts , the extent of the risk was not , in my opinion , very great . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1813	There were no special features to put the bank on inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1814	But the bank did , in order to protect itself against that risk , have to take reasonable steps to satisfy itself that the nature and effect of the documents she was to sign were properly explained to Mrs Harris . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1815	246 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1816	The bank believed that Wragge & Co were acting not only for Mr Harris but also for Mrs Harris and would give Mrs Harris the requisite legal advice about the documents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1817	Mr Hamlett 's letter of 27 October , if the bank received it , would have confirmed that belief . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1818	But it does not appear that the bank 's belief was derived from anything said or done by Mrs Harris . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1819	And Mrs Harris contends that Mr Hamlett was not her solicitor and in any event gave her no explanation about the nature and effect of the documents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1820	If these contentions can be made good and if Mrs Harris does succeed in establishing undue influence it is at least arguable that she will succeed on the constructive notice issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1821	In my opinion , therefore , Mrs Harris ' case must be allowed to go to trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1822	I would allow her appeal . 	lord scott	self	outcome	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1823	247 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1824	There is a further complication to which I should refer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1825	Mrs Harris died on 22 March 2001 while the appeal to this House was pending . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1826	Her appeal abated in accordance with Standing Order X but a Petition for Reviver presented by Mr Harris , her executor , was granted as of course on 9 May 2001 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1827	In the hearing of the appeal before your Lordships no point was made as to any effect her death or Mr Harris ' executorship might have on the bank 's claim for possession of the Old Rectory or on the future course of the litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
154	1828	It may seem somewhat incongruous for Mr Harris to be relying on his own undue influence over his wife in order to defeat the bank 's possession claim , but any difficulties or problems must be sorted out at trial or by applications made at first instance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls

154	1880	The purpose of this loan was to enable the Northern Rock 's prior charge to be redeemed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1881	In March 1994 the bank commenced proceedings for recovery of the sums due in respect of the two loans and for possession of the flat and applied for summary judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1882	258 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1883	The question for the court was whether Mrs Wallace 's affidavit disclosed an arguable defence to the bank 's claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1884	Both before Lloyd J and before the Court of Appeal , and again before your Lordships , counsel for the bank conceded that Mrs Wallace had shown an arguable case of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1885	For my part , I would agree that Mrs Wallace 's affidavit , and in particular paragraph 11 , disclosed a sufficiently arguable case that in persuading her to sign the legal charge and in overriding her reluctance to do so Mr Wallace had abused the trust and confidence that she had in him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1886	Accordingly , the summary judgment application turned on the constructive notice issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1887	259 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1888	As to constructive notice , the bank knew that Mr and Mrs Wallace were a married couple living together in the jointly owned flat that was to be charged to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1889	The bank knew that the # 120,000 advance to Mr Wallace was to be used for his business purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1890	The bank knew that the proposed charge was an `` all monies '' charge which would secure any further advances that the bank might make to Mr Wallace . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1891	In these circumstances , in my opinion , the bank was on notice of the existence of a risk that Mrs Wallace 's consent to grant the charge might have been brought about by some impropriety , whether excessive pressure or misrepresentation , by Mr Wallace . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1892	The bank needed , therefore , to take reasonable steps to satisfy itself that Mrs Wallace was entering into the transaction `` freely and in knowledge of the true facts '' -LRB- see O'Brien -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 180 , 198 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1893	260 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1894	Lloyd J decided the constructive notice issue in favour of the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1895	He took the view that although Mr Samson , having accepted the instructions given him by the bank 's letter of 13 December 1988 , owed the bank a duty , that duty was to witness the signature of Mrs Wallace and to return to the bank the signed document , or , if she did not sign , the unsigned document . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1896	But the judge said `` It was not , I think , any part of his function to inform the bank as to what passed between him and her by way of advice or indeed communications on her part seeking advice . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1897	As to the endorsement that Mr Samson had written under Mrs Wallace 's signature , Lloyd J said that it `` carries with it a sufficient representation that he -LSB- ie Mr Samson -RSB- had given all necessary explanation and advice to her '' , and added : `` in this situation the risk of her not being properly advised is one which lies between her and Mr Samson and which can not be passed on to the bank .

154	1899	261 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1900	I would agree that if Mr Samson had indeed been acting as Mrs Wallace 's solicitor these conclusions and the reasons for them would have been unassailable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1901	But Mrs Wallace 's criticism of these conclusions has been based mainly on the proposition that Mr Samson was not her solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1902	She did not instruct him to give her any advice about the legal charge and he did not in fact give her any advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1903	Nor had the bank in its letter of 13 December 1988 asked Mr Samson to give her any advice about the legal charge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1904	It had simply asked him to `` attend to the necessary formalities for us '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1905	It is true , as the evidence stands , that Mrs Wallace never did instruct Mr Samson to give her advice and that he gave her none . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1906	It seems also to be true that Mr Samson never held himself out to Mrs Wallace as her solicitor with a duty to advise her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1907	On her evidence , he simply witnessed her signature . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1908	Whether she noticed the endorsement he wrote beneath her signature is not clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1909	In my opinion , for summary judgment purposes , your Lordships must proceed on the footing that Mr Samson was not Mrs Wallace 's solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1910	On whose behalf then was he acting ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1911	The answer must , in my opinion , be that he was acting on behalf of the bank from whom he received his instructions and to whom he submitted his fee note . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1912	262 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1913	The issue of constructive notice depends not on how Mr Samson 's role appeared to Mrs Wallace , but on how his role appeared to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls

154	1915	In that case the bank , on notice of the risk that Mrs Wallace 's consent to the legal charge might have been improperly obtained by undue influence or misrepresentation by her husband , would have taken no steps at all to satisfy itself that her consent to the legal charge had been given `` freely and in knowledge of the true facts '' -LRB- O'Brien , at p 198 -RRB- .

154	1961	Important evidence of what happened on this occasion was given by Mrs Gill and by Mr West and Mr Matthew . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1962	Mr Gill was not called to give evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1963	Where the evidence of Mrs Gill and that of Mr West and Mr Matthew conflicted , the Recorder preferred the evidence of the latter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1964	275 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1965	Mrs Gill gave evidence that there had been a heated altercation between herself and her husband when she discovered that she was being asked to sign a mortgage of the matrimonial home . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1966	She said that when the document was placed before her for signature she had asked what it was and that her husband had told her he needed her signature to be able to buy the garage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1967	She said he had told her that the bank was lending him # 36,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1968	She disputed Mr West 's evidence that he had explained the document to her and said that neither Mr West nor Mr Matthew , with whom she had a conversation in a separate room in the absence of her husband , had given her any explanation about the nature of the document that was offered for her signature . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1969	Nonetheless , the Recorder found that Mr Matthew did , while he was alone with her , give her `` a full and adequate explanation of the meaning of the document '' and expressed himself as being `` satisfied that Mrs Gill did receive proper and adequate advice '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1970	Mrs Gill told the Recorder that she had had no alternative but to sign . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1971	The Recorder did not accept that evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1972	He did find , on the contrary , that Mr Gill had spoken enthusiastically to her about the garage and its prospects and that she shared his enthusiasm . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1973	276 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1974	It was , however , clear that neither Mr West nor Mr Matthew had known that the amount the bank had agreed to advance was # 100,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1975	The amount secured by the legal charge was not expressed to be subject to any limit but the purchase price of Gresham Garage was only # 40,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1976	So it is believable that Mrs Gill was under the misapprehension that the bank loan was to be # 36,000 -LRB- # 4,000 having already been paid as a deposit -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1977	It is believable also that Mrs Gill had obtained this misapprehension from what her husband had told her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1978	The advice that , as the Recorder found , Mr West and Mr Matthew gave Mrs Gill did not go beyond explaining the nature and effect of the legal charge that she was being asked to sign . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1979	Neither was in a position to offer any advice about the commercial advantages or disadvantages of the purchase of the garage premises and business or about the wisdom of Mrs Gill agreeing to charge the matrimonial home with her husband 's indebtedness to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1980	277 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1981	Mr and Mrs Gill signed the legal charge on 20 February at Matthew & Matthew 's offices and the solicitors then wrote to the bank in the following terms : `` We confirm that the mortgage documentation supplied has been executed by Mr and Mrs Gill in accordance with your requirements , and we confirm that Mrs Gill was separately advised . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1982	On this evidence Mr Recorder Paulusz , although he held that the case was one in which there was a presumption of undue influence , rejected the contention that the bank should be taken to have had constructive notice of the undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1983	The Court of Appeal agreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1984	278 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1985	On the constructive notice point , I am in agreement with the Recorder and the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1986	The case was one in which the natural trust and confidence that the bank would have expected Mrs Gill to have , and that she did in fact have , in her husband , coupled with the nature of the transaction , namely , a charge over her property as security for his debts , raised the risk that her consent to the transaction might have been obtained by undue influence or misrepresentation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1987	But the confirmation to the bank , that before signing the legal charge Mrs Gill had been separately advised by solicitors , as indeed she had been , and , by implication , that the advice had related to the nature and effect of the legal charge , entitled the bank to be satisfied that it could safely rely on her apparent consent to the transaction as being a true consent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1988	279 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1989	There is some basis in the evidence for thinking that Mrs Gill may have been induced to sign by her husband 's misrepresentation that the loan agreed to be made by the bank was only # 36,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1990	It does not appear , however , that any weight at the trial or in the Court of Appeal was sought to be placed on this misrepresentation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1991	The emphasis seems to have been all on undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1992	Whatever may have been the reason for this , it can not , in my opinion , affect the conclusion on the constructive notice issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1993	The legal charge secured Mr Gill 's indebtedness to the bank whatever the amount of the indebtedness might be . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1994	Matthew & Matthew 's confirmation to the bank that Mrs Gill had received separate advice was an implicit confirmation that she had been advised about the meaning and effect of the document - as , indeed , the Recorder found she had . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1995	That advice would have included advice that the amount of the current loan might in the future be increased . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1996	280 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1997	I have earlier in this opinion expressed the view that in all cases the lender bank should inform the surety wife , or her solicitors , of the amount of the agreed facility and of any existing indebtedness that would be secured under the proposed charge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1998	If that had been done in the present case , it would have guarded Mrs Gill against a misapprehension about the amount of the agreed loan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	1999	But in the circumstances of this case , and in particular in view of the fact that no limit on the amount of the secured liability was expressed in the legal charge , the fact that the bank did not disclose this information does not , in my opinion , constitute a failure by the bank to take reasonable steps to satisfy itself that Mrs Gill 's consent had not been improperly procured . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2000	281 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2001	Finally , a comment on undue influence is prompted by the facts of this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2002	The Recorder held that although there was no actual undue influence , there was a presumption of undue influence since the case fell within category 2B . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2003	The Court of Appeal recorded these findings without comment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2004	In my opinion , these findings disclose the same error to which I have referred previously in this opinion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2005	By the end of the trial the Recorder , having heard all the evidence , had to decide whether or not undue influence had been established . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2006	Either the evidence did justify a finding of undue influence or it did not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2007	On the evidence in the case a finding of undue influence would , in my opinion , have been unthinkable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2008	Mrs Gill had been enthusiastic about the purchase of Gresham Garage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2009	She knew she was signing a legal charge under which her home became security for her husband 's debts to the bank incurred in acquiring the premises and business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2010	She had been separately advised by a solicitor about the nature and effect of the document she was to sign . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2011	The highest her case can be put is that she would have liked more time to consider whether or not to sign . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2012	She said in evidence : `` I did sign the documents put in front of me but with time for more reflection , and in less urgent circumstances , with proper advice to think about it , and time to consult a solicitor of my own , I would never have done so . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2013	This is a quite inadequate basis , in my opinion , for a finding of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2014	I do not think this was a case in which there was ever any evidence giving rise to the presumption of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2015	But , if there was , by the end of the trial the presumption had been rebutted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls

NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2022	In 1995 , after the bank 's demand for payment of the outstanding debt had not been met , the bank commenced proceedings for , among other things , possession of the property with a view to its sale . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2023	Mrs Coleman defended the proceedings by alleging that she had consented to the legal charge under the undue influence of her husband and that the bank had had constructive notice of that impropriety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2024	The trial judge , Judge Wakefield , took the view that the legal charge was not to the manifest disadvantage of Mrs Coleman , that there was no presumption of undue influence and that undue influence had not been established . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2025	He expressed the view , also , that the bank had not taken reasonable steps to avoid constructive notice if there had been any undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2026	The Court of Appeal disagreed with the judge on both points , and therefore concurred with the judge in the result . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2027	First , the court held that the transaction was to Mrs Coleman 's material disadvantage and that , in the circumstances , undue influence was to be presumed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2028	But they held , secondly , that constructive notice should not be imputed to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2029	Before your Lordships Mr Jarvis QC , for the bank , has not argued against the Court of Appeal 's conclusion on the undue influence issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2030	He accepts that if the bank had constructive notice that Mrs Coleman 's consent may have been improperly obtained , her appeal is entitled to succeed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls

154	2032	The relationship between Mr Coleman and Mrs Coleman is of significance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2033	They are Hassidic Jews . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2034	Mrs Coleman 's upbringing and education in a Hassidic community in the United States prepared her to expect and to accept a position of subservience and obedience to the wishes of her husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2035	The judge put it thus , at p 24 of his judgment : `` The upbringing and education of Mrs Coleman prepared her principally for marriage within her own religious community and for a life of subservience to the wishes of her husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2036	I do not mean this in any derogatory sense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2037	Hers may well have been a happy state , but it was one in which her husband 's wishes and judgment in matters of finance and business were to be followed without question . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2038	So it seems that the trust and confidence of a wife in her husband , which , notably in relation to family finances and family business matters , is a feature of very many marriages , is accentuated in a Hassidic marriage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls

154	2080	Notwithstanding Mr Jarvis ' concession to which I have already referred , I should , I think , make one or two comments about the undue influence issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2081	First , I agree that this was a case in which the relationship between Mr Coleman and Mrs Coleman , in the cultural context of the Hassidic community of which they formed a part , raised a serious question whether Mrs Coleman 's consent to the granting of the legal charge was a true consent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2082	She gave evidence that if she had had the content and effect of the legal charge explained to her , she might have declined to sign it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2083	I doubt this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2084	The thrust of her evidence as to her relationship with her husband was that she was bound to defer to him in the judgment of what should or should not be done about family finances or with family assets . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2085	It is not consistent with that evidence to suppose that a better understanding of the nature and effect of the legal charge would have brought her to refuse to comply with her husband 's request that she sign . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2086	291 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2087	I think the Court of Appeal was quite right in regarding this as a case in which there was a presumption of undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2088	But the presumption was not , in my opinion , attributable to the `` manifest disadvantage '' to Mrs Coleman of the legal charge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2089	The legal charge , supporting her husband 's business ventures on which he engaged in order to support his family , was no more disadvantageous to her than any transaction in which a wife agrees to become surety in order to support her husband 's commercial activities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2090	The presumption arose , in my opinion , out of their relationship , in which Mrs Coleman was not merely disinclined to second-guess her husband on matters of business , but appears to have regarded herself as obliged not to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2091	In such a case , in my opinion , the rebuttal of the presumption would have needed legal advice from someone independent of the husband who could have impressed upon her that she should not sign unless she truly wanted to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2092	In the circumstances , I agree with the Court of Appeal that a presumption , or inference , of undue influence arose and was not rebutted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2093	292 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2094	But in considering the issue of constructive notice , the question is not how the case appeared to Mrs Coleman , or to the person purporting to have given her the legal advice ; it is how the case appeared to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2095	There was no evidence to show that the bank had knowledge of any greater risk of undue influence than might be present in any case in which a wife was apparently agreeing to become surety , or give security , for her husband 's business debts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2096	It would reasonably have appeared to the bank , from the typed endorsement on the legal charge , that Mrs Coleman had received advice from a legally qualified person acting for her , so as to enable her to understand the contents and effect of the document she was signing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2097	The fact that the advice had been given by a legal executive and not by a qualified solicitor is not , in my opinion , material . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2098	An experienced legal executive in a firm with a conveyancing practice is well able to give full and adequate advice as to the contents and effect of a straightforward legal charge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2099	The bank were entitled to believe that Reuben Gale & Co would not entrust such a task to a legal executive with insufficient experience to carry out the task properly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2100	The bank had no reason to think that any special precautions needed to be taken in Mrs Coleman 's case than would be requisite in any other case of a wife giving security for her husband 's debts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2101	In my opinion , the bank , having read the endorsement on the legal charge , was entitled to hold the reasonable belief that Mrs Coleman 's consent to the granting of the legal charge had not been improperly obtained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2102	There were no other steps that the bank could reasonably be required to have taken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2103	Constructive notice of Mr Coleman 's undue influence can not , in my opinion , be imputed to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2104	293 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
154	2105	I would , therefore , dismiss Mrs Coleman 's appeal . 	lord scott	self	outcome	0.8	lord nicholls

154	2117	In 1988 Mr Moore was seeking additional finance for the company and for that purpose enlisted the services of a Mr Zerfahs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls

154	2120	At the insistence of Mr Moore , and induced by his representations that the proposed mortgage transaction related to a `` risk free '' loan to the company , Mrs Moore signed in blank a mortgage application form . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls

154	2136	Mr Zerfahs had no authority from Mrs Moore to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls

154	2140	Mrs Moore 's case is that she never saw any such letter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls

154	2145	So , in a letter dated 5 May 1989 , UCB asked Quiney & Harris to act for UCB in arranging for the legal charge to be executed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2146	UCB did not ask the solicitors to give any advice to Mrs Moore . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls

154	2157	Mrs Moore 's defence alleged that her signature to the mortgage application form and her consent to the grant of the legal charge to UCB had been obtained by the undue influence of and misrepresentations made by Mr Moore . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2158	She gave further and better particulars of these allegations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2159	UCB applied , on 30 May 1996 , to strike-out those parts of the defence that resisted a possession order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2160	304 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2161	UCB contended that even if there had been undue influence or misrepresentation they had had no notice of it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2162	The district judge dismissed the strike-out application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2163	UCB appealed and Judge Holden allowed the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2164	He accepted , for the purposes of the strike-out , that Quiney & Harris had never been instructed by Mrs Moore and had given her no advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2165	He said : `` For the purposes of the appeal before me I must accept -LSB- Mrs Moore 's -RSB- version of the facts and assume that there was undue influence and that she received no advice from the solicitors and did not instruct them . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2166	But he accepted UCB 's case that they had had the reasonable belief , via the mortgage application form signed by Mrs Moore , that Quiney & Harris were acting for her and would give her whatever advice she needed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2167	He said : '' -LSB- UCB -RSB- reasonably believed that -LSB- Mr and Mrs Moore -RSB- had their own solicitors who were dealing with the transaction and it was quite reasonable for them to assume that in carrying out that function those solicitors would give proper advice to -LSB- Mrs Moore -RSB- . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2168	In effect , he held that constructive notice of Mr Moore 's undue influence or misrepresentation could not be imputed to UCB . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2169	305 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2170	The Court of Appeal agreed with Judge Holden that Quiney & Harris ' knowledge that they had given Mrs Moore no advice about or explanation of the legal charge could not be imputed to UCB . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2171	They agreed that there was nothing , in the circumstances , to put UCB on enquiry : per Stuart-Smith LJ -LSB- 1998 -RSB- 4 All ER 705 , 731 : `` It was not necessary for -LSB- UCB -RSB- to give instructions to the solicitors to do what was already their duty ; nor was it necessary to require certification that that has been done . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2172	306 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2173	I have some sympathy with these conclusions but I do not think they could safely be reached on the striking out application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2174	UCB knew that Mrs Moore was offering her share in the matrimonial home , Pangbourne Lodge , as security for the # 300,000 loan to the company . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2175	But over two-thirds of the loan was to be applied in discharging existing indebtedness charged on Pangbourne Lodge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2176	The balance was to go to the company in whose business Mrs Moore , as well as Mr Moore , played a part . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2177	UCB was , or should have been , aware of a risk that Mrs Moore 's apparent consent might be tainted by undue influence or misrepresentation , but the risk would not have appeared to be a very great one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2178	And the information that Mr and Mrs Moore had solicitors acting for them reduced the risk . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2179	It is not to the point that Mrs Moore had never instructed Quiney & Harris . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2180	UCB were not to know that that was so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2181	They had been misled by the contents of the mortgage application form that Mrs Moore had signed in blank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2182	It would be possible to argue that Mrs Moore , by signing in blank , had given an implied authority to her husband , or to his agent Mr Zerfahs , to complete the form on her behalf . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2183	It is enough , however , to conclude that UCB were entitled to take the mortgage application at its face value . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2184	307 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2185	But the problem is that UCB did not know what Quiney & Harris ' instructions were and had no reason to assume that their instructions extended to giving Mrs Moore advice about the nature and effect of the legal charge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2186	The instructions may have been no more than to agree the form of the security documents and make arrangements for them to be executed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2187	Quiney & Harris gave UCB no indication that they had given Mrs Moore any such advice and in fact they had not done so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2188	In my opinion , therefore , on the evidence as it now stands UCB failed to take reasonable steps to satisfy itself that Mrs Moore understood the nature and effect of the legal charge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2189	308 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2190	Mr Sher QC , counsel for Mrs Moore , suggested that UCB should have been put on enquiry by the apparent alteration to the stated amount of Mr Moore 's annual income . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2191	This , to my mind , is very much an after-the-event point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2192	If there had been some other reason to question the genuineness of the mortgage application , the alteration of the annual amount would , I agree , have added to the suspicion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls

154	2220	The deputy judge went on to consider , as an alternative to actual undue influence , Mrs Bennett 's case based on presumed undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2221	He held that both the guarantee and the legal charge were manifestly disadvantageous to Mrs Bennett and that the relationship between her and her husband was one of sufficient trust and confidence to raise a presumption of undue influence in relation to both transactions -LRB- -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 1 FLR 801 , 828-830 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2222	He held that the presumption had not been rebutted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2223	314 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2224	On this aspect of the case , Chadwick LJ commented , at -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 1 FLR 1115 , 1135 , on the paradox that Mrs Bennett was contending , on the one hand , that she had signed the two documents because her will to resist had been overborne by her husband but , on the other hand , that her trust and confidence in her husband was such that if he asked her to sign she would do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2225	The point is the same as that to which I have referred in Coleman -LRB- see para 290 above -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2226	315 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2227	The discussion about the presumption of undue influence was unnecessary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2228	Once actual undue influence has been found at trial , the question whether , if the evidence had been confined to the relationship between the parties and the nature of the impugned transaction , undue influence would have been presumed and , if it would , whether it had been rebutted , becomes irrelevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2229	And if , after a full trial , the judge concludes that undue influence has not been established , that conclusion means either that there never was a presumption of undue influence or , if there was , that it has been rebutted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2230	316 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2231	The deputy judge 's and the Court of Appeal 's conclusions on the undue influence issue had the result that the outcome of the case appeared to depend on the constructive notice issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2232	It was accepted that the bank had had no actual notice of the undue influence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2233	Should constructive notice be imputed to the bank ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2234	The deputy judge , after considering the facts of the case , concluded that the bank had been put on enquiry as to the circumstances in which Mrs Bennett had agreed to sign the guarantee and the legal charge and had failed to take reasonable steps `` to satisfy itself that Mrs Bennett 's agreement was properly obtained '' -LRB- -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 1 FLR 801 , 807 -RRB- .

154	2237	Chadwick LJ said : `` I am satisfied that the bank was entitled to take the view , on the totality of the facts known to it , that there was no real risk that Mrs Bennett 's apparent consent to the transaction and , in particular , to the charge -- had been obtained by improper conduct on the part of her husband .

154	2292	The purpose of the charge was to secure the liabilities of Mr and Mrs Bennett under the guarantee , which Mr Parkyn had not seen and knew nothing about . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls

154	2296	Presumably Mr Parkyn had been sent these documents by the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls

154	2307	On 1 October 1991 , Dickinson Manser & Co wrote to the bank as follows : `` We write to advise you that completion took place on 1 October 1991 , and your instructions have been complied with Except as noted below , there is no matter not already disclosed to you which we should draw to your attention in connection with this matter .

154	2309	333 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2310	This letter of 1 October 1991 , read in the context of the bank 's letter of 8 August 1991 -LRB- referred to in para 324 above -RRB- , entitled the bank to suppose that Dickinson Manser & Co had advised Mrs Bennett on the nature and effect of the legal charge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2311	334 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2312	After completion of the legal charge the bank allowed the company to draw down on the # 380,000 overdraft facility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2313	335 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2314	It is , in my opinion , important to emphasise that there was no evidence that Mr Parkyn knew about the guarantee that Mr and Mrs Bennett had signed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2315	Nor , therefore , was there any reason for him to be aware that the second charge of 15 , Elthiron Road was securing their liabilities as guarantors of the company 's debts to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2316	The evidence justifies the inference that he thought they were principal debtors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2317	Nor was there any evidence that Mr Parkyn knew anything about the charges that the company had given to the bank and to SWIFT respectively , securing the liabilities of the company to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2318	And , in particular , there was no evidence that either Mr Parkyn , or Mrs Bennett , knew about the ranking agreement under which SWIFT 's charge was to rank ahead of the bank 's charges for an amount not exceeding # 250,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2319	336 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2320	About seven months before taking the second charge over 15 , Elthiron Road , the bank had received a valuation of the company 's factory premises with the proposed new factory built thereon . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2321	The valuation was well below the likely construction costs that the company would incur in building the new factory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2322	The bank did not disclose this information to Mrs Bennett or to Mr Parkyn and there is no reason to suppose that either of them was aware of it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2323	337 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2324	The bank had taken no steps at all to satisfy itself that Mrs Bennett 's consent to giving the guarantee had been properly obtained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2325	So the judge concluded that constructive notice of Mr Bennett 's undue influence in procuring her consent to the guarantee should be imputed to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2326	He held that she was not bound by the guarantee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2327	338 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2328	The bank did not appeal against this conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2329	The reason the bank did not do so was that Mr Bennett remained bound by the guarantee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2330	The legal charge secured his liabilities to the bank as well as those of Mrs Bennett . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2331	So if the bank could uphold the legal charge against Mrs Bennett , the company 's debts for which Mr Bennett was liable under the guarantee would be secured by the legal charge whether or not Mrs Bennett was bound by the guarantee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2332	339 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2333	As to the question whether the bank had constructive notice of Mr Bennett 's undue influence in procuring Mrs Bennett to consent to the legal charge , the deputy judge would , but for the bank 's omission to disclose to Mr Parkyn , or to Mrs Bennett , the existence of the ranking agreement or the valuation of the company 's factory premises , have regarded the bank as protected by its reasonable belief that Mrs Bennett had received appropriate legal advice about the nature and effect of the legal charge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2334	He cited passages from the judgments in Massey v Midland Bank Plc -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 1 All ER 929 , Barclays Bank Plc v Thomson -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 4 All ER 816 , Banco Exterior Internacional v Mann -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 1 All ER 936 and Midland Bank Plc v Serter -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 1 FLR 1034 and concluded , correctly in my opinion , that the fact that Dickinson , Manser & Co had been acting not only for Mrs Bennett but also for Mr Bennett and for the bank itself did not detract from the reasonableness of the bank 's expectation that the solicitors would have given Mrs Bennett adequate advice about the legal charge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2335	He said -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 1 FLR 801 , 834 : `` A bank is in no worse position merely because , to its knowledge , the solicitor is acting both for the prospective surety and for the debtor . '' and , at p 835 : `` Unless a bank is put on notice by other matters within its knowledge that the solicitors have not performed their duty to give independent advice to the surety it is as much entitled -LSB- where the solicitor is acting also for the creditor -RSB- as in any other case to assume that the solicitors have been acting properly . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls

154	2337	340 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2338	But the judge accepted , at p 840 , the submission made by counsel for Mrs Bennett that because the bank had failed to disclose to Mr Parkyn , or to Mrs Bennett , the ranking agreement between the bank and SWIFT and had failed to disclose the disparity between the development cost and the ultimate value of the factory premises , the bank had failed `` to show that it took reasonable steps to bring home to Mrs Bennett the risks she was running '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2339	341 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2340	The judge treated the non-disclosure as a constructive notice point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2341	His reasoning , I think , proceeded in this way : 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2342	The bank 's knowledge of the relationship between Mr and Mrs Bennett and of the nature of the transactions she was entering into , ie the guarantee and the legal charge , put the bank on notice of the risk that her agreement to the transactions might have been procured by the undue influence of her husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2343	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2344	The bank could avoid being on constructive notice of any such impropriety by taking reasonable steps to satisfy itself that Mrs Bennett understood the nature and effect of the transactions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2345	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2346	The bank 's failure to disclose the material facts regarding the SWIFT ranking agreement and the value of the factory premises was a failure to take reasonable steps . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2347	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2348	It was a failure to take reasonable steps because unless Mr Parkyn was given this information he could not be expected to give Mrs Bennett appropriate advice about the risks she was running . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls

154	2352	but held , at pp 1142-1143 : `` the judge was wrong to hold that the bank was required to bring those facts to the notice of Mr Parkyn or his client : or ... to hold that ... the bank was not entitled to assume that Mr Parkyn would become aware of those facts in the course of considering what advice he needed to give Mrs Bennett .

NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls

154	2361	He probably would have asked her if she knew anything about the company 's existing indebtedness to the bank and the extent of its overdraft facility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2362	If she did not know these things , he might have advised her to find out about them or have asked her if she wanted him to try and do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2363	But it seems to me highly unlikely that he would on his own initiative have examined the company 's latest balance sheet -- which would probably have been well out of date -- or have inquired into the balance sheet values of its assets . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2364	I think it highly unlikely that , without special instructions to do so , he would have carried out a search in order to discover what charges were registered against the company . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2365	In the ordinary discharge of his duties as a solicitor advising Mrs Bennett about the nature and effect of the legal charge I do not believe he would have become aware either of the ranking agreement between the bank and SWIFT or of the valuation of the factory premises that the bank had obtained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2366	345 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2367	In my opinion , however , both the deputy judge and the Court of Appeal approached this question of disclosure from the wrong angle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2368	The point was not , in my view , a constructive notice point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2369	It was simply a disclosure point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2370	Did the bank have an obligation to the proposed surety to disclose this information to the surety ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2371	If it did , what is the consequence of the non-disclosure ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2372	346 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2373	In my opinion , the ranking agreement between the company , the bank and SWIFT falls within the general proposition expressed by Vaughan Williams LJ in London General Omnibus Co Ltd v Holloway -LSB- 1912 -RSB- 2 KB 72 , 79 -LRB- see para 186 above -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2374	A surety who pays off the creditor is entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the creditor in respect of the debt in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2375	And if the creditor , in order to discharge the debt , has recourse to security provided by the surety , the same applies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2376	So , in the present case , if Mrs Bennett had paid the bank the # 150,000 , or if the bank had obtained payment by realising its security over 15 , Elthiron Road , Mrs Bennett would have been entitled to the benefit of the Bank 's rights against the company in respect of the # 150,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2377	These rights would have included the bank 's rights under its fixed and floating charges . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2378	But those rights were subject to the ranking agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2379	347 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2380	Moreover the ranking agreement reduced the amount of the company 's assets that would be available for the payment of the company 's debts to the bank and correspondingly increased the likelihood that the bank would make a call on Mr Bennett or Mrs Bennett , or both , under the guarantee and would enforce its security over 15 , Elthiron Road . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
154	2381	The ranking agreement did affect the rights of Mrs Bennett as surety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2382	348 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2383	In my opinion , the bank ought to have disclosed to Mrs Bennett , or to the solicitor acting for her , the existence of the ranking agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2384	349 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2385	The deputy judge thought that the facts regarding the valuation of the factory premises should also have been disclosed by the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2386	Here , I do not agree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2387	It is , I think , up to an intending surety to satisfy himself about the value of the principal debtor 's assets or the principal debtor 's credit worthiness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2388	350 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2389	The bank 's obligation to disclose the existence of the ranking agreement arose , in my opinion , under the general law applicable to suretyship contracts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2390	Mr Jarvis QC , counsel for the bank , accepted that if the bank had an obligation to disclose the ranking agreement and if Mrs Bennett and Mr Parkyn were on 1 October 1991 unaware of it , Mrs Bennett was entitled to have the legal charge set aside . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2391	351 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls

154	2395	The solicitors , appellants before your Lordships , are Desmond Banks & Co. . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2396	The proprietor of the firm , Mr Desmond Banks , acted in the matters that have given rise to this litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2397	353 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2398	Mrs Kenyon-Brown , the respondent before the House , contends that Mr Banks acted negligently in failing to advise her properly on 12 January 1993 , when she and her husband attended at his offices to sign a second legal charge of their jointly owned holiday cottage , Rock Cottage , Melplash , Bridport , to National Westminster Bank Plc. . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2399	The charge secured Mr Kenyon-Brown 's indebtedness to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2400	354 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2401	In her statement of claim Mrs Kenyon-Brown pleaded that Mr Banks owed her a duty to advise her , before she signed the legal charge , '' -LRB- i -RRB- that there was a conflict of interest between the plaintiff and Mr Kenyon-Brown in respect of the proposed mortgage ; and/or -LRB- ii -RRB- that the said conflict might prevent or inhibit the defendants from disclosing or explaining all aspects of the transaction to the plaintiff or from giving advice to the plaintiff which would conflict with Mr Kenyon-Brown 's interests ; and/or -LRB- iii -RRB- that she could and/or should obtain advice from an independent solicitor in respect of the proposed mortgage ; and/or -LRB- iv -RRB- that the proposed mortgage would confer no benefit upon her ; and/or -LRB- v -RRB- as to the nature and effect of the mortgage . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2402	She pleaded that Mr Banks had failed to give her advice in respect of these matters , or any advice about the proposed mortgage , and that in consequence she had suffered loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2403	355 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2404	She quantified her loss as being one half of the sum of # 55,000 then owing by Mr Kenyon-Brown to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2405	356 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2406	Mr Banks accepted in his defence that he had owed Mrs Kenyon-Brown a duty to advise her `` as to the meaning and effect '' of the legal charge , but denied any breach of duty and denied , if there had been any breach of duty , that the breach had caused any loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2407	Directions were given for issues of liability to be tried before issues of damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls

154	2412	The material facts can be quite shortly stated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2413	Mr and Mrs Kenyon-Brown were directors of and shareholders in KB Insurance Brokers -LRB- London -RRB- Ltd -LRB- KB -RRB- and PM Insurance Services Ltd -LRB- PM -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2414	These companies were controlled by Mr Kenyon-Brown but Mrs Kenyon-Brown did play some part in the insurance businesses that they carried on . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2415	358 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2416	In 1983 a controlling interest in each company was sold to Crusader Insurance Company Ltd -LRB- Crusader -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2417	359 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2418	In 1986 Mr and Mrs Kenyon-Brown purchased Rock Cottage for # 50,000 with the aid of a # 30,000 advance from Nationwide Building Society secured by a mortgage of Rock Cottage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls

154	2426	In 1989 the opportunity to repurchase from Crusader the shares in KB and PM arose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2427	As the deputy judge , Mr Peter Leaver QC , found : `` Mrs Kenyon-Brown was very much against doing so , but was overborne by her husband and very reluctantly agreed to the repurchase . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2428	363 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2429	Finance was needed for the repurchase of the shares and a loan from National Westminster Bank Plc to be secured by a second mortgage of 53 , Dene Road was arranged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2430	The loan was to be a loan to Mr Kenyon-Brown alone , not to the two of them jointly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2431	364 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2432	Mr Banks , who had acted for Mr and Mrs Kenyon-Brown in their purchase of 53 , Dene Road , and had acted previously for KB and for PM , acted for them in connection with the grant to the bank of the second mortgage of 53 , Dene Road . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2433	365 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2434	By a letter of 13 November 1989 the bank asked Mr Banks to arrange for the legal charge to be signed by Mr and Mrs Kenyon-Brown and to confirm , when returning the signed document , that Mrs Kenyon-Brown had received legal advice about it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2435	So Mr Banks arranged a meeting with her at his offices on 15 November 1989 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls

154	2438	Mr Banks pointed out to her that the advance was to be to Mr Kenyon-Brown alone , not to the two of them jointly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2439	Mrs Kenyon-Brown responded that she trusted her husband . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2440	Mr Banks was instrumental in arranging for the sum secured by the legal charge to be limited to # 150,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2441	No allegation has been made that in advising Mrs Kenyon-Brown on this occasion Mr Banks was in breach of the duty he owed her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2442	367 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2443	The legal charge over 53 , Dene Road was duly completed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2444	It secured the liabilities to the bank of Mr Kenyon-Brown , subject to the agreed limit of # 150,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2445	368 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2446	By 1992 , the bank was seeking further security in respect of Mr Kenyon-Brown 's indebtedness and agreement was apparently reached between it and Mr Kenyon-Brown that it would be given a second charge over Rock Cottage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2447	By a letter of 15 December 1992 the bank sent Mr Banks the proposed form of legal charge for signature by Mr and Mrs Kenyon-Brown . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2448	The letter said : `` We shall be grateful if you will confirm that Legal Advice was given to Mrs Kenyon-Brown when the charge form is returned . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2449	369 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls

154	2456	370 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2457	As indicated by the attendance note , the form of legal charge contained no limit on the amount of Mr Kenyon-Brown 's liabilities to the bank that would be secured . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2458	371 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2459	The legal charge was duly completed and dated 12 January 1993 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2460	372 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2461	At the trial , Mrs Kenyon-Brown was the only witness who gave oral evidence but the deputy judge said that he did not find her evidence about the events of 15 November 1989 or 12 January 1993 persuasive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2462	He said : `` Ultimately , I came to the conclusion that her evidence could not be relied upon . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2463	He recorded , however , that she said that she could not contradict Mr Banks ' attendance note of the 12 January 1993 meeting . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2464	He expressed his conclusions in the following passage : `` In my judgment the evidence in the present case comes nowhere near proving that the defendant was negligent in the manner of which Mrs Kenyon-Brown complains . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2465	It is for Mrs Kenyon-Brown to satisfy me , on the balance of probabilities , that the defendant failed to discharge his duty to her properly in the ways of which she complains . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2466	Mrs Kenyon-Brown has failed to satisfy me that the defendant gave no advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2467	Indeed the attendance note . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2468	makes it plain that the defendant did give advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2469	On Miss Smith 's second submission , that the defendant should , in the light of the conflict of interests , have told her to go to another solicitor , I hold that the law does not require that she -LSB- sic -RSB- should do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2470	While it may , in some cases be prudent for a solicitor so to advise , it will depend upon the facts of the case as to whether it was negligent or not to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2471	Although Mrs Kenyon-Brown told me that she was sure that if she had been advised to go to another solicitor she would have gone , I could not accept that evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2472	I form the view that Mrs Kenyon-Brown was quite clear as to what she was doing by entering into the second mortgage , and wanted to do so notwithstanding the defendant 's ` warning ' . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2473	373 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2474	These conclusions might be thought to have made the prospects of an appeal unpromising . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2475	But there was an appeal and the appeal succeeded -LRB- although Wilson J dissented -RRB- -LSB- 2000 -RSB- PNLR 266 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2476	The main judgment was given by Mance LJ . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2477	He based his reasoning substantially on the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Etridge -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 1998 -RSB- 4 All ER 705 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2478	He cited paragraphs 19 to 26 of Stuart-Smith LJ 's judgment under the heading `` Independent legal advice '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2479	In these paragraphs Stuart-Smith LJ was considering the advice that needs to be given where a solicitor is instructed to advise a person who may be subject to the undue influence of another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2480	I have criticised the contents of these paragraphs in an earlier section of this opinion and shall not repeat the criticism here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2481	The duty of a solicitor always depends on the extent of the instructions given to and accepted by him , either expressly or by implication , by conduct or otherwise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2482	The normal duty of a solicitor instructed to advise a would-be surety , whether a wife of the principal debtor or anyone else , about the document or documents the surety is being asked to sign , is to explain the nature and effect of the document in order to try and make sure that the surety knows what he or she is doing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2483	The particular circumstances of a particular case may add to or reduce the extent of the duty owed by the solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2484	There was , in my opinion , nothing in the circumstances which resulted in Mr Banks advising Mrs Kenyon-Brown about the proposed second mortgage of Rock Cottage to add to the normal duty that I have described . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2485	Mance LJ said that since Mr Banks knew that Mrs Kenyon-Brown reposed trust and confidence in her husband -LRB- see the contents of the attendance note of the 15 November 1989 meeting -RRB- and that the second mortgage of Rock Cottage appeared to be entirely in Mr Kenyon-Brown 's interests and was without limit of amount , he was on notice that `` there might be undue influence '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2486	This is something that was never pleaded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2487	It may be right that a solicitor who is advising a client about a transaction and has reason to suspect that the client is the victim of undue influence is placed under a duty to the client to try and protect her -LRB- see Bank of Montreal v Stuart -LSB- 1911 -RSB- AC 120 , 138 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2488	But if a case of that sort is to be advanced against a solicitor , it must be pleaded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2489	A solicitor does not have reason to suspect undue influence simply because he knows a wife has trust and confidence in her husband and is proposing to give a charge over her property to support his financial position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2490	That she is willing to do so is consistent with a normal relationship between spouses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2491	Mance LJ said , at p 281 : `` There is no suggestion , or likelihood in the light of Mr Banks ' attendance note , that Mr Banks ascertained the amount outstanding -LRB- well in excess of the limit of liability in the second mortgage of 53 , Dene Road -RRB- , its origin and the circumstances in which it came to be outstanding , let alone the prospects of its repayment or of the additional security over Rock Cottage being called upon . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2492	Nor did he ask why Mrs Kenyon-Brown was willing to grant such additional security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2493	Still less , therefore , did he know that her husband had told her that she would be bankrupted if she did not enter into the mortgage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2494	Nor did he elicit the fact -LRB- about which she gave evidence -RRB- that she did not consider the marriage to have any long term future but wished , on the other hand , to avoid bringing it to an end until her son -LRB- aged 14 at the beginning of 1983 -RRB- was older and to maintain a tolerable atmosphere at home in the meantime while she was living with Mr Kenyon-Brown . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2495	These are considerations which would have been central to an evaluation whether it made sense for the wife to enter into the mortgage and to a balanced decision whether to do so , made free of any undue influence by Mr Kenyon-Brown . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2496	Mr Banks did not know of them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2497	Nor , therefore , could he either discuss them with Mrs Kenyon-Brown or , if he concluded in their light that a conflict of interest existed , suggest that she discuss them with another solicitor . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2498	374 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2499	Save as to the amount of the then current indebtedness of Mr Kenyon-Brown to the bank , Mr Banks had , in my opinion , no duty or reason to make the enquiries referred to . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2500	Some of the enquiries , eg eliciting the fact that Mrs Kenyon-Brown did not consider her marriage to have a long term future , would have been an unpardonable impertinence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2501	Mr Banks was entitled to treat Mrs Kenyon-Brown as a mature lady able to make up her own mind as to whether to allow her share in Rock Cottage to become security for her husband 's debts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2502	What he did need to do , and , on the judge 's findings , did do , was to try and make sure that she understood the nature and effect of the document she was being asked to sign . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2503	Wilson J , in his dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal , set out , at pp 288-289 , in paragraphs lettered -LRB- a -RRB- to -LRB- i -RRB- the circumstances that , in his view , determined the extent of the duty owed by Mr Banks to his client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
154	2504	He concluded that Mr Banks had discharged that duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls
