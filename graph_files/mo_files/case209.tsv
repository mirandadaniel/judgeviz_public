209	1	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	2	LORD BINGHAM OF CORNHILL 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	4	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	5	The immense , perhaps unprecedented , suffering of many people in many countries during the twentieth century had at least one positive result : that it prompted a strong international determination to prevent and prohibit the waging of aggressive war . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	6	This determination found expression in the international legal order , and understandably so , since it is states which wage such wars and states that must suppress them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	7	At issue in these appeals is the extent to which , if at all , this international determination is transposed into the domestic legal order of England and Wales . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	8	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	9	There are 20 appellants before the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	10	All of them committed acts in February or March 2003 which were , or are alleged to have been , criminal offences , unless there was legal justification for what they did or are said to have done . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	11	The issue in each appeal concerns this legal justification , which -LRB- depending on the charge in question -RRB- differs somewhat from case to case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	12	But the common feature of all the appeals , and the feature which makes the cases important , is that they all raise the question whether the crime of aggression , if established in customary international law , is a crime recognised by or forming part of the domestic criminal law of England and Wales . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	13	The appellants acted as they did because they wished to impede , obstruct or disrupt the commission of that crime , or what they believed would be the commission of that crime , by Her Majesty 's Government or the Government of the United States against Iraq in the weeks and days before -LRB- as we now know -RRB- hostilities began . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	14	They accordingly contend , or have contended , that they were legally justified in acting as they did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	15	The House is not asked to rule whether , in preparing to make war against Iraq , the United Kingdom or the United States committed the international law crime of aggression , but it must rule whether , if they may have done , that would justify the appellants ' otherwise criminal conduct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	16	The Fairford appellants 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	17	On the night of 13 March 2003 the appellants Margaret Jones and Paul Milling broke into the Royal Air Force base at Fairford in Gloucestershire and caused damage to fuel tankers and bomb trailers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	18	They had conspired together to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	19	A little later , the appellants Toby Olditch and Philip Pritchard conspired together to cause criminal damage at the base . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	20	On 18 March 2003 they had in their possession articles which they intended to use to destroy or damage the runway at the base and aircraft belonging to the United States Air Force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	21	On the same date , 18 March 2003 , the appellant Josh Richards attempted to set fire to an aircraft at the base belonging to the United States Air Force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	22	He had with him on that date articles which he intended to use to destroy or damage such aircraft . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	23	Also on that date , he caused damage to a perimeter fence at the base . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	24	It is convenient to refer to these appellants collectively as `` the Fairford appellants '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	25	In indictments preferred against them they were -LRB- after the withdrawal of one count -RRB- charged with counts of conspiracy to cause criminal damage contrary to section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Criminal Law Act 1977 -LRB- Jones , Milling , Olditch , Pritchard -RRB- , having articles with intent to destroy or damage property contrary to section 3 -LRB- b -RRB- of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 -LRB- Olditch , Pritchard , Richards -RRB- and criminal damage contrary to section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1971 Act and attempted arson contrary to section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 -LRB- Richards -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	26	The Fairford appellants have not yet been tried . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	27	Thus the factual basis of these counts has not been proved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	28	But the facts recounted above are not understood to be contested . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	29	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	30	A preparatory hearing was held under section 29 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 to seek rulings on some questions of law arising from the proposed defences of the Fairford appellants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	31	Relevantly , the question was raised whether the defence of using reasonable force under section 3 of the 1967 Act was available to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	32	Sitting at Bristol , Grigson J ruled on 12 May 2004 -LRB- 1 -RRB- that foreign policy and the deployment of the armed services involved the exercise of prerogative power and could not raise justiciable issues , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- that the citizen could not plead lawful justification for interfering with the exercise of that power -LRB- including the power to make war -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	33	The judge accepted , as the Crown had accepted in argument , that the appellants were entitled to contend that they had been acting to prevent the commission of war crimes within the scope of the International Criminal Court Act 2001 , so the argument was directed to the crime of aggression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	34	The appellants challenged the judge 's ruling in the Court of Appeal -LRB- Criminal Division -RRB- -LRB- Latham LJ , Gibbs J and His Honour Judge Brown -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	35	It ruled -LRB- -LSB- 2004 -RSB- EWCA Crim 1981 , -LSB- 2005 -RSB- QB 259 -RRB- that the crime of aggression which the appellants claimed they were seeking to prevent was not a `` crime '' for the purposes of section 3 of the 1967 Act , and that accordingly the issue of justiciability did not call for decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	36	It certified as a question of general public importance : It has not been suggested that there is any difference of substance between a `` crime against peace '' and a `` crime of aggression '' and I shall for convenience use the latter expression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	37	The Marchwood appellants 5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	38	It is convenient to refer to the appellant Benjamin Ayliffe and his 13 co-appellants as `` the Marchwood appellants '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	39	On 4 February 2003 , some weeks before hostilities began against Iraq , they trespassed on the land of the Sea Mounting Centre , Marchwood Military Port , at Hythe in Hampshire . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	40	Some of them entered the port by boat . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	41	Others cut a hole in the perimeter wire and entered the port through it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	42	Some of them chained themselves to tanks or reconnaissance vehicles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	43	The work of the port , which involved the loading of vessels bound for the Middle East , was brought to a halt , as they intended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	44	They were all charged with the offence of aggravated trespass contrary to section 68 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 , the charge being that they trespassed on land in the open air and , in relation to a lawful activity , namely port operations , which persons were engaged in on that land , did an act intended to have the effect of obstructing that activity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	45	There was also a charge of criminal damage contrary to section 1 of the 1971 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	46	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	47	The Marchwood appellants appeared before District Judge Woollard in the Southampton Magistrates ' Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	48	They argued that the activity being carried on at Marchwood was not a lawful activity within the section because it was being carried out in pursuance of a crime of aggression under customary international law and constituted a war crime within the meaning of sections 51 and 52 of the International Criminal Court Act 2001 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	49	They also relied on section 3 of the 1967 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	50	The judge ruled at a preliminary hearing that `` offence '' in section 68 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1994 Act means `` a specific offence known to English law by common law or statute '' , and thus excludes the crime of aggression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	51	At a later preliminary hearing when the Marchwood appellants sought wide-ranging disclosure said to be relevant to their defences under section 3 of the 1967 Act and under the 2001 Act , the judge refused to make an order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	52	He held that the foreign and defence policies of the Government were not matters into which the court could enquire . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	53	At trial , all the appellants were convicted of aggravated trespass , and some were convicted of criminal damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	54	They were conditionally discharged or fined , and some compensation orders were made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	55	The judge stated a case for the opinion of the High Court on the correctness of his rulings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	56	The appellant Valerie Swain 7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	57	On 9 March 2003 the appellant Valerie Swain and others trespassed on the RAF base at Fairford which she entered by cutting a hole in the perimeter fence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	58	She intended to obstruct or disrupt the maintenance of the security of the base . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	59	She -LRB- with nine others -RRB- was charged with aggravated trespass contrary to section 68 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1994 Act , alleging that she trespassed on the base and `` in relation to a lawful activity , namely the maintenance of security of the base '' did an act , namely cut a hole in the perimeter fence , which she intended to obstruct or disrupt that activity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	60	She was also charged with criminal damage contrary to section 1 of the 1971 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	61	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	62	This appellant advanced very much the same defences as the Marchwood appellants and District Judge Clark , sitting in the Cirencester Magistrates ' Court , ruled at a preliminary hearing that the defences were not maintainable because the decision to go to war and its continuance were not justiciable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	63	At trial this appellant and her co-defendants were convicted of aggravated trespass and criminal damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	64	She was conditionally discharged and ordered to pay costs and compensation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	65	She alone appealed by way of case stated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	66	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	67	The appeals of this appellant and the Marchwood appellants were heard together in the Divisional Court -LRB- Waller LJ and Jack J -RRB- , and dismissed : -LSB- 2005 -RSB- EWHC 684 -LRB- Admin -RRB- , -LSB- 2006 -RSB- QB 227 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	68	It was accepted that the court was bound by the Court of Appeal 's judgment on the appeal of the Fairford appellants , and also that the ratio of that case governed the court 's decision on section 68 of the 1994 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	69	The court certified that these appeals raised two questions of general public importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	70	The first was The second was in substance that certified in the case of the Fairford appellants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	71	The appellants ' argument 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	72	The appellants ' case was deployed with much erudition and elaboration , to which any summary must necessarily do injustice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	73	But I think their argument , expressed in a composite manner and in my own words , not theirs , involves the following major propositions : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Customary international law is -LRB- without the need for any domestic statute or judicial decision -RRB- part of the domestic law of England and Wales . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	74	-LRB- 2 -RRB- At all times relevant to these appeals customary international law has recognised a crime of aggression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	75	-LRB- 3 -RRB- Crimes recognised in customary international law are -LRB- without the need for any domestic statute or judicial decision -RRB- recognised and enforced by the domestic law of England and Wales . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	76	-LRB- 4 -RRB- `` Crime '' in section 3 of the 1967 Act covers a crime established in customary international law , such as the crime of aggression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	77	-LRB- 5 -RRB- Alternatively , `` crime '' in section 3 means a crime in the domestic law of England and Wales , and the crime of aggression is such . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	78	-LRB- 6 -RRB- `` Offence '' in section 68 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1994 Act covers an offence established in customary international law , such as the crime of aggression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	79	-LRB- 7 -RRB- Alternatively , `` offence '' in section 68 -LRB- 2 -RRB- means a crime in the domestic law of England and Wales , and the crime of aggression is such . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	80	I shall consider these steps in turn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	81	-LRB- 1 -RRB- Customary international law is -LRB- without the need for any domestic statute or judicial decision -RRB- part of the domestic law of England and Wales . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	82	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	83	The appellants contended that the law of nations in its full extent is part of the law of England and Wales . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	84	The Crown did not challenge the general truth of this proposition , for which there is indeed old and high authority : see , for example , Triquet v Bath -LRB- 1764 -RRB- 3 Burr 1478 , 1481 ; Blackstone 's Commentaries , Bk IV , Chap 5 , p 67 ; Duke of Brunswick v King of Hanover -LRB- 1844 -RRB- 6 Beav 1 , 51-52 ; Emperor of Austria v Day -LRB- 1861 -RRB- 2 Giff 628 , 678 ; Chung Chi Cheung v The King -LSB- 1939 -RSB- AC 160 , 167-168 ; Trendtex Trading Corporation v Central Bank of Nigeria -LSB- 1977 -RSB- QB 529 , 554 ; J H Rayner -LRB- Mincing Lane -RRB- Ltd v Department of Trade and Industry -LSB- 1989 -RSB- Ch 72 , 207 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	85	I would for my part hesitate , at any rate without much fuller argument , to accept this proposition in quite the unqualified terms in which it has often been stated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	86	There seems to be truth in Brierly 's contention -LRB- `` International Law in England '' -LRB- 1935 -RRB- 51 LQR 24 , 31 -RRB- , also espoused by the appellants , that international law is not a part , but is one of the sources , of English law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	87	There was , however , no issue between the parties on this matter , and I am content to accept the general truth of the proposition for present purposes since the only relevant qualification is the subject of consideration below . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	88	-LRB- 2 -RRB- At all times relevant to these appeals customary international law has recognised a crime of aggression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	89	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	90	I would question whether , as ruled by the United States Military Tribunal in United States of America v Ernst von Weizsäcker et al at p 319 of its judgment of 11-13 April , 1949 , `` aggressive wars and invasions have , since time immemorial , been a violation of international law , even though specific sanctions were not provided '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	91	It may , I think , be doubtful whether such wars were recognised in customary international law as a crime when the 20th century began . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	92	But whether that be so or not , it seems to me clear that such a crime was recognised by the time the century ended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	93	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	94	It is , I think , enough to identify the major milestones along the road leading to this conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	95	A draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance , sponsored by the League of Nations , described aggressive war as an international crime in 1923 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	96	In the following year the same description was used in the preamble to a protocol recommended by the League of Nations Assembly but not ratified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	97	In 1927 the League of Nations Assembly unanimously adopted a preamble which used that description . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	98	The Pan-American Conference in 1928 unanimously resolved that `` war of aggression constitutes an international crime against the human species '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	99	In the same year the General Treaty for the Renunciation of War -LRB- 94 LNTS 57 , the `` Kellogg-Briand Pact '' -RRB- condemned recourse to war as an instrument of international policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	100	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	101	The Second World War gave new impetus to this movement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	102	The Charter of the United Nations , in its preamble and in article 2 -LRB- 4 -RRB- , set its face against the threat and use of force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	103	Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal established to try major war criminals of the European Axis at Nuremberg defined its jurisdiction as including The International Military Tribunal convicted a number of defendants of offences under this head . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	104	By General Assembly Resolution 95 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of 11 December 1946 the principles recognised by the Charter of the International Military Tribunal and its judgment were affirmed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	105	The Charter of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East was , save for an immaterial difference of wording , to the same effect as article 6 -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	106	Law No 10 of the Control Council for Germany -LRB- 20 December 1945 -RRB- recognised a crime against peace in very similar terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	107	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	108	The condemnation of aggressive war found further expression in General Assembly Resolutions 2131 -LRB-xx-RRB- of 21 December 1965 , 2625 -LRB- xxv -RRB- of 24 October 1970 and 3314 -LRB- xxix -RRB- of 14 December 1974 , in the last of which the definition of an act of aggression in contravention of the Charter was approved as including : In 1954 the International Law Commission , in a Draft Code of Offences against the Peace and Security of Mankind , defined as such offences 16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	109	In a further ILC draft code of 1996 , article 1 -LRB- 2 -RRB- declares that `` Crimes against the peace and security of mankind are crimes under international law and punishable as such , whether or not they are punishable under national law '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	110	Thus , as the commentary -LRB- paragraph -LRB- 9 -RRB- -RRB- makes clear , they are crimes `` irrespective of the existence of any corresponding national law '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	111	Article 2 of the code provides , as was established at Nuremberg , that individuals are personally responsible for crimes committed under international law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	112	Article 16 addresses the crime of aggression and provides that `` An individual who , as leader or organizer , actively participates in or orders the planning , preparation , initiation or waging of aggression committed by a State shall be responsible for a crime of aggression '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	113	Paragraph -LRB- 14 -RRB- of the commentary on article 8 makes plain that But article 16 establishes , as was held at Nuremberg and other post-war trials , that aggression is a leadership crime : it can not be committed by minions and footsoldiers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	114	Article 8 , addressing jurisdiction , provides that jurisdiction over the crime of aggression shall rest with an international criminal court , but without precluding trial of its own nationals alleged to have committed that crime by a state whose leaders participated in an act of aggression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	115	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	116	In the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court 1998 the jurisdiction of the court is limited by article 5 to `` the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	117	These are : the crime of genocide ; crimes against humanity ; war crimes ; and the crime of aggression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	118	But , by article 5 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , the court is not to exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression until a provision is adopted defining the crime and setting out the conditions under which the court may exercise jurisdiction with respect to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	119	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	120	In the Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua -LRB- Merits -RRB- -LRB- Nicaragua v United States -RRB- -LSB- 1986 -RSB- ICJ Reports 14 , para 190 , the prohibition on the use of force in article 2 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the United Nations Charter was accepted as jus cogens , a universally recognised principle of international law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	121	As Professor Brownlie has observed -LRB- Principles of Public International Law , 5th ed -LRB- 1998 -RRB- , p 566 -RRB- , `` whatever the state of the law in 1945 , Article 6 of the Nuremberg Charter has since come to represent general international law '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	122	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	123	It was suggested , on behalf of the Crown , that the crime of aggression lacked the certainty of definition required of any criminal offence , particularly a crime of this gravity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	124	This submission was based on the requirement in article 5 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Rome statute that the crime of aggression be the subject of definition before the international court exercised jurisdiction to try persons accused of that offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	125	This was an argument which found some favour with the Court of Appeal -LRB- in para 43 of its judgment -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	126	I would not for my part accept it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	127	It is true that some states parties to the Rome statute have sought an extended and more specific definition of aggression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	128	It is also true that there has been protracted discussion of whether a finding of aggression against a state by the Security Council should be a necessary pre-condition of the court 's exercise of jurisdiction to try a national of that state accused of committing the crime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	129	I do not , however , think that either of these points undermines the appellants ' essential proposition that the core elements of the crime of aggression have been understood , at least since 1945 , with sufficient clarity to permit the lawful trial -LRB- and , on conviction , punishment -RRB- of those accused of this most serious crime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	130	It is unhistorical to suppose that the elements of the crime were clear in 1945 but have since become in any way obscure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	131	-LRB- 3 -RRB- Crimes recognised in customary international law are -LRB- without the need for any domestic statute or judicial decision -RRB- recognised and enforced by the domestic law of England and Wales . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	132	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	133	In supporting this proposition the appellants were able to rely on the great authority of Blackstone who -LRB- in Book IV , chap 5 , p 68 , of his Commentaries -RRB- listed the `` principal offences against the law of nations , animadverted on as such by the municipal laws of England '' as violation of safe conducts , infringement of the rights of ambassadors and piracy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	134	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	135	Each of these offences has a long legal genealogy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	136	A statute enacted in the reign of Edward III -LRB- see Holdsworth , A History of English Law , 1936 , vol 2 , p 450 -RRB- made it treason to kill an ambassador , and a statute of Henry V -LRB- 2 Henry V c. 6 -RRB- imposed penalties on those who broke truces or violated safe conducts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	137	The immunity of ambassadors when performing diplomatic duties was confirmed by the statute 7 Anne c. 12 , but this statute has been repeatedly recognised as declaring what the law of England , deriving from the law of nations , already was : Triquet v Bath -LRB- 1764 -RRB- 3 Burr 1478 , 1478-1479 , 1481 ; Viveash v Becker -LRB- 1814 -RRB- 3 M and S 284 , 292 ; Novello v Toogood -LRB- 1823 -RRB- 1 B and C 554 , 562 ; Taylor v Best -LRB- 1854 -RRB- 14 CB 487 , 519 ; Magdalena Steam Navigation Company v Martin -LRB- 1859 -RRB- 2 E1 and E1 94 , 114 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	138	A long series of domestic statutes dating back to 15 Ric II c. 3 addressed the crime of piracy , but the report of the Privy Council delivered by Viscount Sankey LC in Re Piracy Jure Gentium -LSB- 1934 -RSB- AC 586 , 594 , made plain that a distinction must be drawn between piracy under any municipal Act of a particular country and piracy jure gentium . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	139	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	140	While the appellants acknowledged the paucity of authority on the assimilation of customary international law crimes into municipal law , other than those listed by Blackstone , they contended that war crimes earned inclusion in any modern list . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	141	It is true that certain practices have , since mediaeval times , been regarded as contrary to the laws and usages of war . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	142	After the Second World War some countries provided for the trial of those accused of this crime by statute -LRB- as in Australia -RRB- , or Order in Council under statutory authority -LRB- Canada -RRB- , and the United States appointed military commissions , a practice which pre-dated the Constitution and was recognised but not established by statute : see Rogers , `` War Crimes Trials under the Royal Warrant : British Practice 1945-1949 '' -LRB- 1990 -RRB- 39 ICLQ 780 , 787 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	143	In this country , an enabling statute was discussed -LRB- Rogers , op . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	144	cit. , pp 788-789 -RRB- but in the event a Royal Warrant was issued under the royal prerogative on 18 June 1945 to provide for the trial in military courts of persons charged with `` violations of the laws and usages of war '' , which were treated as synonymous with war crimes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	145	Such courts were to take judicial notice of the laws and usages of war . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	146	Pursuant to this instrument some 500 trials were held during the years 1945-1949 -LRB- Rogers , op . cit. , p 795 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	147	Re Sandrock and Others -LRB- 1945 -RRB- 13 ILR 297 , which concerned the summary execution of a prisoner of war , is one reported example . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	148	Since , by 1945 , the creation of new offences lay outwith the royal prerogative , the underlying premise of the Royal Warrant must , I think , have been that war crimes , recognised as such in customary international law , had been assimilated into our domestic law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	149	It was , however , contemplated that an Act of Indemnity should be passed to give retrospective validity to the proceedings -LRB- Rogers , op . cit. , pp 788-799 -RRB- , which may betray some uncertainty on the point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	150	But history has moved on . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	151	In 1950 the International Law Commission , summarising the Principles of International Law Recognized in the Charter of the Nürnberg Tribunal and in the Judgment of the Tribunal , listed war crimes -LRB- `` Violations of the laws or customs of war '' -RRB- as crimes under international law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	152	In section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the War Crimes Act 1991 , jurisdiction was conferred on British courts to try charges of murder , manslaughter or culpable homicide against a person in this country irrespective of his nationality at the time of the alleged offence if that offence was committed between 1 September 1939 and 5 June 1945 in a place which at the time was part of Germany or under German occupation and `` constituted a violation of the laws and customs of war '' , an expression which it was not thought necessary to define . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	153	It would seem to me at least arguable that war crimes , recognised as such in customary international law , would now be triable and punishable under the domestic criminal law of this country irrespective of any domestic statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	154	But it is not necessary to decide that question , since war crimes are something quite distinct from the crime of aggression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	155	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	156	I would accordingly accept that a crime recognised in customary international law may be assimilated into the domestic criminal law of this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	157	The appellants , however , go further and contend that that result follows automatically . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	158	The authorities , as I read them , do not support that proposition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	159	Lord Cockburn CJ rejected it in R v Keyn -LRB- 1876 -RRB- 2 Ex D 63 , 203 , when he said : In R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate , Ex p Pinochet Ugarte -LRB- No 3 -RRB- -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 1 AC 147 the issue was whether British courts had jurisdiction , before section 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 came into force , to try those accused of torture abroad . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	160	But I agree with the observation of Buxton LJ in Hutchinson v Newbury Magistrates ' Court -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 122 ILR 499 , 506 , where a contention similar to the appellants ' was advanced : In the context of genocide , an argument based on automatic assimilation was rejected by a majority of the Federal Court of Australia in Nulyarimma v Thompson -LRB- 1999 -RRB- 120 ILR 353 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	161	In the context of abduction it was rejected by the Supreme Court of the United States in Sosa v Alvarez-Machain et al 542 US 692 -LRB- 2004 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	162	It is , I think , true that `` customary international law is applicable in the English courts only where the constitution permits '' : O'Keefe , `` Customary International Crimes in English Courts '' -LRB- 2001 -RRB- BYIL 293 , 335 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	163	I respectfully agree with the observations of Sir Franklin Berman -LRB- Asserting Jurisdiction : International and European Legal Perspectives , ed M Evans and S Konstantinidis , 2003 , p 11 -RRB- answering the question whether customary international law is capable of creating a crime directly triable in a national court : -LRB- 4 -RRB- `` Crime '' in section 3 of the 1967 Act covers a crime established in customary international law , such as the crime of aggression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	164	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	165	Section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 provides : A side-note `` Use of force in making arrest , etc '' follows a draft of the Criminal Law Revision Committee , 7th Report , 1965 -LRB- Cmnd 2659 -RRB- which recommended the substance of the provision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	166	It is accepted that the reasonableness of the force used must be judged objectively in the circumstances which the defendant believed to exist , but this belief can extend only to facts and not to the legal consequences or implications of those facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	167	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	168	I have some doubt whether section 3 was ever intended to apply to conduct like the appellants ' which , although causing damage to property in some cases , was entirely peaceable and involved no violence of any kind to any person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	169	In its Report on Offences of Damage to Property 1970 -LRB- Law Com No 29 -RRB- , para 49 , the Law Commission appears to have considered that a policeman who forced open a door to execute a warrant of arrest could raise a defence of lawful excuse under what became the 1971 Act , and in Hutchinson v Newbury Magistrates ' Court -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 122 ILR 499 , 508 , Buxton LJ understood section 3 to have been introduced to deal with physical force to the person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	170	It was , however , common ground before Grigson J that what the Fairford appellants did or intended to do involved a use of force ; there is authority to support that view -LRB- Swales v Cox -LSB- 1981 -RSB- QB 849 ; R v Renouf -LSB- 1986 -RSB- 1 WLR 522 -RRB- ; this question of interpretation was not the subject of appeal ; and it has not been fully investigated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	171	I shall therefore treat the section as applicable to acts such as the appellants did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	172	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	173	The main object of the 1967 Act was to amend the law of England and Wales by abolishing the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours as recommended by the Criminal Law Revision Committee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	174	Part I of the Act , headed `` Felony and Misdemeanour '' , includes section 3 and contains provisions governing matters such as arrest , trial and penalties on conviction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	175	Part II abolished a number of obsolete crimes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	176	Part III abolished tortious liability for maintenance and champerty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	177	The focus of the Act is entirely domestic , and it would seem to me very highly unlikely that Parliament understood `` crime '' in section 3 as covering crimes recognised in customary international law but not assimilated into our domestic law by any statute or judicial decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	178	In construing a domestic statute the ordinary practice is to treat `` offence '' , in the absence of an express provision to the contrary , as referring to an offence committed here against a common law or statutory rule : R -LRB- Rottman -RRB- v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis -LSB- 2002 -RSB- UKHL 20 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 AC 692 , para 67 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	179	The same approach must apply to `` crime '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	180	Nothing in the Act or in the Report on which it was based suggests a contrary intention in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	181	I can not , therefore , accept the appellants ' submission on this issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	182	-LRB- 5 -RRB- Alternatively , `` crime '' in section 3 means a crime in the domestic law of England and Wales , and the crime of aggression is such . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	183	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	184	I approach this proposition assuming the correctness of the conclusions already reached , that `` crime '' in section 3 means a crime in the domestic law of England and Wales and that a crime recognised as such in customary international law -LRB- such as the crime of aggression -RRB- may , but need not , become part of the domestic law of England and Wales without the need for any domestic statute or judicial decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	185	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	186	The lack of any statutory incorporation is not , however , a neutral factor , for two main reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	187	The first is that there now exists no power in the courts to create new criminal offences , as decided by a unanimous House in Knuller -LRB- Publishing , Printing and Promotions -RRB- Ltd v Director of Public Prosecutions -LSB- 1973 -RSB- AC 435 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	188	While old common law offences survive until abolished or superseded by statute , new ones are not created . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	189	Statute is now the sole source of new criminal offences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	190	The second reason is that when it is sought to give domestic effect to crimes established in customary international law , the practice is to legislate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	191	Examples may be found in the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 and the Geneva Conventions -LRB- Amendment -RRB- Act 1995 , dealing with breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Additional Protocols of 1977 ; the Genocide Act 1969 , giving effect to the Genocide Convention of 1948 ; the Criminal Justice Act 1988 , s 134 , giving effect to the Torture Convention of 1984 ; the War Crimes Act 1991 , giving jurisdiction to try war crimes committed abroad by foreign nationals ; the Merchant Shipping and Maritime Security Act 1997 , s 26 , giving effect to provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 relating to piracy ; and sections 51 and 52 of the International Criminal Court Act 2001 , giving effect to the Rome Statute by providing for the trial here of persons accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , but not , significantly , the crime of aggression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	192	It would be anomalous if the crime of aggression , excluded -LRB- obviously deliberately -RRB- from the 2001 Act , were to be treated as a domestic crime , since it would not be subject to the constraints -LRB- as to the need for the Attorney General 's consent , the mode of trial , the requisite mens rea , the liability of secondary parties and maximum penalties -RRB- applicable to the crimes which were included . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	193	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	194	These reasons , taken together , are very strong grounds for rejecting the appellants ' contention , since they reflect what has become an important democratic principle in this country : that it is for those representing the people of the country in Parliament , not the executive and not the judges , to decide what conduct should be treated as lying so far outside the bounds of what is acceptable in our society as to attract criminal penalties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	195	One would need very compelling reasons for departing from that principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	196	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	197	In the present case , involving the crime of aggression , there are compelling reasons for not departing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	198	A charge of aggression , if laid against an individual in a domestic court , would involve determination of his responsibility as a leader but would presuppose commission of the crime by his own state or a foreign state . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	199	Thus resolution of the charge would -LRB- unless the issue had been decided by the Security Council or some other third party -RRB- call for a decision on the culpability in going to war either of Her Majesty 's Government or a foreign government , or perhaps both if the states had gone to war as allies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	200	But there are well-established rules that the courts will be very slow to review the exercise of prerogative powers in relation to the conduct of foreign affairs and the deployment of the armed services , and very slow to adjudicate upon rights arising out of transactions entered into between sovereign states on the plane of international law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	201	The first of these rules is vouched by authorities such as Chandler v Director of Public Prosecutions -LSB- 1964 -RSB- AC 763 , 791 , 796 ; Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service -LSB- 1985 -RSB- AC 374 , 398 ; Lord Advocate 's Reference No 1 of 2000 2001 JC 143 , para 60 ; R -LRB- Marchiori -RRB- v The Environment Agency -LSB- 2002 -RSB- EWCA Civ 03 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- EuLR 225 , paras 38-40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	202	The second rule is supported by such authorities as Buttes Gas and Oil Co v Hammer -LSB- 1982 -RSB- AC 888 , 932 ; J H Rayner -LRB- Mincing Lane -RRB- Limited v Department for Trade and Industry -LSB- 1990 -RSB- 2 AC 418 , 499 ; Westland Helicopters Limited v Arab Organisation for Industrialisation -LSB- 1995 -RSB- QB 282 , 292 ; and R -LRB- on the application of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament -RRB- v Prime Minister of the United Kingdom -LSB- 2002 -RSB- EWHC 2777 -LRB- Admin -RRB- , -LSB- 2003 -RSB- 3 LRC 335 , paras 38 , 40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	203	In Buttes , at p 933 , Lord Wilberforce cited with approval the words of Fuller CJ in the United States Supreme Court in Underhill v Hernandez 168 US 250 -LRB- 1897 -RRB- , 252 : I do not suggest that these rules admit of no exceptions : cases such as Oppenheimer v Cattermole -LSB- 1976 -RSB- AC 249 and Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Company -LRB- Nos 4 and 5 -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- UKHL 19 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 AC 883 may fairly be seen as exceptions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	204	Nor , in the present context , is the issue one of justiciability , to which many of these authorities were directed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	205	In considering whether the customary international law crime of aggression has been , or should be , tacitly assimilated into our domestic law , it is nonetheless very relevant not only that Parliament has , so far , refrained from taking this step but also that it would draw the courts into an area which , in the past , they have entered , if at all , with reluctance and the utmost circumspection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	206	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	207	The potential and readily foreseeable problems which might arise if it were permissible to impede military preparations or action by the existing government in this country on the ground of their unlawfulness would not end there . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	208	For a person so acting could , at least arguably , on facts more significant than those relied on here , be said to `` be adherent to the King 's enemies in his realm , giving to them aid and comfort in the realm , or elsewhere '' within the meaning of the Treason Act 1351 , or to commit the common law offence of sedition by exciting disaffection against the government or the constitution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	209	It has never been a defence to such a charge that the Crown or the government had committed itself to an unjust or unlawful cause . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	210	It would be strange if the same conduct could be both a crime and a defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	211	The justification relied on by the appellants would also , if legally available , give rise to applications for disclosure which , if allowed , would be likely to result in the discontinuance of any prosecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	212	As the House observed in R v H -LSB- 2004 -RSB- UKHL 3 , -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 2 AC 134 , para 35 , I am of the clear opinion that the crime of aggression is not a crime in the domestic law of England and Wales within the meaning of section 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	213	-LRB- 6 -RRB- `` Offence '' in section 68 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1994 Act covers an offence established in customary international law , such as the crime of aggression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	214	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	215	Section 68 of the 1994 Act , so far as relevant to these appeals and as originally enacted , provides : The original object of the section was to penalise the activities of trespassing hunt saboteurs and animal rights activists , but the section has been widened by deleting reference to the open air . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	216	By virtue of section 172 -LRB- 10 -RRB- the section applies throughout the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	217	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	218	The 1994 Act is a long and detailed statute , addressing a large number of criminal justice matters , particularly in England and Wales but also in Scotland and Northern Ireland . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	219	Although some provisions of the Act have a wider reach -LRB- section 160 extends the powers of constables to United Kingdom waters -RRB- , section 68 is directed to land within one or other of the three domestic jurisdictions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	220	There is no suggestion that those whose activities the Marchwood appellants and the appellant Swain sought to obstruct or disrupt were themselves trespassers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	221	So the only question is whether `` offence '' in section 68 -LRB- 2 -RRB- should be understood to cover an offence under customary international law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	222	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	223	The answer to that question must be negative , for very much the same reasons as are given in para 26 above . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	224	`` Offence '' is not defined in the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	225	It must be understood as meaning an offence under the domestic criminal law of the relevant UK jurisdiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	226	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	227	This proposition must be rejected , for the reasons given in paragraphs 28 to 31 above . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	228	It is a conclusion which involves , in my opinion , no substantial injustice to the Marchwood appellants and the appellant Swain since , even if this proposition were accepted it would be all but unarguable that those whose activities these appellants obstructed or disrupted at Marchwood and Fairford were themselves committing the crime of aggression or that there was a sufficient nexus between the conduct of these appellants and the preparation for or waging of an aggressive war even if -LRB- which is not a matter for decision -RRB- the hostilities against Iraq could be properly so described . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	229	This was the conclusion reached by the courts below , and I agree with it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	230	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	231	For these reasons , which are much the same as those given by the Court of Appeal and followed by the Administrative Court , I would answer the certified questions in paragraphs 4 and 9 above together , as follows : the crime against peace -LRB- or crime of aggression -RRB- is not capable of being a `` crime '' within the meaning of section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 or an `` offence '' within the meaning of section 68 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	232	I would accordingly dismiss all the appeals . 	lord bingham	self	outcome	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann

209	236	Demonstrations against war 37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	237	The war against Iraq began with the bombing of Baghdad on 20 March 2003 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	238	It caused deep divisions among the people of the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	239	Many people thought that it was morally wrong and contrary to international law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	240	On 15 February 2003 there was a demonstration in central London in which about a million people marched through the streets to demonstrate their opposition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	241	Others thought that it was justified , necessary and lawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	242	A motion in support of the war was passed by the House of Commons on 18 March by a majority of 396 to 217 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	243	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	244	In the weeks before the war , some people protested by acts of civil disobedience at military installations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	245	These appeals are concerned with incidents which occurred during February and March 2003 at a military port facility at Marchwood , Southampton and at the airbase at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	246	At Marchwood demonstrators entered the port area and chained themselves to railings and to tanks which were about to be loaded onto ships . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	247	At Fairford they entered by cutting the perimeter fence and caused damage to vehicles or otherwise disrupted activities at the base . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	248	The appellants were arrested and charged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	249	The charges 39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	250	Most of the demonstrators were prosecuted summarily before the Magistrates ' Courts -LRB- at Southampton or Cirencester respectively -RRB- on charges of aggravated trespass or criminal damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	251	Aggravated trespass is an offence under section 68 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	252	At the time of these events -LRB- the scope of the offence has since been broadened -RRB- it was committed by a person who -- 40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	253	Criminal damage is an offence under section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 : 41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	254	Section 5 enlarges upon the concept of reasonable excuse : 42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	255	In addition , one group of Fairford demonstrators was charged with offences such as conspiracy to cause criminal damage , which can be tried only on indictment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	256	They were brought before the Crown Court at Bristol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	257	For reasons which I shall explain , the trial has not yet taken place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	258	The defences 43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	259	In essence , all the demonstrators said that their actions were justified , not only morally but also legally , because they were aimed at preventing a greater evil , namely the war in Iraq and its probable consequences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	260	Translating these generalities into the terms of the various statutes , they said that their acts of disruption were not aggravated trespass because the activities of the Crown at Marchwood and Fairford were not lawful within the meaning of section 68 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	261	They involved the commission of criminal offences associated with the prosecution of the war . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	262	Likewise , the intention to prevent the commission of a crime was a `` lawful excuse '' for causing damage to property within the meaning of section 1 of the 1971 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	263	And , in respect of any of the offences charged , they were entitled to rely upon section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 : 44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	264	All these defences thus depend upon the proposition that the war in Iraq was a crime as well as a mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	265	What was that crime ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	266	Various offences were suggested but all except one have either fallen by the wayside or been left for further consideration at a later stage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	267	The one which remains is the crime of aggression , the unlawful use of war as an instrument of national policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	268	There is no doubt that this is a recognised crime in international law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	269	Twelve of the major German war criminals were convicted of aggression in one form or another by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg and eight of them were executed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	270	This decision has since received general international approbation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	271	Article 5 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court lists `` the crime of aggression '' together with genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes as the crimes over which the Court is to have jurisdiction , these being `` the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	272	But the Statute postpones the exercise of jurisdiction over the crime of aggression until the adoption of a provision which defines the crime and sets out the conditions under which the jurisdiction is to be exercised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	273	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	274	Anticipating that the prosecution might not share its view that the war constituted aggression , the defendants proposed that the issue be determined by the District Judges at Southampton and Cirencester or the jury at Bristol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	275	For this purpose , they made applications for disclosure of a wide range of documents of which the following -LRB- taken from the proceedings in Southampton -RRB- is a small sample : 46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	276	In the event , the applications for disclosure were rejected because the District Judges at both Southampton and Cirencester ruled that aggression was not an offence within the meaning of section 68 of the 1994 Act or a crime within the meaning of section 3 of the 1967 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	277	It was therefore unnecessary to decide whether the war had been lawful or not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	278	The District Judges said that there was no evidence that the activities of the Crown upon the land involved the commission of any other offences and convicted all the defendants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	279	They were conditionally discharged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	280	The defendants appealed by way of case stated to the Divisional Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	281	47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	282	At Bristol , there was a preparatory hearing before Grigson J under section 29 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	283	The judge was invited to give preliminary rulings as to various matters , including the extent to which the defendants could rely upon the alleged illegality of the war -LRB- or their beliefs as to its illegality -RRB- for the purposes of section 3 of the 1967 Act , `` lawful excuse '' under section 1 of the 1971 Act and the common law defence of necessity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	284	It is not necessary to set out the terms of the judge 's rulings because they were all appealed by one side or the other to the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	285	The appeals 48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	286	The appeal from the Bristol Crown Court came before the Court of Appeal in June 2004 : see R v Jones -LRB- Margaret -RRB- -LSB- 2005 -RSB- QB 259 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	287	The Court decided that `` crime '' in section 3 of the 1967 Act meant a crime in domestic law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	288	It was not sufficient that it was a crime under a foreign or international law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	289	It then proceeded to consider whether , by virtue of the principle that international law forms part of English law , the crime of aggression had been incorporated into domestic law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	290	It rejected this submission on the ground that the definition of aggression was too uncertain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	291	The article defining the crime for the purposes of the Rome Statute had not yet been agreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	292	There was no international agreement over whether , for example , the International Criminal Court could exercise its jurisdiction without there having been a determination of the Security Council . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	293	So the Court of Appeal said : 49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	294	On the questions of lawful excuse and necessity , the court said that it was only necessary to decide whether these defences could raise an issue as to the legality of the war in Iraq . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	295	It decided that no such issue could arise because , assuming the other elements in the defence to be made out , all that mattered was the honest opinion of the defendants about the need for action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	296	The court rejected a prosecution argument that the threatened damage to property must be unlawful and that it could not be a lawful excuse that one had intended to prevent damage which would be the inevitable consequences of warfare . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	297	50 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	298	The appeal from the Magistrates ' Courts was heard by the Divisional Court in February 2005 : see Ayliffe v Director of Public Prosecutions -LSB- 2006 -RSB- QB 227 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	299	The court followed the decision of the Court of Appeal in rejecting the arguments that aggression was a `` crime '' for the purposes of the 1967 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	300	It held that it was likewise not an `` offence '' for the purposes of section 68 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1994 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	301	The Divisional Court also dealt with the question of whether there was any ground for an argument that the defendants were acting to prevent war crimes , that is to say , crimes like wilful killing or taking hostages , committed in the course of what might otherwise be a lawful war . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	302	These had been made offences in English domestic law by section 51 of and Schedule 8 to the International Criminal Court Act 2001 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	303	The court said that no issue had been raised at the trial as to whether such crimes were likely to be committed and in any case there could be no connection between the actions at Marchwood and Fairford and possible war crimes in Iraq . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	304	Jack J put the reasoning in a single sentence : `` The reality is that these were protests and ... not attempts to prevent crimes . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	305	The certified question 51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	306	The Court of Appeal in R v Jones -LRB- Margaret -RRB- certified two questions of general public importance : 52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	307	The second question was presumably included at the request of the prosecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	308	But only the defendants sought the leave of the House to appeal , which was granted on 1 November 2004 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	309	53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	310	In Ayliffe v Director of Public Prosecutions the Divisional Court certified two questions of general public importance : The House gave the defendants leave to appeal on 28 July 2005 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	311	Section 3 of the 1967 Act 54 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	312	I think it is clear that `` crime '' in section 3 means a crime in domestic law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	313	The Act was passed to give effect to the Seventh Report of the Criminal Law Revision Committee , Felonies and Misdemeanours , which had been published in May 1965 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	314	The Committee recommended the abolition of the ancient distinction between felonies and misdemeanours and dealt with certain questions which would need to be clarified once the distinction had gone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	315	One of these arose out of the existence of some old authority -LRB- `` very obscure '' -RRB- which suggested that extreme force could be used to arrest a person or prevent a crime only when the crime was a felony . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	316	The Committee -LRB- paragraphs 20-23 -RRB- recommended against any attempt to clarify the degree of force which could be used or the circumstances in which it could be justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	317	But they suggested a clause to make it clear that it should make no difference whether the offence had been a felony or a misdemeanour . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	318	That clause became section 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	319	55 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	320	This background suggests that `` crime '' in section 3 means something which had previously been either a felony or a misdemeanour : a form of classification peculiar to the common law and inapplicable to foreign or international law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	321	And , as my noble and learned friend Lord Rodger of Earlsferry pointed out in the course of argument , that is confirmed by the long title of the Act : 56 . 	lord hoffmann	lord rodger	partagr	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	322	`` Crimes '' in the long title are self-evidently domestic crimes and in my opinion `` crime '' in section 3 must have the same meaning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	323	57 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	324	The main thrust of the appellants ' argument is that aggression is indeed a crime in English domestic law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	325	They point out that in Trendtex Trading Corporation v Central Bank of Nigeria -LSB- 1977 -RSB- QB 529 , 553-554 Lord Denning MR discussed the two rival schools of thought on the relationship between international law and domestic law : the one saying that the rules of international law as they exist from time to time are `` incorporated into English law automatically and considered to be part of English law unless they are in conflict with an Act of Parliament '' and the other saying that they did not become part of English law unless adopted by `` the decisions of the judges , or by Act of Parliament , or long established custom '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	326	Lord Denning preferred the former view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	327	More recently , in Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Co -LRB- Nos 4 and 5 -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 AC 883 , 1081-1082 , this House refused to recognise the effect of a domestic law of Iraq on the title to property situated within Iraq on the ground that the property had been brought to Iraq after being plundered in the course of the invasion of Kuwait which was contrary to international law and condemned as aggression by the Security Council . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	328	58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	329	Lest it be said that these cases are concerned only with the civil law , the appellants draw attention to cases in which crimes under international law have been treated as ipso facto forming part of domestic law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	330	Blackstone -LRB- Commentaries on the Laws of England , Book IV , Chap 5 -RRB- records that violation of safe-conducts and the rights of ambassadors , as well as piracy , were treated as offences in English law because they were offences against the law of nations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	331	And in In re Piracy Jure Gentium -LSB- 1934 -RSB- AC 586 the Privy Council looked to international law as a `` living and expanding code '' -LRB- p 592 -RRB- for the definition of the crime of piracy triable in a British court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	332	59 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	333	I say nothing about the reception into English law of rules of international law which may affect rights and duties in civil law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	334	But there are two reasons why I think that aggression has not become a domestic crime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	335	One concerns new international law crimes in general and the other reason is peculiar to the crime of aggression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	336	Before explaining them , I should say that I do not rely upon the reason given by the Court of Appeal , namely that the elements of the offence are too uncertain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	337	It is true that there is at present no consensus about the circumstances in which the International Criminal Court should exercise its jurisdiction to try the crime of aggression and in particular whether the imprimatur of the Security Council should have to appear on the indictment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	338	But I think that upon analysis it will be found that these disputes are not about the definition of the crime but about the circumstances in which the International Criminal Court -LRB- as opposed to some domestic or ad hoc international tribunal , such as the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg -RRB- should try someone for committing it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	339	Of course the definition of a crime so recent and so rarely punished will have uncertainties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	340	But that is true of other crimes as well . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	341	If the core elements of the crime are certain enough to have secured convictions at Nuremberg , or to enable everyone to agree that it was committed by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait , then it is in my opinion sufficiently defined to be a crime , whether in international or domestic law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	342	60 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	343	I come then to the two reasons why I think that aggression is not a crime in English domestic law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	344	The first is the democratic principle that it is nowadays for Parliament and Parliament alone to decide whether conduct not previously regarded as criminal should be made an offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	345	In the eighteenth century judges were less inhibited about creating new offences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	346	Perhaps the last assertion of that power was by Viscount Simonds in Shaw v Director of Public Prosecutions -LSB- 1962 -RSB- AC 220 , 268 : 61 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	347	But this opinion has since been repudiated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	348	In Knuller -LRB- Publishing , Printing and Promotions -RRB- Ltd v Director of Public Prosecutions -LSB- 1973 -RSB- AC 435 all members of the House were agreed that , as Lord Reid said -LRB- at pp 457-458 -RRB- , the courts do not 62 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	349	The same reasoning applies to the incorporation into domestic law of new crimes in international law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	350	The law concerning safe conducts , ambassadors and piracy is very old . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	351	But new domestic offences should in my opinion be debated in Parliament , defined in a statute and come into force on a prescribed date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	352	They should not creep into existence as a result of an international consensus to which only the executive of this country is a party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	353	In Sosa v Alvarez-Machain -LRB- 2004 -RRB- 159 L Ed 2d 718 , 765 , Scalia J recently said : At least so far as the criminal law is concerned , I think that the same is true of English law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	354	63 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	355	My second reason for rejecting aggression as a domestic crime is that , in the absence of statutory authority , the prosecution of that particular crime in a domestic court would be inconsistent with a fundamental principle of our constitution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	356	Aggression is a crime in which the principal is always the state itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	357	The liability of individuals is in a sense secondary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	358	Thus the International Law Commission 's Draft Code of Crimes Against the Peace and Security of Mankind -LRB- see ILC Yearbook 1996 , Vol II , Part Two , p 42 -RRB- defined individual liability in article 16 by reference to the action of the state : 64 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	359	The commentary explains : 65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	360	How , consistently with our constitution , is liability for such a crime to be determined in a domestic court ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	361	First , there is the theoretical difficulty of the courts , as the judicial branch of government , holding not merely that some officer of the state has acted unlawfully -LRB- as in , for example , M v Home Office -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 377 -RRB- but , as a sine qua non condition , that the state itself , of which the courts form part , has acted unlawfully . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	362	Secondly , there is the practical difficulty that the making of war and peace and the disposition of the armed forces has always been regarded as a discretionary power of the Crown into the exercise of which the courts will not enquire . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	363	I say that it is a practical difficulty because , as Lord Devlin pointed out in Chandler v Director of Public Prosecutions -LSB- 1964 -RSB- AC 763 , 806-812 , the reason why the courts can not enquire is not the technicality that the powers form part of the royal prerogative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	364	Lord Devlin 's view that the prerogative origin of the powers did not in itself exclude judicial control was affirmed by the House in Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service -LSB- 1985 -RSB- AC 374 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	365	It is because of the discretionary nature of the power itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	366	As Lord Devlin said -LRB- at pp.809-810 -RRB- : 66 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	367	It is of course open to the court to say that the act in question falls wholly outside the ambit of the discretionary power . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	368	But that is not the case here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	369	The decision to go to war , whether one thinks it was right or wrong , fell squarely within the discretionary powers of the Crown to defend the realm and conduct its foreign affairs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	370	67 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	371	To say that these matters are not justiciable may be simply another way of putting the same point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	372	But I would not accept the implication , inherent in the way the certified questions are formulated , that one can first decide whether aggression is a crime in English domestic law and then go on to consider whether the issues which it raises are justiciable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	373	Mr Rabinder Singh QC , who appeared for the defendants in Ayliffe v Director of Public Prosecutions submitted that it would be contrary to the right to a fair trial under article 6 of the Convention for a defendant to be told that he could not rely on a defence otherwise open to him because it raised questions which were not justiciable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	374	There seemed to me to be much force in this submission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	375	But , as Mr Singh readily acknowledged , article 6 does not require that , as a matter of substantive criminal law , any particular defence should be available to the defendant : compare Matthews v Ministry of Defence -LSB- 2003 -RSB- 1 AC 1163 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	376	The discretionary nature or non-justiciability of the power to make war is in my opinion simply one of the reasons why aggression is not a crime in domestic law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	377	It follows that an intention to prevent aggression can not be a defence under section 3 of the 1967 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	378	Disposition 68 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	379	It follows that the first part of the certified question in R v Jones -LRB- Margaret -RRB- can be answered no and that is sufficient to enable the appeals by the defendants to be dismissed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	380	As the prosecution has not appealed , there is no need to answer the second certified question and , since the appeal is interlocutory and the case must go back to the Bristol Crown Court for trial , it is unnecessary to say anything more about it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	381	69 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	382	The first parts of the certified questions in Ayliffe v Director of Public Prosecutions can likewise be answered no and the appeals dismissed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	383	But Mr David Perry , who appeared for the prosecution in the latter case , invited your Lordships , in both his printed case and oral submissions , to dismiss the appeals on broader grounds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	384	These raised issues of very considerable public importance concerning the scope of justification for acts of civil disobedience . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	385	Mr Keir Starmer QC , who appeared for the appellants in R v Jones -LRB- Margaret -RRB- , said that the House should confine itself to the certified questions and not say anything about the grounds upon which Mr Perry relied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	386	But the jurisdiction of the House in dealing with the appeals is not limited to answering the certified questions : see Attorney-General for Northern Ireland v Gallagher -LSB- 1963 -RSB- AC 349 and your Lordships may dispose of the proceedings in Ayliffe v Director of Public Prosecutions on any grounds which appear to be appropriate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	387	Those proceedings will now be finally concluded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	388	I do not think that your Lordships should refrain from expressing your opinions on matters fairly raised by the respondents simply because they may be thought to have some relevance to the conduct of the trial in R v Jones -LRB- Margaret -RRB- when it returns to the Bristol Crown Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	389	That will be a matter for the judge at the trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	390	70 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	391	Put shortly , Mr Perry 's submission was that even if aggression was a crime in domestic law and the defendants honestly believed that the United Kingdom was about to commit it , section 3 of the 1967 Act would not justify the action which they took . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	392	The section says that a person may use `` such force as is reasonable '' and it was not reasonable in all the circumstances for the defendants to have taken it into their own hands to use any force at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	393	71 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	394	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	395	I pass over the question of whether damaging property counts as the use of force within the meaning of section 3 of the 1967 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	396	There is much to be said for the view that offences against property have their own provisions for justification , such as `` reasonable excuse '' as defined in section 5 of the 1971 Act and that `` force '' in section 3 means force against persons committing crimes or escaping arrest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	397	But I am willing to assume for the sake of argument that chaining oneself to railings or putting sugar into the petrol tanks of lorries involves the use of force for the purposes of section 3 of the 1967 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	398	72 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	399	In R v Baker and Wilkins -LSB- 1997 -RSB- Crim LR 497 the Court of Appeal decided that in considering whether a defendant was entitled to rely upon section 3 , it must be assumed that the events which the defendant apprehended were actually going to happen . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	400	Provided that his belief was honest , it did not matter that it was unreasonable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	401	If those events would in law constitute a crime , he was entitled to use such force as was reasonable to prevent it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	402	73 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	403	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	404	I have no difficulty with these propositions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	405	I am willing to assume that , in judging whether the defendant acted reasonably , it must be assumed that the facts were as he honestly believed them to be . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	406	But the question remains as to whether in such circumstances his use of force would be reasonable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	407	And that is an objective question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	408	The position may be different under section 5 of the 1971 Act but section 3 of the 1967 Act does not excuse a defendant if he uses such force as he himself thinks to be reasonable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	409	It must actually have been reasonable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	410	74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	411	The crucial question , in my opinion , is whether one judges the reasonableness of the defendant 's actions as if he was the sheriff in a Western , the only law man in town , or whether it should be judged in its actual social setting , in a democratic society with its own appointed agents for the enforcement of the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	412	I take , by way of example only , the statement by Margaret Jones and Paul Milling appended to their printed case , which states their beliefs when they entered RAF Fairford : 75 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	413	That is a fair picture of what an observer from the United Kingdom would have thought of a somewhat ineffectual attempt by a Second World War résistante to sabotage a German airfield in occupied France . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	414	It assumes the defendant to be a lonely individual resisting the acts of a hostile and alien state to which she owes no loyalty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	415	But the state in this case was the defendant 's own state , the state which protected and sustained her and to which she owed allegiance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	416	And the legal system which had to judge the reasonableness of her actions was that of the United Kingdom itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	417	76 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	418	It is a fundamental characteristic of the state as a social structure that , in the classic formulation of Max Weber -LRB- Politics as a Vocation -LRB- Politik als Beruf -RRB- , 1918 -RRB- , it 77 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	419	That formulation does not of course answer the questions which arise in these appeals , because the appellants say that the state , by its legislation , did indeed permit them to use physical force in the circumstances which existed , or which they honestly thought to exist . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	420	But when Parliament speaks of a person being entitled to use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances , the court must , in judging what is reasonable , take into account the reason why the state claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	421	A tight control of the use of force is necessary to prevent society from sliding into anarchy , what Hobbes -LRB- Leviathan , Chapter 13 -RRB- called the state of nature in which 78 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	422	In principle , therefore , the state entrusts the power to use force only to the armed forces , the police and other similarly trained and disciplined law enforcement officers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	423	Ordinary citizens who apprehend breaches of the law , whether affecting themselves , third parties or the community as a whole , are normally expected to call in the police and not to take the law into their own hands . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	424	In Southwark London Borough Council v Williams -LSB- 1971 -RSB- Ch 734 , 745 Edmund Davies LJ said : 79 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	425	There are exceptions when the threat of serious unlawful injury is imminent and it is not practical to call for help . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	426	The most obvious example is the right of self-defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	427	As Hobbes said -LRB- Leviathan , Chapter 27 -RRB- : But , he went on to say : 80 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	428	In the same spirit as Hobbes , Lord Upjohn said in Burmah Oil Co Ltd v Lord Advocate -LSB- 1965 -RSB- AC 75 , 164 - 165 : 81 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	429	What is true of the use of self-help to protect one 's own interests is a fortiori true of the use of self-help to protect the interests of third parties or the community at large . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	430	In a moment of emergency , when individual action is necessary to prevent some imminent crime or to apprehend an escaping criminal , it may be legitimate , praiseworthy even , for the citizen to use force on his own initiative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	431	But when law enforcement officers , if called upon , would be in a position to do whatever is necessary , the citizen must leave the use of force to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	432	82 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	433	What if the sovereign power , when called , will not come ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	434	Sometimes this is for operational reasons , as when the police lack the resources to provide protection -LRB- see , for example , R v Chief Constable of Sussex , Ex p International Trader 's Ferry Ltd -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 AC 418 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	435	A citizen whose person or property is under threat would in such a case be entitled to take reasonable steps to protect himself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	436	So in R v Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall , Ex p Central Electricity Generating Board -LSB- 1982 -RSB- QB 458 , where the police refused to intervene to prevent protesters from obstructing a survey of land with a view to building a nuclear power station , the Court of Appeal said that the Board was legally entitled to use reasonable force to repel the protesters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	437	But the court did its best to discourage them from exercising this right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	438	Lord Denning MR suggested that the Board should be content with erecting a barbed wire fence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	439	83 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	440	The right of the citizen to use force on his own initiative is even more circumscribed when he is not defending his own person or property but simply wishes to see the law enforced in the interests of the community at large . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	441	The law will not tolerate vigilantes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	442	If the citizen can not get the courts to order the law enforcement authorities to act -LRB- compare R v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis , Ex p Blackburn -LSB- 1968 -RSB- 2 QB 118 -RRB- then he must use democratic methods to persuade the government or legislature to intervene . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	443	84 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	444	Often the reason why the sovereign power will not intervene is because it takes the view that the threatened action is not a crime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	445	In such a case too , the citizen is not entitled to take the law into his own hands . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	446	The rule of law requires that disputes over whether action is lawful should be resolved by the courts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	447	If the citizen is dissatisfied with the law as laid down by the courts , he must campaign for Parliament to change it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	448	So in Monsanto v Tilly -LSB- 2000 -RSB- Env LR 313 a landowner claimed an injunction against protesters who threatened to trespass upon his land and dig up genetically modified crops . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	449	They claimed to be acting in the public interest and to protect third parties from damage which the crops might cause . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	450	The Court of Appeal said that this was no defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	451	Mummery LJ said -LRB- at p 338 -RRB- : 85 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	452	It was clear that the Department , if called upon , would have done nothing to stop the growing of the genetically modified crops . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	453	It had granted Monsanto a licence under the relevant legislation for the specific purpose of enabling them to be grown . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	454	But , as Stuart-Smith LJ pointed out -LRB- at p 329 -RRB- , the protesters ' remedy , if any , was to challenge the legality of the licence by judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	455	Or , if that failed , they could seek to have the law changed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	456	But that must be effected by lawful means . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	457	Whatever the honest apprehension of danger to the community , it is not reasonable to resort to force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	458	86 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	459	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	460	to legitimate the use of force in such cases would be to set a most dangerous precedent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	461	As Lord Prosser said in Lord Advocate 's Reference No 1 of 2000 2001 JC 143 , 160G-H : 87 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	462	A time of war is the extreme example of the dangers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	463	Of course citizens are entitled , indeed required , to refuse to participate in war crimes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	464	But if they are allowed to use force against military installations simply to give effect to their own honestly held view of the legality of what the armed forces of the Crown are doing , the Statute of Treason would become a dead letter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	465	88 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	466	In my opinion , therefore , the District Judges would have been right to convict even if aggression had been a crime in domestic law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	467	The apprehension , however honest , that such a crime was about to be committed could not have made it reasonable for the defendants to use force of any kind to obstruct military activities at Marchwood or Fairford . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	468	89 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hoffmann

209	472	The suffragettes are an example which comes immediately to mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	473	It is the mark of a civilised community that it can accommodate protests and demonstrations of this kind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	474	But there are conventions which are generally accepted by the law-breakers on one side and the law-enforcers on the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	475	The protesters behave with a sense of proportion and do not cause excessive damage or inconvenience . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	476	And they vouch the sincerity of their beliefs by accepting the penalties imposed by the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	477	The police and prosecutors , on the other hand , behave with restraint and the magistrates impose sentences which take the conscientious motives of the protesters into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	478	The conditional discharges ordered by the magistrates in the cases which came before them exemplifies their sensitivity to these conventions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hoffmann

209	483	By this means they invite the court to adjudicate upon the merits of their opinions and provide themselves with a platform from which to address the media on the subject . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hoffmann

209	487	I respectfully agree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hoffmann

209	491	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	492	I do not think that it would be inconsistent with our traditional respect for conscientious civil disobedience for your Lordships to say that there will seldom if ever be any arguable legal basis upon which these forensic tactics can be deployed .

209	493	94 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	494	The practical implications of what I have been saying for the conduct of the trials of direct action protesters are clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	495	If there is an issue as to whether the defendants were justified in doing acts which would otherwise be criminal , the burden is upon the prosecution to negative that defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	496	But the issue must first be raised by facts proved or admitted , either by the prosecution or the defence , on which a jury could find that the acts were justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	497	In a case in which the defence requires that the acts of the defendant should in all the circumstances have been reasonable , his acts must be considered in the context of a functioning state in which legal disputes can be peacefully submitted to the courts and disputes over what should be law or government policy can be submitted to the arbitrament of the democratic process . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hoffmann

209	521	99 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	522	I agree in particular that there is under public international law a crime of aggression which is , as history confirms , sufficiently certain to be capable of being prosecuted in international tribunals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	523	But neither the concept of `` crime '' in section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 nor the concept of `` offence '' in section 68 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 can in my view embrace conduct which is no more than a crime under public international law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	524	So the issue is whether the public international law crime of aggression has as such automatically become , or should now be recognised as , a crime and an offence under domestic law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	525	100 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	526	It is unnecessary to consider the recognition or reception of international law in the context of civil law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	527	In Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Co -LRB- Nos 4 and 5 -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- UKHL 19 ; -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 AC 883 the courts refused in civil proceedings to recognise an expropriatory decree made in the context of armed aggression by Iraq designed to extinguish Kuwait 's existence as a separate state . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	528	101 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	529	As regards the criminal law , my noble and learned friend , Lord Bingham of Cornhill , has demonstrated in paragraphs 20-22 that crimes under public international law have in the past been received and recognised at common law as domestic crimes . 	lord mance	lord bingham	partagr	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	530	This was the case with piracy and violation of safe conducts and diplomatic immunity and , very arguably , with war crimes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	531	102 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	532	It does not follow that all public international law crimes must or should be received and recognised as domestic law crimes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	533	The expansive former view that the courts had a general residual power to recognise or in effect create new crimes , when the public interest in their view so required , no longer survives : Knuller -LRB- Publishing , Printing and Promotions -RRB- Ltd v Director of Public Prosecutions -LSB- 1973 -RSB- AC 435 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	534	The creation and regulation of crimes is in a modern Parliamentary democracy a matter par excellence for Parliament to debate and legislate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	535	Even crimes under public international law can no longer be , if they ever were , the subject of any automatic reception or recognition in domestic law by the courts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	536	103 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	537	This consideration is determinative when one considers the special nature of the crime of aggression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	538	It is a public international law crime of a different nature to any so far received and recognised in domestic law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	539	It is a crime committed primarily by the state itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	540	I agree that it would , for the reasons given by Lord Bingham of Cornhill in paragraphs 30-31 and by Lord Hoffmann in paragraphs 65-66 , be incongruous for the courts to treat it as a domestic crime without specific statutory authority . 	lord mance	lord bingham	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	540	I agree that it would , for the reasons given by Lord Bingham of Cornhill in paragraphs 30-31 and by Lord Hoffmann in paragraphs 65-66 , be incongruous for the courts to treat it as a domestic crime without specific statutory authority . 	lord mance	lord hoffmann	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	541	104 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	542	The incongruity would be underlined by the exclusion from the International Criminal Court Act 2001 of any reference to the crime of aggression , a point which is not undermined by the fact that the International Criminal Court 's present lack of jurisdiction over crimes of aggression is itself probably attributable to the international community 's inability to reach agreement on the pre-conditions for bringing any charges relating to such crimes before that court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	543	105 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	544	I therefore agree that the public international law crime of aggression is not a crime or offence under domestic law , and so not a crime for the purpose of section 3 of the 1967 Act or an offence for the purpose of the 1994 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	545	106 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
209	546	I also agree with Lord Hoffmann 's remarks in paragraphs 70 to 94 on the limits of self-help in the context of section 3 of the 1967 Act . 	lord mance	lord hoffmann	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hoffmann
