49	14	LORD MILLETT 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord millett, lord walker
49	15	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord millett, lord walker
49	16	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord millett, lord walker
49	17	Ms Mulkerrins claims damages from her former professional advisers PricewaterhouseCoopers -LRB- `` PwC '' -RRB- for having negligently failed to protect her from bankruptcy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord millett, lord walker
49	18	Her claim has yet to be tried and her allegations have not been established . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	19	Even allowing for this , however , she has been shamefully ill-served by her former advisers , by the law of insolvency , and by the civil justice system . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	20	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	21	At the beginning of the story Ms Mulkerrins owned a freehold property where she ran a small but profitable business as the proprietor of a nursing home . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	22	She faced the prospect of bankruptcy as a result of the failure of a business which she and her husband had formerly carried on together . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	23	The situation was tailor-made for an individual voluntary arrangement -LRB- `` IVA '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	24	Bankruptcy would destroy the business and yield relatively little for the creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	25	An IVA , on the other hand , would preserve the business and enable the creditors to receive payments from the income of the nursing home . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	26	She consulted PwC , who were licensed insolvency practitioners , and on their advice made all the necessary arrangements to enter into an IVA with a view to avoiding bankruptcy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	27	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	28	Despite this Ms Mulkerrins has been made bankrupt and the nursing home has been closed down by the Official Receiver , who did not have the funds to carry it on . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	29	She alleges that this would not have happened but for PwC 's negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	30	Her attempts to obtain redress have been thwarted at every turn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	31	First , she had to fight off her trustee-in-bankruptcy , who somewhat implausibly claimed that her cause of action had vested in him for the benefit of the creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	32	She won that round when the district judge in the Reading County Court sitting in Bankruptcy ruled that her trustee had no interest in the claim -LRB- because her creditors had none -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	33	He did not appeal and she duly brought proceedings against PwC . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	34	They strongly objected to being sued by their own former client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	35	Taking advantage of their own alleged wrong in failing to take the necessary steps to prevent her bankruptcy in the first place they insisted that , now that she had become bankrupt , they should be sued by her trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	36	This was more than a little impudent , even brazen . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	37	It meant that Ms Mulkerrins had to fight the same battle all over again . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	38	She effectively won again before the deputy judge in the High Court -LRB- -LSB- 2000 -RSB- BPIR 506 -RRB- , but PwC had greater determination -LRB- or resources -RRB- than the trustee , and this time she was taken to the Court of Appeal -LRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- BPIR 106 -RRB- , where she lost . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	39	Her action has been struck out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	40	She has now been discharged from bankruptcy and the trustee has been released , with the result that the Official Receiver has become trustee in his place : see section 300 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Insolvency Act 1986 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	41	He is under the trustee 's ordinary duty to realise the assets of the bankrupt estate for the benefit of the creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	42	Relying on the decision of the Court of Appeal he has conducted an auction of Ms Mulkerrins ' claim and proposes to distribute most of the proceeds to the creditors , despite the fact that they are bound by an order of the bankruptcy court that it is an asset in which they have no interest at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	43	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	44	Ms Mulkerrins has thus lost her business , had her claim for redress struck out , and faces the prospect of losing the value of her business for a second time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	45	But for an order of a district judge she would now be suffering the ultimate misfortune of being a party to a leading case in your Lordships ' House brought to resolve one of the more intractable problems in the law of insolvency . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	46	This is the problem which was recently considered by the Court of Appeal Ord v Upton -LSB- 2000 -RSB- Ch 352 namely to what extent does a `` hybrid '' claim of a bankrupt vest in his trustee on bankruptcy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	47	A hybrid claim is constituted by a single cause of action which is partly for personal injury or loss of reputation -LRB- to which the creditors are not entitled -RRB- and partly for financial loss -LRB- to which they normally are -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	48	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	49	Ms Mulkerrins claims damages for having been made bankrupt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	50	Her claim is a `` hybrid '' one , for she claims damages for loss of reputation as well as damages for loss of assets and earning capacity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	51	By far the greater part of her claim , however , is for financial loss arising from the closure of the business by the Official Receiver . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord walker
49	52	This would not have occurred but for the bankruptcy , and was a readily foreseeable and indeed virtually inevitable consequence of the making of the bankruptcy order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	53	She seeks to be placed in the financial position she would have been in if PwC had acted with proper skill and care and she had been made the subject of an IVA instead of a bankruptcy order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	54	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	55	The first question is : what was the effect of the order of the bankruptcy court ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	56	The dispute which it was called upon to decide was whether the chose in action which represented Ms Mulkerrins ' claim against PcW was an asset which had vested in the trustee for the benefit of the creditors or remained vested in Ms Mulkerrins for her own benefit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	57	The District Judge held that the trustee had no interest in the claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	58	In the High Court the deputy judge considered that this referred to the beneficial interest ; he held that the effect of the district judge 's order was that title to sue had vested in the trustee but he held it in trust for Ms Mulkerrins and not for the creditors : -LSB- 2000 -RSB- BPIR 506 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	59	This was rejected by the Court of Appeal : -LSB- 2001 -RSB- BPIR 106 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	60	Jonathan Parker LJ observed at para 61 that : '' ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	61	the district judge was not in any way concerned with accountability , or with the beneficial ownership of the cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	62	She was concerned only with the legal ownership : with the question - who can sue PwC ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	63	The district judge was not contemplating that the Trustee would be accountable for anything . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	64	She was contemplating that it would be Mrs. Mulkerrins who would sue , not the Trustee . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	65	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	66	This is true so far as it goes , but it is not the whole truth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	67	The district judge was certainly dealing with the legal title to the chose in action - the right to sue PwC . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	68	But she was not dealing with the bare legal title . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	69	She ruled that the trustee had no interest in the claim , and her reasoning shows that she meant no interest at all whether at law or in equity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	70	She considered that the claim had not vested in the trustee because it was not an asset which was available to the creditors , that is to say it was not part of the bankrupt estate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	71	She did not overlook the basic rule that , with few exceptions , the property of a bankrupt vests in his trustee for the benefit of his creditors ; or that at least so much of a chose in action as represents a claim to compensation for financial loss vests in him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	72	To her credit she recognised that Ms Mulkerrins ' claim was of an unusual kind , as neither the deputy judge nor the Court of Appeal seems to have done . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	73	It was a claim for damages for being made bankrupt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	74	As she put it , `` the bankruptcy itself is the cause of action '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	75	The district judge did not consider that a claim of this character could vest in the trustee for the benefit of the creditors ; though she seems to have considered that this was a matter of timing which made the cause of action after acquired property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	76	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	77	Both the deputy judge and the Court of Appeal thought that the district judge 's decision was wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	78	The cause of action did not arise after the bankruptcy order but in the same instant as the bankruptcy order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	79	The Court of Appeal distinguished between `` the Ord v Upton world '' , which they thought was the real world , and `` the artificial world '' created by the district judge 's order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	80	As between the parties to a judicial decision , however , it does not matter whether the decision is right or wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	81	As I observed in Crown Estates Commissioners v Dorset County Council -LSB- 1990 -RSB- Ch 297 , 305 res judicata -LRB- or to give it its full name estoppel per rem judicatam -RRB- is a form of estoppel which gives effect to the policy of the law that the parties to a judicial decision should not afterwards be allowed to re-litigate the same question , even though the decision may be wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	82	If it is wrong , it must be challenged by appeal or not at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	83	As between themselves , the parties are bound by the decision , and may neither re-litigate the same cause of action nor re-open any issue which was an essential part of the decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	84	The doctrine comes into its own only when the decision is wrong ; if it is right , it merely serves to save time and costs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	85	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord walker
49	86	The district judge 's order , therefore , bound the trustee and through him the creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	87	As between Ms Mulkerrins and the creditors , her claim against PwC and its proceeds belonged to her and did not form part of the bankrupt estate available to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	88	The Court of Appeal , with respect , overlooked the fact that , whatever world PwC inhabited , the trustee and the creditors lived in the world created by the district judge 's order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	89	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	90	PwC , of course , were not parties to the proceedings in the bankruptcy court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	91	They were not given notice of the proceedings and took no part in them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	92	They are not , therefore , bound by the order of the district judge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	93	But this does not mean that they can simply ignore it or that they are unaffected by it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	94	It means only that they can not be prejudiced by it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	95	They can not re-litigate the issue , not because it is res judicata as against them , but because they have no legitimate interest in doing so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	96	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	97	The general rule is that the benefit of a contract may be assigned to a third party without the consent of the other contracting party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	98	If this is not desired , it is open to the parties to agree that the benefit of the contract shall not be assignable by one or either of them , either at all or without the consent of the other party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	99	There is nothing objectionable in this ; a party is entitled to insist that he deal only with the particular party with whom he has contracted : see Linden Gardens Trust Ltd v Lenesta Sludge Disposals Ltd -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 85 , 105 , per Lord Browne-Wilkinson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	100	But unless he takes the precaution of including in the contract a prohibition of assignment , he has no right to object to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	101	A debt is freely assignable both at law and in equity without the debtor 's consent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	102	Section 136 of the Law of Property Act 1925 requires notice of the assignment to be given to the debtor if it is to be effective at law ; it does not require his consent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	103	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	104	An assignment of a claim for unliquidated damages in tort may be open to challenge on the grounds of maintenance and champerty ; but not on the ground that such an assignment needs the consent of the proposed defendant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	105	It is now established that a trustee may properly discharge his duty to obtain the best price for the assets of a bankrupt estate by assigning the bankrupt 's claim against a third party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	106	It is common ground that PwC could not have prevented the trustee from re-assigning Ms Mulkerins ' claim against them back to her had the district judge 's decision gone the other way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	107	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	108	The reason that the debtor 's consent is not required to an assignment of a debt is that the assignment can not prejudice him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	109	The assignment is subject to equities , which means that any set-off which the debtor may have against the assignor can be asserted against the assignee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	110	On bankruptcy the trustee is in no better position than his bankrupt ; a creditor 's right to sue his debtor vests in his trustee subject to equities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	111	It would have been inappropriate to allow PwC to take any part in the proceedings in the bankruptcy court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	112	They were brought to resolve a dispute between Ms Mulkerrins on the one hand and her creditors , represented by the trustee , on the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	113	PwC were debtors with an adverse interest to Ms Mulkerrins and her estate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	114	They could not be prejudiced by the vesting of Ms Mulkerrins ' claim vesting in her trustee ; and a fortiori they could not be prejudiced if it remained in her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	115	They had no legitimate interest in the question to be decided . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	116	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	117	In the event no question of assignment arose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	118	The district judge held that the claim did not vest in the trustee but remained vested in Ms Mulkerrins despite her bankruptcy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	119	PwC are being sued by their own former client , the very person to whom they owed a duty of care . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord walker
49	120	In the circumstances their protests have a very hollow ring to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	121	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	122	So far I have been content to assume that the decision of the district judge may have been wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	123	But it should not be assumed that it was . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	124	Ms Mulkerrins ' claim is an unusual one , for she complains of PwC 's failure to prevent the making of a bankruptcy order against her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	125	She claims damages representing the difference between her financial position as a result of the bankruptcy order and the financial position she would have enjoyed if she had entered into an IVA instead . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	126	Treating this claim as being wholly or mainly a claim in respect of financial loss , and even assuming that -LRB- contrary to the view of the district judge -RRB- it was not after-acquired property , it would be very surprising if a claim of this character could be made available to the creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	127	They would be claiming damages for the making of the very bankruptcy order under which their claim arose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	128	The greater part of their claim would represent damages for the closure of the nursing home , even though it was a going concern when it supposedly vested in the Official Receiver and was closed down by him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	129	The creditors have received the full value of the bankrupt estate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	130	The damages which Ms Mulkerrins claims represent the value of what she lost by the making of the bankruptcy order ; but while this could have been available to the creditors under an IVA , it could never have been made available to them in a bankruptcy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	131	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	132	The Court of Appeal assumed that the claim vested in the trustee because it was wholly or largely a claim for financial loss , without considering the particular nature of the claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	133	The question has not been argued before us and is not covered by authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	134	I prefer to express no concluded view upon it , but to leave it open for decision when the need arises , while expressing the view that it should not be taken to be concluded by the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	135	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	136	It is sufficient to dispose of this case by saying that , right or wrong , the district judge 's order bound the trustee and through him the creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	137	Ms Mulkerrins ' claim must be taken to form no part of the bankrupt estate available to her creditors , and she is at liberty to pursue it in her own name and for her own benefit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	138	In agreement with my noble and learned friend , Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe , whose speech I have had the advantage of reading in draft and with which I agree , I would allow the appeal . 	lord millett	lord walker	ackn	0.4	lord millett, lord walker

49	146	LORD WALKER OF GESTINGTHORPE 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	147	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	148	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	149	On the making of a bankruptcy order the bankrupt 's estate vests automatically in the trustee in bankruptcy as soon as he becomes trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	150	The bankrupt 's estate is widely defined , subject to some exceptions -LRB- including business equipment and household necessities -RRB- as comprising : `` all property belonging to or vested in the bankrupt at the commencement of the bankruptcy '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	151	Property is widely defined as including `` money , goods , things in action , land and every description of property wherever situated and also obligations and every description of interest , whether present or future or vested or contingent , arising out of , or incidental to , property '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	152	That is the effect of sections 283 , 306 and 436 of the Insolvency Act 1986 , which replaced similar but by no means identical provisions in a succession of earlier statutes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	153	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord walker
49	154	However , the wide language used in successive statutes to describe the bankrupt 's estate was from an early stage interpreted by the court as excluding rights of action which are classified as personal to the bankrupt , rather than relating to his property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	155	The most notable early case was the decision of your Lordships ' House in Beckham v. Drake -LRB- 1849 -RRB- 2 HL Cas 579 , but the report of counsel 's argument in that case refers to numerous authorities going back to the time of Lord Mansfield . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	156	The point was explained as follows by Erle J , one of the judges who advised the House -LRB- at page 604 -RRB- , `` This was an action on a contract for hiring and service , whereby the plaintiff was to serve for seven years , and the defendant to pay weekly wages during that time ; and the breach was a dismissal during the seven years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	157	The plaintiff , after this breach , and before the commencement of the action , became bankrupt ; and the question is , whether this cause of action passed from the plaintiff to his assignees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	158	The general principle is , that all rights of the bankrupt which can be exercised beneficially for the creditors do so pass , and the right to recover damages may pass though they are unliquidated ... This principle is subject to exception . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	159	The right of action does not pass where the damages are to be estimated by immediate reference to pain felt by the bankrupt in respect of his body , mind or character , and without immediate reference to his rights of property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	160	Thus it has been laid down that the assignees can not sue for breach of promise of marriage , for criminal conversation , seduction , defamation , battery , injury to the person by negligence , as by not carrying safely , not curing , not saving from imprisonment by process of law ... '' 23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	161	The line of authority includes the decision of your Lordships ' House in Wilson v United Counties Bank Ltd -LSB- 1920 -RSB- AC 102 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	162	Major Wilson had left England on active service soon after the beginning of the first world war , leaving his business affairs -LRB- which seem to have been in a fairly precarious state -RRB- in the hands of his bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	163	The jury found that the bank had failed in its duty to supervise his business affairs and to take reasonable steps to maintain his credit and reputation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	164	Major Wilson was made bankrupt and he and his trustee in bankruptcy joined in an action against the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	165	The jury awarded damages of about # 45,000 for depreciation in the bankrupt 's business and estate caused by the bank 's negligence -LRB- although the House was not unanimous as to whether this finding was justified on the evidence -RRB- and # 7,500 for damage to his credit and reputation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	166	The former sum was recoverable by the trustee in bankruptcy , and the latter by the bankrupt personally , even though -LRB- as Lord Atkinson observed at page 128 -RRB- the damages arose from the same breach of contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	167	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	168	Wilson v United Counties Bank Ltd can therefore be described as a hybrid claim , the term used by Aldous LJ in Ord v Upton -LSB- 2000 -RSB- Ch 352 , 366 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	169	That case was concerned with a claim which a bankrupt labourer -LRB- aged 30 at the time of his bankruptcy -RRB- brought against a doctor who had treated him , some years before his bankruptcy , for back pain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	170	Liability was admitted and the claim was substantial , including over # 170,000 for loss of past earnings and over # 730,000 for loss of future earnings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	171	The Court of Appeal , following the decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia in re Bell -LRB- a bankrupt -RRB- -LSB- 1998 -RSB- BPIR 26 , held that both parts of the claim for loss of earnings formed part of the estate , and that Mr Ord himself was entitled only to the damages for pain and suffering . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	172	Aldous LJ -LRB- with whom Kennedy and Mantell LJJ agreed -RRB- summarised the decision as follows -LRB- at page 371 -RRB- , `` The authorities are only consistent with the conclusion that the trustee is entitled to the damages for past and future loss of earnings and is not entitled to the damages for pain and suffering . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	173	As there is a single cause of action , it vested in the trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	174	There is in my view nothing in that conclusion which imposes practical difficulties with which the law can not deal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	175	The trustee as constructive trustee would have to account to the bankrupt for the property which he obtained inadvertently or by arrangement in an action which vested in him for the benefit of the creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	176	The idea that the cause of action should vest in the bankrupt would not be acceptable and compulsory joinder of both could lead to difficulties when the claim for loss of earnings was small compared with the potential costs of the litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	177	In such a case the trustee , if the cause of action vested in him , would have to consider carefully his duty to the bankrupt and would probably , if requested , assign the cause of action to him '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	178	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	179	The most recent authority is the decision of the Court of Appeal in Grady v HM Prison Service -LSB- 2003 -RSB- EWCA Civ 527 , 11 April 2003 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	180	It concerned a claim for unfair dismissal made by an administrative officer who had been a bankrupt about a year after the termination of her employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	181	The Court of Appeal -LRB- in a judgment of the court delivered by Sedley LJ -RRB- observed -LRB- at para 14 -RRB- that there is `` no bright line '' between personal rights of action and those which form part of a bankrupt 's estate , but -LRB- para 24 -RRB- that all the reasoning in the authorities `` tends to place on the non-vesting side of the line a claim which is primarily directed at the restoration of a contractual relationship in which the claimant 's skill and labour are the essential commodity '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	182	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	183	The Official Receiver , who was given leave to intervene in this appeal , has -LRB- both in his petition for leave and in his printed case -RRB- placed before your Lordships some thoughtful and well-researched submissions , including a helpful survey of Commonwealth and United States authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	184	He has drawn attention to the apparently anomalous results which can flow from accidents of timing of different stages in the prosecution of a right of action , and to the practical problems which may arise from a trustee in bankruptcy prosecuting a hybrid right of action , partly on behalf of the creditors and party on behalf of the bankrupt himself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	185	But in the event your Lordships did not find it necessary , and did not consider it appropriate to hear all argument on these points . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	186	That is because the very unusual facts of the present appeal permit it to be disposed of on much narrower grounds , and make it an unsuitable case for exploration of the wider issues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	187	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord walker
49	188	The appellant , Ms Barbara Mulkerrins , is an experienced state registered nurse . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	189	In 1995 she was separated from her husband -LRB- Mr Woodward , to whom she is no longer married -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	190	She was running a small nursing home in Berkshire providing specialised 24-hour care for four mentally disabled adults . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	191	Ms Mulkerrins was the sole proprietor of the business , and owned the freehold of the property , subject to a mortgage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	192	The residents were paid for by a care association , and the high level of fees -LRB- # 650 per resident per week -RRB- reflected the labour-intensive nature of the business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	193	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	194	Considered on its own , the nursing home was financially viable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	195	But Ms Mulkerrins had outstanding debts , for which she and her husband were both liable , in connection with a property business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	196	On 25 October 1994 a builders ' merchant presented a bankruptcy petition against Ms Mulkerrins in the Reading County Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	197	After some adjournments it was due to be heard on 26 June 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	198	Ms Mulkerrins consulted insolvency practitioners , Coopers & Lybrand , now PriceWaterhouseCoopers -LRB- `` PwC '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	199	Mr Rutlen of PwC advised her to apply to the county court for an individual voluntary arrangement -LRB- `` IVA '' -RRB- under Part VIII of the Insolvency Act 1968 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	200	He advised that she had a good chance of obtaining an IVA under which she would for a period of three years pay to her creditors # 500 a month out of the profits of the nursing home business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	201	Ms Mulkerrins accepted that advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	202	She paid PwC an amount on account of their charges and PwC undertook to prepare an IVA proposal with a partner in PwC as the nominee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	203	PwC attended the hearing on 26 June 1995 and an interim order was made suspending the bankruptcy proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	204	The petition was adjourned to the next open date -LRB- subsequently fixed as Monday 21 August -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	205	An application to continue the interim order was to be made on Friday 18 August . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	206	The nominee was required to lodge a report with the court by Wednesday 16 August . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	207	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	208	Then , as the deputy judge -LRB- Mr Jules Sher QC -RRB- said in his judgment -LRB- -LSB- 2000 -RSB- BPIR 506 , 508 -RRB- disaster struck . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	209	Ms Mulkerrins was due to go to Ireland for about a fortnight for a family reunion on the 25th anniversary of her father 's death . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	210	Her case -LRB- which PwC denies -RRB- is that she asked Mr Rutlen whether she should attend court on either the Friday or the Monday and was told that it was unnecessary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	211	She went to Ireland . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	212	PwC did not lodge the nominee 's report on the Wednesday . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	213	It reached the court by post on the Thursday -LRB- with a letter stating that the nominee did not propose to attend , but requesting continuation of the interim order -RRB- but these documents did not get placed before the district judge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	214	On Friday 18 August no one appeared and the district judge discharged the interim order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	215	On Monday 21 August there was again no appearance , and Ms Mulkerrins was adjudicated bankrupt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	216	She heard this news by telephone on Thursday 24 August . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	217	By then the Official Receiver had learnt of the existence of the nursing home -LRB- which was apparently unknown to the petitioner -RRB- and had visited it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	218	He formed the view that the business must be closed down at once . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	219	He arranged with Berkshire Social Services for the residents to be moved to other accommodation and on the afternoon of 23 August he obtained an order from the district judge authorising him `` in the absence of the bankrupt '' to close down the business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	220	The order records that the district judge heard representations by telephone from solicitors instructed by PwC . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	221	The residents were moved out on 24 August . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord walker
49	222	There was subsequently an application -LRB- paid for by PwC -RRB- to annul the bankruptcy order , but it failed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	223	In any case the nursing home business had by then effectively ceased to exist . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	224	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	225	Naturally enough , Ms Mulkerrins was extremely upset . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	226	She wished to sue PwC for breach of their professional duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	227	Towards the end of 1995 Mr Blake of KPMG was appointed as her trustee in bankruptcy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	228	There were some without prejudice discussions between Ms Mulkerrins ' solicitors , Mr Blake , and PwC and its solicitors -LRB- particulars of these discussions were ordered to be struck out of Ms Mulkerrins ' reply -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	229	But nothing significant came of them and on 19 August 1998 -LRB- just before her discharge from bankruptcy -RRB- Ms Mulkerrins issued a writ against PwC . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	230	Her statement of claim was served on 17 May 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	231	It claimed general damages for `` loss of status and business reputation '' and special damages for the loss of her assets , including the nursing home . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	232	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	233	The considerable interval between the issue of the writ and the service of the statement of claim is explained , at least in part , by discussions which took place between Ms Mulkerrins and Mr Blake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	234	Each claimed to be the proper person to prosecute the claim against PwC . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	235	In order to resolve the difference of opinion Ms Mulkerrins made an application to the Reading County Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	236	It was an ordinary application in her bankruptcy proceedings , made under section 303 of the Insolvency Act 1986 , sub-sections -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- of which provide as follows : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- If a bankrupt or any of his creditors or any other person is dissatisfied by any act , omission or decision of a trustee of the bankrupt 's estate , he may apply to the court ; and on such an application the court may confirm , reverse or modify any act or decision of the trustee , may give him directions or may make such other order as it thinks fit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	237	-LRB- 2 -RRB- The trustee of a bankrupt 's estate may apply to the court for directions in relation to any particular matter arising under the bankruptcy '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	238	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	239	There was a contested hearing before District Judge Henson on 3 February 1999 -LRB- that is , about 10 months before Ord v. Upton was decided by the Court of Appeal -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	240	Both sides were represented by counsel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	241	The district judge heard argument , adjourned for a short while to consider the matter and then gave judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	242	There is no official transcript but there is a full note prepared by the trustee in bankruptcy 's solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	243	A covering letter from the solicitor indicates that it was common ground between counsel that there could only be one cause of action in respect of the damage to her reputation and the financial loss , and that it was therefore a question as to whether the entire cause of action vested in the trustee in bankruptcy or in Ms Mulkerrins . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	244	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	245	The district judge 's reasoning is recorded as follows in the note : `` I have to say that I agree with the Applicant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	246	The bankruptcy itself is the cause of action and could not accrue until the bankruptcy order was made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	247	I do not think the argument that the cause of action arose before the bankruptcy order , as a result of which the bankruptcy order was inevitable , is convincing and I do not believe the definition of property can include the bankruptcy of this person '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	248	The relevant part of the order was the declaration that `` The Respondent has no interest in the following chose in action namely a right of action by the Applicant against Coopers & Lybrand -LRB- a firm -RRB- for personal injuries , loss and damage arising out of her bankruptcy which was caused by their negligence and breach of contract as licensed insolvency practitioners '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	249	The heading to the order as drawn up contains two errors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	250	It refers to section 303 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- rather than section 303 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- and it refers to the respondent as KPMG -LRB- rather than Mr Blake -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	251	But no one has suggested that either error casts any doubt on the substance of the order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	252	Mr Knowles QC -LRB- appearing in your Lordships ' House for PwC -RRB- accepted that `` no interest '' means what it says - that is no interest at all , legal or equitable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	253	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	254	There is no suggestion that this order was in any way collusive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	255	On the contrary , it was clearly made after vigorous argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord walker
49	256	It has never been appealed , probably because the trustee in bankruptcy had no funds available . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	257	At a hearing which took place before another district judge at the end of 2001 , it was suggested that the order of 3 February 1999 might be discharged or revoked under section 375 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Insolvency Act 1986 , which provides that every court with bankruptcy jurisdiction may review , rescind or vary any order made by it in the exercise of that jurisdiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	258	But it would be extraordinary to contemplate rescinding an order which has now stood for over four years , and has been acted on in litigation which has now reached your Lordships ' House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	259	Mr Davies QC for the Official Receiver very properly recognised that that is no longer a practical possibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	260	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	261	PwC were not given notice of the hearing on 3 February 1999 and did not know that it was taking place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	262	The first they heard of it was in a letter dated 1 April 1999 from Ms Mulkerrins ' solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	263	The absence of notice to PwC is at the heart of their submission that the order of 3 February 1999 was wrong , that it does not bind PwC , and that it should for practical purposes be ignored . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	264	The Official Receiver -LRB- who became involved in the matter again after Mr Blake 's discharge -RRB- did indeed appear to disregard the order in negotiations which he conducted , during 2001 , for the assignment of the cause of action in which -LRB- according to the order of 3 February 1999 -RRB- he had no interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	265	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	266	On 7 September 1999 PwC applied to strike out part of Ms Mulkerrins ' claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	267	This application overlapped a preliminary issue which had been directed by the Master . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	268	On the very eve of the hearing before the deputy judge the Court of Appeal handed down judgment in Ord v Upton . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	269	This led to rapid reassessment of both sides ' arguments and the enlargement of the scope of the strike-out application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	270	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	271	In his judgment the deputy judge referred to the two elements of Ms Mulkerrins ' claim as the personal loss and the financial loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	272	He was satisfied that PwC 's breach of contract -LRB- if eventually established at trial -RRB- occurred on Friday 18 August 1995 at the latest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	273	He rejected the submission that the right of action could be regarded as after-acquired property -LRB- which does not vest automatically in the trustee in bankruptcy but may be acquired by him under section 307 of the Insolvency Act 1986 , subject to the qualifications set out in that section -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	274	The deputy judge listed , and proceeded to reject , four arguments which had been relied on by Mr Krolick on behalf of Ms Mulkerrins -LRB- page 516 -RRB- : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- The decision of the Reading County Court in Bankruptcy is binding upon the defendants ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- In the alternative , it is an abuse of process to assert that the cause of action is vested in the trustee in bankruptcy ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- The defendants are estopped from denying the cause of action is vested in the claimants ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- The decision of the Reading County Court in Bankruptcy was correct , and the cause of action is vested entirely in the claimant '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	275	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	276	The deputy judge then turned to a fifth argument , which he himself had prompted -LRB- at page 520 -RRB- : `` Although , as I have held , the defendants are not bound by the Reading County Court judgment , the -LSB- trustee in bankruptcy -RSB- is ; and , once the time for appealing that judgment went by , the position as between the claimant and him became permanent and clear ; as between the two of them it was she who was entitled to the claim against the defendants and all the damages that might be awarded in pursuance of that claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	277	The corollary is that , as against the claimant , the -LSB- trustee in bankruptcy -RSB- was not entitled to such damages for the benefit of the creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	278	In short , once the time for appealing had gone by , the claimant 's beneficial entitlement to the claim against the defendants was unassailable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	279	The defendants are not bound by the judgment of the Reading County Court but they can not challenge the fact that it was made and the consequence that the claimant became beneficially entitled to the claim and its proceeds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	280	The same is not true of the legal title to the claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	281	That , as I have held , was vested in the -LSB- trustee in bankruptcy -RSB- and , as the defendants are not bound by the judgment , they remain entitled to assert , as they do of course assert , that the legal title remains vested in the -LSB- trustee in bankruptcy -RSB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	282	If he sued , and recovered , he would hold the proceeds upon trust for the claimant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	283	Even in the absence of the Reading County Court proceedings , he would have been a trustee of that part of such proceeds as represented damages in respect of the personal loss : see Ord v Upton . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	284	The effect of the Reading County Court judgment was to extend her beneficial entitlement from the damages in respect of the personal loss to all the damages recovered , irrespective of whether they represented personal or financial loss '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	285	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	286	The deputy judge then referred to the decision of Scott J in Weddell v Pearce & Major -LSB- 1998 -RSB- Ch 26 , and to some well-known authorities discussed by Scott J in his judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	287	The deputy judge concluded that Ms Mulkerrins ' proceedings were not a nullity , but that the Official Receiver should be joined as a defendant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	288	On that basis , he dismissed the strike-out application and determined the preliminary issue in favour of Ms Mulkerrins . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	289	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord walker
49	290	PwC appealed to the Court of Appeal -LRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- BPIR 106 -RRB- , which took the same view as the deputy judge had taken on the arguments raised in Ms Mulkerrins ' respondent 's notice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	291	But the Court of Appeal took a different view on what had become the main issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	292	Jonathan Parker LJ -LRB- with whom Kennedy and Laws LJJ agreed -RRB- referred in his conclusions -LRB- paragraph 60 -RRB- to what he called the Ord v Upton world , and then -LRB- in paragraph 61 -RRB- to what he called the artificial world of the Reading judgment -LRB- sc of 3 February 1999 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	293	He said , `` The difficulty with this -LSB- the deputy judge 's approach -RSB- , to my mind , is that the district judge was not in any way concerned with accountability , or with the beneficial ownership of the cause of action '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	294	That is so , up to a point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	295	On 3 February 1999 Aldous LJ 's judgment in Ord v Upton lay in the future , and the notion of a trustee in bankruptcy being accountable -LRB- as a constructive trustee -RRB- in respect of part of the recovery to be achieved by prosecuting a right of action was , I think , unheard of . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	296	But it is , with respect , incorrect to say that the district judge was not in any way concerned with the beneficial ownership of the right of action and -LRB- as the Lord Justice went on to say -RRB- that she was concerned only with legal ownership . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	297	The fact is that she was concerned with both legal and beneficial ownership , viewed globally and without any need for differentiation between them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	298	That was the all-or-nothing choice which counsel had placed before her as their agreed position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	299	Whether it was right or wrong , the order of 3 February 1999 clearly and decisively determined the issue between the only two possible contenders for the right of action against PwC . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	300	But the Court of Appeal treated it as an `` artificial world '' and concluded that the deputy judge 's reasoning was fallacious . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	301	The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal , determined the preliminary issue against Ms Mulkerrins , and dismissed her action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	302	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	303	In his oral submissions to your Lordships Mr Knowles concentrated -LRB- as I have already mentioned -RRB- on the fact that PwC had not had notice of the hearing on 3 February 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	304	He accepted that if the trustee in bankruptcy had made a legal assignment of his right of action to Ms Mulkerrins , or if Ms Mulkerrins had obtained the right to sue in the trustee 's name , PwC would have had to put up with the consequences , unwelcome though they were . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	305	But in the absence of such an assignment PwC could , he said , object to being faced with a claimant who has legal aid , and is likely to be unable to pay PwC 's costs if her claim ultimately fails . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	306	This potential problem about costs gave PwC a sufficient interest to give them standing to oppose the making of the order , had they known of the application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	307	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	308	In my opinion this submission is mistaken , for reasons which were explained by Lord Hoffmann in Stein v Blake -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 243 , 260 : `` It is a matter of common occurrence for an individual to become insolvent while attempting to pursue a claim against someone else . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	309	In some cases , the bankruptcy will itself have been caused by the failure of the other party to meet his obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	310	In many more cases , this will be the view of the bankrupt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	311	It is not unusual in such circumstances for there to be a difference of opinion between the trustee and the bankrupt over whether a claim should be pursued . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	312	The trustee may have nothing in his hands with which to fund litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	313	Even if he has , he must act in the interests of creditors generally and the creditors will often prefer to receive an immediate distribution rather than see the bankrupt 's assets ventured on the costs of litigation which may or may not yield a larger distribution at some future date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	314	The bankrupt , with nothing more to lose , tends to take a more sanguine view of the prospects of success . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	315	In such a case the trustee may decide , as in this case , that the practical course in the interests of all concerned -LRB- apart from the defendant -RRB- is to assign the claim to the bankrupt and let him pursue it for himself , on terms that he accounts to the trustee for some proportion of the proceeds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	316	It is understandable that a defendant who does not share the bankrupt 's view of the merits of the claim may be disappointed to find that notwithstanding the bankruptcy , which he thought would result in a practical commercial decision by an independent trustee to discontinue the proceedings , the action is still being pursued by the bankrupt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	317	His disappointment is increased if he finds that the bankrupt as plaintiff in his own name has the benefit of legal aid which would not have been available to the trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	318	Similar considerations apply to an assignment of a right of action by the liquidator of an insolvent company to a shareholder or former director . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	319	In such a case there is the further point that the company as plaintiff can be required to give security for costs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	320	The shareholder assignee as an individual can not be required to give security even if -LRB- either because he does not qualify or the Legal Aid Board considers that the claim has no merits -RRB- he is not in receipt of legal aid '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	321	Lord Hoffmann concluded that the systemic defect , if there was one , lay in the arrangements for legal aid and costs orders and not in the law of insolvency . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	322	His observations were directed to a different situation -LRB- where the trustee in bankruptcy assigned a right of action for financial loss which had undoubtedly vested in him -RRB- but they are also relevant to the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	323	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord walker
49	324	PwC 's grievance about its likely inability to recover its costs , if Ms Mulkerrins is ultimately unsuccessful , would not in my opinion have given it the right to be heard on the application under section 303 of the Insolvency Act 1968 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord walker
49	325	Under rule 7.7 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the Insolvency Rules 1986 the district judge could no doubt have directed that notice of the application should be given to PwC , but that would in my opinion have been a very unusual step to take . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord walker
49	326	The district judge can not be criticised for not having taken it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord walker
49	327	The hearing was an exercise of the court 's supervisory jurisdiction over the bankruptcy process , and PwC was a stranger to that process , with interests directly opposed to those of both the creditors and the bankrupt herself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord walker
49	328	Even if PwC had happened to be a creditor , the conflict of interest would have reduced their claim to be heard on a question of this sort -LRB- compare the practice of the Chancery Division on a summons to consider whether trustees should take proceedings against a defendant who happens to be a beneficiary , as explained in In re Moritz -LSB- 1960 -RSB- Ch 251 and In re Eaton -LSB- 1964 -RSB- 1 WLR 1269 ; and , on a comparable situation in the Companies Court , Smith v Croft -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 1988 -RSB- Ch 114 , 185-6 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord walker
49	329	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord walker
49	330	If -LRB- as I think -RRB- PwC had no right to be heard on the question of entitlement to the right of action , it is irrelevant that PwC was not bound by the district judge 's order in such a way as to create an estoppel per rem judicatam . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord walker
49	331	There is a statement in Spencer Bower , Turner and Handley , Res Judicata 3rd ed -LRB- 1996 -RRB- , p 130 , para 251 , that `` An English judicial decision which operates upon a thing by effecting a disposition of it determines its status and may be set up by , or against , any member of the English public , as conclusive in rem '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord walker
49	332	But it is simply not necessary to explore this difficult area . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord walker
49	333	In relation to the points raised in Mr Krolick 's respondent 's notice in the Court of Appeal it may be accepted that the order of 3 February 1999 was erroneous , and that it does not bind PwC by estoppel per rem judicatam or indeed by any other form of estoppel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord walker
49	334	But as the deputy judge said , the order certainly did bind the trustee in bankruptcy who was the only other possible contender for title to the right of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord walker
49	335	The substantial effect of the order was not to assign the right of action , but to declare that it had not been affected by the bankruptcy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord walker
49	336	From the moment that the right of action arose , it was at all material times in the legal and beneficial ownership of Ms Mulkerrins . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord walker
49	337	If the trustee in bankruptcy , as the only possible rival claimant , was bound by the order , its practical effect was not open to challenge by PwC . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord walker
49	338	46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord walker
49	339	It was not necessary for the deputy judge to direct that the Official Receiver -LRB- who is now performing the residual functions of the trustee in bankruptcy -RRB- should be joined as a defendant to the proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord walker
49	340	For these reasons and for the further reasons given in the speech of Lord Millett , with which I agree , I would allow the appeal and restore the deputy judge 's order , other than his direction for joinder of the Official Receiver . 	lord walker	lord millett	fullagr	1	lord millett, lord walker
49	340	For these reasons and for the further reasons given in the speech of Lord Millett , with which I agree , I would allow the appeal and restore the deputy judge 's order , other than his direction for joinder of the Official Receiver . 	lord walker	self	outcome	1	lord millett, lord walker
