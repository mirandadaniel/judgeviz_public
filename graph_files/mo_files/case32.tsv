32	8	LORD HOFFMANN 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
32	9	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
32	10	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
32	11	In the 1990s Morgan Grenfell -LRB- `` MG '' -RRB- marketed a simple tax avoidance scheme to create chargeable gains for clients who had available capital losses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
32	12	The gain arose out of a premium paid by MG for a long lease of property held by the client , which then took an underlease at a rack rent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
32	13	The efficacy of the scheme depended upon the client being able to deduct the rent and MG being able to deduct the premium as trading expenses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
32	14	The client 's position was uncontroversial but MG 's was more problematic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
32	15	MG contended that the long lease was a trading asset and that the premium was a payment on revenue account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	16	The Inland Revenue disagreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	17	It said that the purchase of the lease fell outside the scope of MG 's trading activities and that it was a capital asset . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	18	The premium was therefore a capital payment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	19	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	20	The issue was debated between MG 's tax advisers and the revenue in the case of a scheme which had been sold to Tesco . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	21	There is no dispute that MG were completely open about the way the scheme operated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	22	They did not conceal any relevant transactions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	23	But the inspector asked to see documents relating to the advice which MG had obtained from leading counsel and solicitors about whether the scheme would work . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	24	MG objected on two grounds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	25	First , that the documents were irrelevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	26	They would show no more than the opinions of the lawyers about the legal effect of transactions which had been fully disclosed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	27	The second was that they were protected by legal professional privilege -LRB- `` LPP '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	28	The inspector invoked his power under section 20 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Taxes Management Act 1970 -LRB- as substituted by section 57 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of and Schedule 6 to the Finance Act 1976 and amended by section 142 of the Finance Act 1989 -RRB- : `` Subject to this section , an inspector may by notice in writing require a person ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	29	-LRB- a -RRB- to deliver to him such documents as are in the person 's possession or power and as -LRB- in the inspector 's reasonable opinion -RRB- contain , or may contain , information relevant to ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	30	-LRB- i -RRB- any tax liability to which the person is or may be subject , or -LRB- ii -RRB- the amount of any such liability ... '' 4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	31	On 28 September 1999 the inspector issued a notice under the section , demanding a wide range of documents relating to the advice MG had sought and received in connection with the Tesco transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	32	MG issued judicial review proceedings to quash the notice on the grounds of ultra vires , contending , first , that the documents could not reasonably be thought to contain relevant information and secondly , that the Act upon its true construction did not entitle the inspector to require delivery of documents subject to LPP . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	33	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	34	The Divisional Court -LRB- Buxton LJ and Penry-Davey J -RRB- rejected both arguments and dismissed the application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	35	On the first point , the court accepted that the inspector could reasonably consider that the `` perception '' of the transactions by MG and its advisers revealed by the documents might throw light on whether they formed part of MG 's ordinary trading activities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	36	On the second , they held that the general terms of section 20 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- `` such documents as are in the person 's possession or power '' -RRB- could not be qualified to exclude documents subject to LPP . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	37	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	38	In the Court of Appeal -LRB- Schiemann and Sedley LJJ and Blackburne J -RRB- MG did not pursue the first point and the Court of Appeal agreed with the Divisional Court on the second . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	39	It is solely on the construction of the Act that MG appeal to your Lordships ' House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	40	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	41	Two of the principles relevant to construction are not in dispute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	42	First , LPP is a fundamental human right long established in the common law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	43	It is a necessary corollary of the right of any person to obtain skilled advice about the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	44	Such advice can not be effectively obtained unless the client is able to put all the facts before the adviser without fear that they may afterwards be disclosed and used to his prejudice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
32	45	The cases establishing this principle are collected in the speech of Lord Taylor of Gosforth CJ in R v Derby Magistrates Court , Ex p B -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 487 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	46	It has been held by the European Court of Human Rights to be part of the right of privacy guaranteed by article 8 of the Convention -LRB- Campbell v United Kingdom -LRB- 1992 -RRB- 15 EHRR 137 ; Foxley v United Kingdom -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 31 EHRR 637 -RRB- and held by the European Court of Justice to be a part of Community law : A M & S Europe Ltd v Commission of the European Communities -LRB- Case 155/79 -RRB- -LSB- 1983 -RSB- QB 878 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	47	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	48	Secondly , the courts will ordinarily construe general words in a statute , although literally capable of having some startling or unreasonable consequence , such as overriding fundamental human rights , as not having been intended to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	49	An intention to override such rights must be expressly stated or appear by necessary implication . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	50	The speeches of Lord Steyn and myself in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex p Simms -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 2 AC 115 contain some discussion of this principle and its constitutional justification in the context of human rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	51	But the wider principle itself is hardly new . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	52	It can be traced back at least to Stradling v Morgan -LRB- 1560 -RRB- 1 Pl 199 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	53	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	54	Section 20 -LRB- 1 -RRB- contains no express reference to LPP and the question is therefore whether its exclusion must necessarily be implied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	55	For this purpose it is necessary to examine section 20 -LRB- 1 -RRB- in its context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	56	It was first enacted as part of a group of sections dealing with the powers of tax authorities to obtain information , inserted into the 1970 Act by section 57 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of and Schedule 6 to the Finance Act 1976 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	57	These sections have since been amended and amplified on a number of occasions but the revenue do not suggest that the amendments have changed the meaning which the relevant words in section 20 -LRB- 1 -RRB- had in 1976 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	58	It is therefore sufficient to consider the 1976 provisions , the material part of which are for convenience reproduced as an appendix to this opinion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	59	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	60	The argument for the revenue is essentially that Parliament has provided a number of specific safeguards and restrictions for the protection of the taxpayer , including an express preservation of LPP for documents in the possession of a barrister , advocate or legal adviser . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	61	It therefore necessarily follows that no wider qualification of the general words of section 20 -LRB- 1 -RRB- was intended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	62	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	63	The first form of safeguard is some form of judicial or administrative control , graduated according to the intrusiveness of the power . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	64	Thus the inspector 's power to require delivery of documents under section 20 -LRB- 1 -RRB- or -LRB- 3 -RRB- requires the consent of a general or special commissioner : subsection -LRB- 7 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	65	Consent is not needed only if the Board of Inland Revenue itself makes the request under section 20 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	66	Likewise , only the Board may give a notice under section 20 -LRB- 1 -RRB- or -LRB- 3 -RRB- to a barrister , advocate or solicitor : section 20B -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	67	Notices to tax accountants under section 20A -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- see section 20A -LRB- 3 -RRB- -RRB- and searches under section 20C -LRB- 1 -RRB- require the consent or warrant -LRB- as the case may be -RRB- of `` the appropriate judicial authority '' , which in England means a circuit judge : section 20D -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	68	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	69	The second restriction is the preservation or creation by section 20B -LRB- 2 -RRB- of a limited form of litigation privilege in tax appeals , analogous to that enjoyed by a party to civil or criminal proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	70	A notice by an inspector under section 20 -LRB- 1 -RRB- or -LRB- 3 -RRB- can not require the taxpayer to produce `` documents relating to the conduct of a pending appeal by the -LSB- `` him '' -RSB- '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	71	For some reason which seems to me unclear , this privilege does not protect the taxpayer when the notice has been given by the Board : see R v Inland Revenue Commissioners , Ex p Taylor -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LRB- 1990 -RRB- 62 T.C. 578 , 593 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	72	It is in any case a litigation privilege which does not cover the same ground as -LRB- though it may overlap with -RRB- LPP . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	73	It applies to documents relating to the conduct of an appeal by , for example , a taxpayer in person , and not merely communications and documents relating to the obtaining of legal advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	74	On the other hand , it is confined the documents relating to a tax appeal , whereas LPP applies to legal advice whenever sought and for whatever purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
32	75	The distinction between LPP and litigation privilege is succinctly stated by Lord Denning MR in Buttes Gas and Oil Co v Hammer -LRB- No 3 -RRB- -LSB- 1981 -RSB- QB 223 , 243-244 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	76	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	77	The third restriction is that an inspector can not give notices under section 20 -LRB- 1 -RRB- or -LRB- 3 -RRB- or section 20A -LRB- 1 -RRB- to a barrister , advocate or solicitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	78	The decision to give such a notice must be taken at a higher administrative level , by the Board . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	79	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	80	Fourthly , by section 20B -LRB- 9 -RRB- , a tax accountant -LRB- defined by section 20D -LRB- 2 -RRB- to include anyone who assists someone else in the preparation of his tax returns or accounts and so possibly including a lawyer -RRB- can not be required by notice under section 20 -LRB- 3 -RRB- to deliver `` documents which are his -LRB- the accountant 's -RRB- property and originate as working papers of that relationship . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	81	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	82	Fifthly , sections 20B -LRB- 8 -RRB- and 20C -LRB- 3 -RRB- deal specifically with LPP , but only in relation to documents in the possession of the lawyer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	83	They can not be required to be delivered by a notice under section 20 -LRB- 3 -RRB- or 20A -LRB- 1 -RRB- without the client 's consent and they can not be seized or removed under section 20C -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	84	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	85	In my opinion the first four safeguards or restrictions are concerned with questions so distinct from LPP that they provide no basis for any implication that it was intended to be excluded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	86	The provisions for judicial or administrative control are intended to prevent abuse of the statutory powers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	87	In the present case , for example , the special commissioner who consented to the notice under section 20 -LRB- 1 -RRB- was required to be satisfied that `` in all the circumstances the inspector is justified in proceeding under this section '' : section 20 -LRB- 7 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	88	That involves a judgment as to whether the inspector was acting reasonably . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	89	It requires the special commissioner to balance the public interest that the inspector should have information needed to make a correct assessment against the interests of the taxpayer in not having his privacy invaded further than necessary : compare R v Inland Revenue Commissioners , Ex p T C Coombs & Co -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 2 AC 283 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	90	But LPP does not involve such a balancing of interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	91	It is absolute and is based not merely upon the general right to privacy but also upon the right of access to justice : see the R v Derby Magistrates ' Court , -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 487 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	92	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	93	The second restriction by reference to litigation privilege also gives rise to no implication about LPP . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	94	It may well give rise to the implication that no litigation privilege was to exist other than in the circumstances specified in section 20B -LRB- 2 -RRB- , as was held by the Court of Appeal in R v Commissioners of Inland Revenue , ex parte Taylor -LRB- No. 2 -RRB- -LRB- 1990 -RRB- 62 T.C. 578 , 593 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	95	But it has no bearing on LPP . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	96	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	97	The provision which requires that a notice to a barrister , advocate or solicitor should be given only by the Board does not in my opinion take the matter any further . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	98	It is entirely consistent with the preservation of LPP , which indeed is expressly preserved in such a case by section 20B -LRB- 8 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	99	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	100	Finally , section 20B -LRB- 9 -RRB- is a curious provision which appears designed to protect the proprietary interest of the tax accountant in his working papers : compare Chantrey Martin v Martin -LSB- 1953 -RSB- 2 QB 286 and Gomba Holdings UK Ltd v Minories Finance Ltd -LSB- 1988 -RSB- 1 WLR 1231 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	101	It has nothing to do with LPP . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	102	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	103	Although I appreciate that the revenue rely upon the inference to be drawn from the cumulative effect of these various provisions , I do not consider that even cumulatively they come anywhere near giving rise to an implication that LPP was intended to be excluded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
32	104	In my opinion , the revenue stand or fall by the express references to LPP in sections 20B -LRB- 8 -RRB- and 20C -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	105	If these are consistent with the preservation of LPP for documents in the hands of the taxpayer , the other provisions are no more than makeweights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	106	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	107	The argument for the revenue on sections 20B -LRB- 8 -RRB- and 20C -LRB- 3 -RRB- is simple . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	108	If Parliament intended to preserve LPP in general , why did it specifically provide for its preservation in respect of documents in the possession or power of a lawyer ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	109	The inescapable inference is said to be that LPP was not intended to be preserved for documents in the possession or power of the taxpayer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	110	This was the view of the Divisional Court , the Court of Appeal and also Bingham LJ in R v Inland Revenue Commissioners , Ex p Taylor -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LRB- 1990 -RRB- 62 T.C. 578 , 593-594 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	111	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	112	I see the force of this argument but I think that it has difficulties which were not fully addressed either in the Court of Appeal or in the Taylor case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	113	Why should Parliament want to preserve LPP for documents in the hands of the lawyer but not for documents -LRB- which may well be copies or originals of the same documents -RRB- in the hands of the taxpayer ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	114	The irrationality of such a scheme was commented upon by Advocate General Sir Gordon Slynn in A M & S Europe Ltd v Commission of the European Communities -LRB- Case 155/79 -RRB- -LSB- 1983 -RSB- QB 878 , 913-914 : `` If one considers the real purpose of the protection ... I can for my part see no justifiable distinction between such documents in the hands of the lawyer and in the hands of the client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	115	If the lawyer has one copy and the client another , both should be protected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	116	The request and the reply , if relating to legal advice , are of the same nature . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	117	To tell the client that if he leaves his documents at his lawyer 's office they will be protected , but that , if he keeps them himself , they are not seems to me indefensible and likely to encourage , eg the giving of oral advice if it is unfavourable advice , and the destruction or transfer to the lawyer 's office of documents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	118	It would be quite extraordinary that if the lawyer 's documents were , by chance , left at the client 's premises , the day the inspector called , they must be produced , but that if the lawyer took his file away with him , they would not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	119	In my opinion the rule covers communications between lawyer and client made for the purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice in whoever 's hands they are and whether legal proceedings have begun or not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	120	It covers also the contents of that advice -LRB- given orally or in writing -RRB- , in whatever form it is recorded - whether in a letter or in a summary or in a note or in minutes . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	121	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	122	Mr Brennan QC , for the Inland Revenue , said that there was no real anomaly because the inspector could indirectly obtain documents in the possession of the lawyer by applying to the taxpayer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	123	He would have to produce them on the ground that , although in the lawyer 's possession , he was entitled to them as against the lawyer and they were accordingly in his `` power '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	124	The purpose of section 20B -LRB- 8 -RRB- was to prevent the lawyer from being placed in a situation in which he had a statutory duty which conflicted with his duty to his client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	125	It eliminated conflict by providing that the duty to the client prevailed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	126	If the revenue wanted the documents , they had to serve a notice on the client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	127	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	128	I do not find this an adequate explanation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	129	If Parliament had simply wanted to spare lawyers the difficulty of deciding which master to serve , it could just as easily have removed the problem by providing that documents in the hands of lawyers also had to be produced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	130	Why should it have chosen to say that they could not be produced without the client 's consent ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	131	If the client 's consent is required when the documents are in the hands of the lawyer , why should it not be required when they are in the hands of the client himself ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	132	It seems to me strange to say that the lawyer could not produce the documents without the client 's consent , but leave it to be inferred that a client served with a notice under section 20 -LRB- 1 -RRB- would be obliged to give his consent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	133	The documents in the hands of the lawyer might be in the `` power '' of the client but then again they might not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
32	134	They might be attendance notes or similar documents belonging to the lawyer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	135	Or he might have a lien over them for his fees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	136	On any view , the revenue 's entitlement to the documents would be subject to chance events in the way Sir Gordon Slynn described . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	137	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	138	Despite these difficulties , one is bound to ask why Parliament should have dealt expressly with documents in the hands of the lawyer but not with those in the hands of the client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	139	LPP is , after all , a single privilege , for the benefit of the client , whether the documents are in his hands or that of his lawyer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	140	When the lawyer is served with a notice under section 20 -LRB- 3 -RRB- or 20A -LRB- 1 -RRB- , he has no privilege of his own but may , indeed must , assert that of his client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	141	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	142	I think that the explanation may lie in Parry-Jones v Law Society -LSB- 1969 -RSB- 1 Ch 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	143	The Law Society had a statutory power to make rules to enforce compliance with the Solicitors ' Accounts Rules and Solicitors ' Trust Accounts Rules and had made rules which entitled it for this purpose to require a solicitor to produce documents relating to his practice -LSB- or any trust -RSB- of which he was a solicitor trustee to an appointed investigator . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	144	Mr Parry-Jones objected to such a request on the ground that some of the documents contained confidential information relating to clients which could not be disclosed without their consent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	145	He issued a writ claiming an injunction to restrain the Law Society from proceeding with its request . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	146	Buckley J struck out the writ as disclosing no cause of action and his order was affirmed by the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	147	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	148	Lord Denning MR dealt with the matter as follows , at pp 6-7 : `` We all know that , as between solicitor and client , there are two privileges . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	149	The first is the privilege relating to legal proceedings , commonly called legal professional privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	150	A solicitor must not produce or disclose in any legal proceedings any of the communications between himself and his client without the client 's consent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	151	The second privilege arises out of the confidence subsisting between solicitor and client similar to the confidence which applies between doctor and patient , banker and customer , accountant and client , and the like . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	152	The law implies a term into the contract whereby a professional man is to keep his client 's affairs secret and not to disclose them to anyone without just cause ... This particularly applies in the relationship of solicitor and client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	153	The solicitor is not to disclose his client 's affairs to anyone at all except under the most special and exceptional circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	154	In reliance on these principles , Mr. Parry-Jones says that the accountant sent by the Law Society should not be allowed to see documents or information relating to a client 's affairs ... In my opinion the contract between solicitor and client must be taken to contain this implication : the solicitor must obey the law , and , in particular , he must comply with the rules made under the authority of statute for the conduct of the profession . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	155	If the rules require him to disclose his client 's affairs , then he must do so . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	156	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	157	Diplock LJ gave a judgment to similar effect , at p 9 : `` So far as Mr. Parry-Jones ' point as to privilege is concerned , privilege , of course , is irrelevant when one is not concerned with judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings because , strictly speaking , privilege refers to a right to withhold from a court , or a tribunal exercising judicial functions , material which would otherwise be admissible in evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	158	What we are concerned with here is the contractual duty of confidence , generally implied though sometimes expressed , between a solicitor and client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	159	Such a duty exists not only between solicitor and client , but , for example , between banker and customer , doctor and patient and accountant and client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	160	Such a duty of confidence is subject to , and overridden by , the duty of any party to that contract to comply with the law of the land . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	161	If it is the duty of such a party to a contract , whether at common law or under statute , to disclose in defined circumstances confidential information , then he must do so , and any express contract to the contrary would be illegal and void . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	162	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
32	163	Salmon LJ agreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	164	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	165	One could hardly imagine a stronger Court of Appeal , but I am bound to say that I have difficulty with the reasoning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	166	It is not the case that LPP does no more than entitle the client to require his lawyer to withhold privileged documents in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings , leaving the question of whether he may disclose them on other occasions to the implied duty of confidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	167	The policy of LPP requires that the client should be secure in the knowledge that protected documents and information will not be disclosed at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	168	The reasoning in the Parry-Jones case suggests that any statutory obligation to disclose documents will be construed as overriding the duty of confidence which constitutes the client 's only protection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	169	In the present proceedings , however , it is accepted that the client is protected by LPP and that this can be overridden only by primary legislation containing express words or necessary implication . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	170	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	171	It is unfortunate that the Court of Appeal was not referred to valuable judgments of the Supreme Court of New Zealand in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v West-Walker -LSB- 1954 -RSB- NZLR 191 , which reached the opposite conclusion in the context of a statutory power to require the production of documents and information for the purposes of the administration of the taxing statutes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	172	The New Zealand judges pointed out that LPP was not merely a rule of evidence but a substantive right founded on an important public policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	173	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	174	This is not to say that on its facts the Parry-Jones case was wrongly decided . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	175	But I think that the true justification for the decision was not that Mr Parry-Jones 's clients had no LPP , or that their LPP had been overridden by the Law Society 's rules , but that the clients ' LPP was not being infringed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	176	The Law Society were not entitled to use information disclosed by the solicitor for any purpose other than the investigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	177	Otherwise the confidentiality of the clients had to be maintained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	178	In my opinion , this limited disclosure did not breach the clients ' LPP or , to the extent that it technically did , was authorised by the Law Society 's statutory powers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	179	It does not seem to me to fall within the same principle as a case in which disclosure is sought for a use which involves the information being made public or used against the person entitled to the privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	180	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	181	In the light of the Parry-Jones case , it seems to me explicable that Parliament should wish to make it clear that even if the Court of Appeal was right in saying that the true basis for the client 's right to prevent his lawyer from disclosing documents concerned with obtaining legal advice to the tax authorities -LRB- or any other non-judicial authorities -RRB- was a duty of confidence rather than LPP , no such disclosure could be required under sections 20 -LRB- 3 -RRB- or 20A -LRB- 1 -RRB- without the client 's consent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	182	No such provision was of course required in the case of documents in the hands of the client himself , to which the duty of confidence was obviously irrelevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	183	Any protection to which such documents were entitled had to be based upon LPP and , so far as it existed , would be subject to the principle that it could be removed only by express language or necessary implication . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	184	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	185	Mr Brennan showed us the debates on the provisions which become Schedule 6 of the 1976 Act in Standing Committee E and on Report in the House of Commons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	186	He did not submit that they contained any material sufficiently unambiguous to be admissible under the principle in Pepper v Hart -LSB- 1993 -RSB- AC 193 but he produced them to show that the question of LPP was brought to the attention of the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	187	So it was , but I find no indication that the House was being told that the intention was to abolish or restrict it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	188	On the contrary , the Chief Secretary to the Treasury -LRB- Mr Joel Barnett -RRB- , with the Solicitor-General -LRB- Mr Peter Archer QC -RRB- in attendance , said to the Standing Committee -LRB- HC Debates -RRB- 10 June 1976 , Vol VI , col 686 : `` I should make it quite clear - even without my hon. and learned Friend sitting beside me - that the purpose of this part of the schedule is not to require privileged and confidential documents to be handed over to the Inland Revenue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	189	That is certainly not the intention . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	190	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	191	It is certainly true that some opposition amendments which were said to be intended to ensure that LPP was preserved were not accepted by the Government . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	192	But this was because they were thought -LRB- rightly or wrongly -RRB- either to go beyond the scope of LPP at common law or to be unnecessary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
32	193	The Parliamentary material does not therefore assist in showing a clear intention to override a fundamental human right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	194	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	195	I therefore do not think that the provisions upon which the revenue relies are sufficient to create a necessary implication that LPP was intended to be excluded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	196	This means that I respectfully think that the reasoning of Bingham LJ in R v Inland Revenue Commissioners , Ex p Taylor -LRB- No. 2 -RRB- -LRB- 1990 -RRB- 62 T.C. 578 , 593-594 was too broad . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	197	It suggests that because Mr Taylor was the taxpayer , any documents subject to LPP could have been demanded , whether the beneficiary of the LPP was the client or himself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	198	In my opinion , Mr Taylor would have been entitled to refuse to produce documents in respect of which he personally was entitled to LPP , such as legal advice from counsel about his own tax affairs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	199	But , as in Parry-Jones v Law Society -LSB- 1969 -RSB- 1 Ch 1 , I do not suggest that the actual decision was wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	200	In the Divisional Court the Inland Revenue accepted that , as the information was sought under section 20 -LRB- 2 -RRB- for the purpose of determining Mr Taylor 's own liability to tax , it could be used only for that purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	201	It could not , if subject to LPP , be used in connection with the tax liabilities of his clients . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	202	Glidewell LJ -LRB- at p 588 -RRB- accepted this concession as correct and although he suggested that the revenue might make other use of a discovery that a particular document existed , I am not sure that this is right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	203	It is not necessary to decide the point , but I do not think that the Inland Revenue were entitled to use any information supplied by Mr Taylor for another purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	204	In consequence , I do not think that the disclosure of the documents by Mr Taylor in confidence for the limited purpose of determining his own tax liability infringed any LPP vested in his clients . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	205	If I am wrong about this and technically it did , then I think that to that extent the statute can be construed as having authorised it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	206	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	207	On the other hand , I respectfully think that the decision of Millett J on a similar point in Price Waterhouse v BCCI Holdings -LRB- Luxembourg -RRB- SA -LSB- 1992 -RSB- BCLC 583 was wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	208	The question was whether LPP could be overridden by a notice given by the Bank of England under section 39 of the Banking Act 1987 requiring production of documents which it `` may reasonably require for the performance of its functions under this Act '' -LRB- section 39 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	209	The Act contained no express language excluding LPP but section 39 -LRB- 13 -RRB- provided that the section should not `` compel the production by a barrister , advocate or solicitor of a document containing a privileged communication made by him or to him in that capacity . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	210	Millett J said , at p 593 , that subsection -LRB- 13 -RRB- must be taken `` not only as making an exception to documents which may be required to be produced but also as marking the limits of that exception '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	211	The judge remarked that it might seem strange that `` the Bank of England should be unable to compel the production of documents from the lawyer when it can compel their production from his client '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	212	I agree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	213	But I do not think that the judge 's answer , namely that `` Parliament was not concerned to protect the interests of the client but those of the lawyer '' is at all adequate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	214	What are the interests of the lawyer ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	215	He has no interest in whether LPP is maintained or not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	216	If the client chooses to divulge the information , there is nothing the lawyer can do about it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	217	LPP is entirely in the interests of the client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	218	For the reasons I have already given in connection with section 20 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1970 Act , I do not think that the existence of subsection -LRB- 13 -RRB- was a sufficient ground for finding a necessary implication that LPP had been excluded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	219	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	220	The revenue say that it is important for them to have access to the taxpayer 's legal advice in those cases in which liability may turn upon the purpose with which he entered into a transaction or series of transactions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	221	This is particularly true of some of the anti-avoidance provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
32	222	But there are many situations in both civil and criminal law in which liability depends upon the state of mind with which something was done . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
32	223	Apart from the exceptional case in which it appears that the client obtained legal advice for the purpose of enabling himself better to commit a crime -LRB- R v Cox and Railton -LRB- 1884 -RRB- 14 QBD 153 -RRB- this is not thought a sufficient reason for overriding LPP . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
32	224	The court must infer the purpose from the facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
32	225	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
32	226	It is of course open to Parliament , if it considers that the revenue require such powers , to enact them in unambiguous terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
32	227	But there is also the Human Rights Act 1998 to be borne in mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
32	228	The appellants put forward an alternative submission that , if your Lordships agreed with the construction given to section 20 -LRB- 1 -RRB- by the Court of Appeal , you should make a declaration that it was incompatible with the right to privacy under article 8 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms -LRB- 1953 -RRB- -LRB- Cmd 8969 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
32	229	In the circumstances it is unnecessary for your Lordships to pronounce upon the point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
32	230	It is however the case , as I have mentioned , that the European Court of Human Rights has said that LPP is a fundamental human right which can be invaded only in exceptional circumstances : see Foxley v United Kingdom -LRB- 2001 -RRB- 31 EHRR 25 p 647 , para 44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
32	231	Mr Brennan said that the public interest in the collection of the revenue could provide the necessary justification but I very much doubt whether this is right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
32	232	Nor is it sufficient to say simply that the power is not used very often . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
32	233	That is no consolation to the person against whom it is used . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
32	234	If new legislation is passed , it will have to be seen whether it is limited to cases in which the interference with LPP can be shown to have a legitimate aim which is necessary in a democratic society . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann

32	245	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
32	246	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
32	247	I agree that this appeal should be allowed . 	lord hobhouse	self	outcome	0.8	lord hoffmann
32	248	The question to be decided falls within a very narrow compass and since this House is differing from unanimous decisions of the courts below I will shortly state in my own words my reasons for agreeing with the Opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann . 	lord hobhouse	lord hoffmann	fullagr	0.8	lord hoffmann
32	249	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
32	250	The question is one of statutory construction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
32	251	It is now accepted for the purposes of this litigation that the documents in respect of which the right to demand production remains in dispute contain or may contain information relevant to a tax liability to which Morgan Grenfell may be liable or its amount and that they are documents which are subject to legal professional privilege -LRB- advice privilege -RRB- which has not been waived . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
32	252	It is likewise accepted that the character of the privilege is that described in the speech of Lord Taylor of Gosforth in your Lordships ' House in Reg v Derby Magistrates ' Court , ex parte ` B ' -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 487 : its character is absolute and - ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	253	if a balancing exercise was ever required in the case of legal professional privilege , it was performed once and for all in the 16th century , and since then has applied across the board in every case , irrespective of the client 's individual merits . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	254	-LRB- p. 508 -RRB- At the least , some and , more probably , all of these premises would benefit from further examination but they have not been the subject of argument on the present appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	255	The question of construction is therefore whether the statute empowers the Revenue to require the delivery up to them of documents notwithstanding that they are covered by legal professional privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	256	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	257	The next step in the legal analysis is also not disputed and was expressly adopted by the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	258	The principle of statutory construction is succinctly stated in a quotation from the speech of Lord Hoffmann in ex parte Simms -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 2 AC 115 , at p. 131 : `` Parliamentary sovereignty means that Parliament can , if it chooses , legislate contrary to fundamental principles of human rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	259	... The constraints upon its exercise by Parliament are ultimately political , not legal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	260	But the principle of legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	261	Fundamental rights can not be overridden by general or ambiguous words . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	262	This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	263	In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary , the courts therefore presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	264	In this way the courts of the United Kingdom , though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament , apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	265	The context in which Lord Hoffmann was speaking was human rights but the principle of statutory construction is not new and has long been applied in relation to the question whether a statute is to be read as having overridden some basic tenet of the common law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	266	-LRB- Viscountess Rhondda 's Claim -LSB- 1922 -RSB- 2 AC 339 ; B v DPP -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 2 AC 428 -RRB- The protection given by the common law to those entitled to claim legal professional privilege is a basic tenet of the common law as has been reaffirmed by the case of ` B ' -LRB- sup -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	267	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	268	It is accepted that the statute does not contain any express words that abrogate the taxpayer 's common law right to rely upon legal professional privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	269	The question therefore becomes whether there is a necessary implication to that effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	270	A necessary implication is not the same as a reasonable implication as was pointed out by Lord Hutton in B v DPP -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 2 AC at 481 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	271	A necessary implication is one which necessarily follows from the express provisions of the statute construed in their context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	272	It distinguishes between what it would have been sensible or reasonable for Parliament to have included or what Parliament would , if it had thought about it , probably have included and what it is clear that the express language of the statute shows that the statute must have included . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	273	A necessary implication is a matter of express language and logic not interpretation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	274	46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	275	In the present case the statutory language falls a long way short of meeting this criterion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	276	The arguments advanced by the Revenue are fully discussed in the Opinion of my noble and learned friend . 	lord hobhouse	lord hoffmann	partagr	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	277	I agree with his conclusion . 	lord hobhouse	lord hoffmann	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	278	At best from the point of view of the Revenue the legislation is equivocal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	279	Left to myself I would incline to the view that the implication , if any , is that the Legislature was intending to preserve the legal professional privilege of the taxpayer rather than abrogate it ; otherwise , why preserve it in respect of documents in the hands of the adviser when the client has not consented to waive the privilege ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	280	Further , the argument that a general public interest in collecting revenue for the Executive suffices -LRB- in peace-time -RRB- implicitly to override the basic right and public interest represented by legal professional privilege is contrary to the authorities and the principles which the Revenue accept that those authorities lay down . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	281	47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
32	282	The present appeal thus falls to be decided applying the well-established principles of statutory construction to be found in English law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
32	283	The appellants do not need the assistance of the Human Rights Act or the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
32	284	The judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in Foxley v UK -LRB- 33274/96 -RRB- , 31 EHRR 25 , and the European Court of Justice in A M & S Europe v The Commission -LRB- Case 155/79 -RRB- , -LSB- 1983 -RSB- QB 878 , show a general recognition of the importance of legal professional privilege .
