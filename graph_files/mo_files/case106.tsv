106	4	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	5	The central question is whether a buyer , who employed a surveyor to investigate whether a property in the countryside was seriously affected by aircraft noise , may in principle recover non-pecuniary damages against the surveyor for the latter 's negligent failure to discover that the property was so affected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	6	The trial judge answered this question in the affirmative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	7	A two-member Court of Appeal disagreed on it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	8	The point was then re-argued before a three-member Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	9	By a majority the Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the trial judge and ruled that there was no right to recover non-pecuniary damages in such cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	10	The second Court of Appeal was deluged with authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	11	So was the House on the present appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	12	The hearings of what was a comparatively simple case took up an exorbitant amount of time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	13	This circumstance underlines the importance , in the quest for coherent and just solutions in such cases , of simple and practical rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	14	I. Riverside House , aircraft noise and the surveyor 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	15	In 1990 the plaintiff , a successful businessman , contemplated retirement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	16	He owned a flat in London , a house in Brighton and a property overseas . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	17	He wanted to buy a gracious country residence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	18	He became interested in a beautiful property known as Riverside House in the village of Blackboys in Sussex which was situated some 15 miles from Gatwick International Airport . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	19	The property is in the heart of the countryside . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	20	There is a stream running through the middle of it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	21	The property has a croquet lawn , tennis court , orchard , paddock and swimming pool . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	22	Although the attractive house required modernisation and refurbishment , it appeared to be ideal for the plaintiff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	23	There was , however , one question mark over the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	24	For the plaintiff a property offering peace and tranquillity was the raison d'Ãªtre of the proposed purchase . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	25	He wanted to be reasonably sure that the property was not seriously affected by aircraft noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	26	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	27	The plaintiff engaged as his surveyor the defendant , who had been in practice as a sole practitioner for some years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	28	The surveyor had to investigate the usual matters expected of a surveyor who inspects a property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	29	In addition the plaintiff also specifically asked the surveyor to investigate , amongst other things , whether the property would be affected by aircraft noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	30	The plaintiff told the surveyor that he did not want a property on a flight path . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	31	The surveyor accepted these instructions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	32	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	33	On 17 December 1990 the surveyor sent his report to the plaintiff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	34	From the plaintiff 's point of view it was a satisfactory report . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	35	About aircraft noise the surveyor reported : `` You have also asked whether we felt the property might be affected by aircraft noise , but we were not conscious of this during the time of our inspection , and think it unlikely that the property will suffer greatly from such noise , although some planes will inevitably cross the area , depending on the direction of the wind and the positioning of the flight paths . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	36	Comforted by this reassuring report the plaintiff decided to buy the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	37	The purchase price was # 420,000 -LRB- which included # 45,000 for chattels -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	38	The purchase was completed on 28 February 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	39	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	40	In the next few months the plaintiff caused the house to be modernised and refurbished at a total cost of about # 125,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
106	41	During this period he was unaware that there was a significant problem associated with aircraft noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	42	On 13 June 1991 the plaintiff and his partner -LRB- who had a 32.74 % beneficial interest -RRB- moved in . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	43	Since 1991 they had lived there three to four days a week for seven to nine months of the year . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	44	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	45	After he moved in the plaintiff quickly discovered that the property was indeed affected by aircraft noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	46	In fact , the property was not far away from a navigation beacon -LRB- the Mayfield Stack -RRB- and at certain busy times , especially in the morning , the early evening , and at weekends , aircraft waiting to land at Gatwick would be stacked up maintaining a spiral course around the beacon until there was a landing slot at the airport . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	47	Aircraft frequently passed directly over , or nearly over , the position of the house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	48	The impact of aircraft noise on the tranquillity of the property was marked . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	49	The property was undoubtedly affected by aircraft noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	50	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	51	It is common ground that the plaintiff 's enjoyment of the property was diminished by aircraft noise at those times when he was enjoying the amenities of the property outdoors and aircraft were stacked up , maintaining their spiral course around the beacon , waiting for a landing slot at the airport . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	52	Nevertheless , after initial vacillation , the plaintiff decided not to sell the property and he does not presently intend to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	53	II . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	54	The proceedings in the High Court 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	55	In due course the plaintiff claimed damages against the surveyor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	56	The action came for trial before Judge Peter Baker QC sitting as a judge of the Queen 's Bench Division in May 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	57	The action was resolutely defended by the surveyor on all aspects of the claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	58	The judge accepted the plaintiff 's account of his instructions to the defendant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	59	I have already set out the instructions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	60	The judge had to consider whether the defendant had been negligent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	61	It was clear that the surveyor could have discovered the true position by checking with Gatwick . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	62	He did not do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	63	The judge found that the surveyor had been negligent and that , if the surveyor had carried out his instructions properly , the plaintiff would not have bought the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	64	The judge 's conclusions on this aspect are not challenged on the appeal before the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	65	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	66	The principal claim was one for a diminution of value of the property by reason of the negative effect of aircraft noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	67	The judge found that the purchase price coincided with the open market value of the property after taking into account aircraft noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	68	He accordingly dismissed the principal claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	69	There is also no challenge to this part of the judgment at first instance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	70	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	71	The judge then had to consider the plaintiff 's claim for non-pecuniary damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	72	He accepted the evidence of Mr Attwood , a sound expert . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	73	The report of this expert summarised the general effect of the aircraft noise on Riverside House as follows : `` On a subjective basis , the aircraft noise , with its particular character , is out of keeping with the nature of the area around the house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	74	The grounds are in a very beautiful setting with many specimen trees and with a stream running through the middle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	75	The outlook is also very beautiful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	76	Essentially , this house and garden are in the heart of the countryside . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	77	The noise from the aircraft , flying overhead , represents a very significant intrusion into the peace of this setting . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	78	It is the opinion of the author that the aircraft noise represents a very significant nuisance to anyone trying to enjoy the amenity of the grounds at Riverside House . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	79	The judge approached the claim in accordance with the law as stated in Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	80	He upheld the plaintiff 's claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	81	`` Here I think one must bear in mind that this was a specific contract dealing , inter alia , with noise so far as the defendant is concerned , and I was impressed by the account that Mr Farley gave of a number of matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	82	Firstly , he is particularly vulnerable because he has a habit , practice , of being an early riser and of wishing , when clement weather conditions prevail as even in this country -LSB- they -RSB- occasionally do , to sit outside on his terrace , or wherever , and enjoy the delightful gardens , the pool and the other amenities which is made pretty intolerable , he says , and I accept from his point of view between , say , the hours of 6 o'clock and 8 o'clock in the morning which is the time when he would be minded to do this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	83	Likewise , pre-dinner drinks are not made the better for the evening activity in the sky not far away . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	84	That he is not a man , if I may say so , with excessive susceptibilities is shown by the fact that he did his best to grit his teeth and put up with it but , as he ultimately said , `` Why should I when I had endeavoured to cover this particular point in the instructions that I had given to a professional man whom I had paid to do this ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	85	He finds it a confounded nuisance , and this is a matter that , of course , he will be stuck with . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	86	It is not a case of something like drains or dry rot or what have you that he can do anything about . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	87	Short of buying Gatwick and closing it down , this is a matter that will continue . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	88	-LRB- Emphasis added -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	89	For what he described as the discomfort that had been sustained by the plaintiff the judge awarded # 10,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	90	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	91	Immediately after this judgment was given counsel for the defendant invited the judge to deal specifically with one of his arguments , viz that the plaintiff 's claim must be rejected because he had decided not to move house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	92	The judge dealt with this point as follows : `` Bingham LJ said in Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 , 1445 : ` If , on learning of the defects which should have been but were not reported , a purchaser decides , for whatever reason , to retain the house and not move out and sell , I would question whether any loss he thereafter suffers , at least in the ordinary case , can be laid at the door of the contract-breaker . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	93	Dealing with that , in my judgment this is not an ordinary case because if you look how matters worked out , Mr Farley , not knowing at the time of the defect of which he should have been informed , on my judgment , thereafter incurred vast expense in altering the house to get it to a much higher standard . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	94	I think the sum of # 100,000-odd was mentioned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	95	It was a very large sum . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	96	It seems to me , he not learning of the matters which I find -LSB- in -RSB- my judgment in this case until much later than he incurred that expense , it seems to me it would be putting too high a burden to say that he should then have decided to move and to get away from the nuisance , if I may so describe it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	97	That nuisance being , for obvious reasons , not one that one can do anything about . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	98	It is not a structural defect that can be remedied , and that therefore he made the best of a bad job and stayed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	99	I think in my judgment with the greatest deference , what Bingham LJ was saying was , in my view obiter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	100	He should not be penalised for not having done that . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	101	Thank you for reminding me of that matter . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	102	The judge 's decision on the claim for non-pecuniary damages therefore stood . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	103	III . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	104	The proceedings in the Court of Appeal 12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	105	The surveyor appealed to the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	106	In November 1999 the matter came before Judge and Hale LJJ . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	107	The issue was whether as a matter of law the judge was entitled to make the award of non-pecuniary damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	108	The members of the court disagreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	109	Judge LJ thought that the judge 's decision was correct and he would have dismissed the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	110	Hale LJ took the opposite view and would have allowed the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	111	For her the insuperable obstacle was that the surveyor had not guaranteed a result but had only undertaken a duty to exercise reasonable care . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	112	In the result the matter had to be re-argued . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	113	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	114	In March 2000 the matter came before a three-member Court of Appeal -LSB- 2000 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep PN 516 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	115	In separate judgments the majority -LRB- Stuart-Smith and Mummery LJJ -RRB- held that the award of non-pecuniary damages was contrary to principle and allowed the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	116	In a detailed and powerful judgment Clarke LJ dissented . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	117	Stuart-Smith LJ concluded that the judge made the award on the ground that the breach of contract caused physical inconvenience and discomfort to the plaintiff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	118	He found that the evidence did not justify this conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	119	He further held that the case fell beyond the reach of the exceptional category where the very object of the contract is to provide pleasure , relaxation , or peace of mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	120	He did so essentially for two separate reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
106	121	First , in his view the particular obligation to investigate aircraft noise was `` simply one relatively minor aspect of the overall instructions '' -LRB- p 521 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	122	Secondly , there was not `` an obligation to achieve a result '' -LRB- p 523 -RRB- but a mere obligation to exercise reasonable care . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	123	Mummery LJ agreed with Stuart-Smith LJ and reinforced his reasoning by reference to policy considerations of incommensurability , subjectivity and difficulties of proof involved in claims for mental distress flowing from breach of contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	124	IV . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	125	The law 14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	126	The judgments in the Court of Appeal and the arguments before the House took as their starting point the propositions enunciated by Bingham LJ in Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	127	In that case the Court of Appeal had to consider a claim for damages for distress and inconvenience by a buyer of a house against his surveyor who had negligently failed to report defects in the house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	128	Bingham LJ observed , at p 1445 : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- A contract-breaker is not in general liable for any distress , frustration , anxiety , displeasure , vexation , tension or aggravation which his breach of contract may cause to the innocent party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	129	This rule is not , I think , founded on the assumption that such reactions are not foreseeable , which they surely are or may be , but on considerations of policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	130	-LRB- 2 -RRB- But the rule is not absolute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	131	Where the very object of a contract is to provide pleasure , relaxation , peace of mind or freedom from molestation , damages will be awarded if the fruit of the contract is not provided or if the contrary result is procured instead . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	132	If the law did not cater for this exceptional category of case it would be defective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	133	A contract to survey the condition of a house for a prospective purchaser does not , however , fall within this exceptional category . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	134	-LRB- 3 -RRB- In cases not falling within this exceptional category , damages are in my view recoverable for physical inconvenience and discomfort caused by the breach and mental suffering directly related to that inconvenience and discomfort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	135	If those effects are foreseeably suffered during a period when defects are repaired I am prepared to accept that they sound in damages even though the cost of the repairs is not recoverable as such . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	136	But I also agree that awards should be restrained , and that the awards in this case far exceeded a reasonable award for the injury shown to have been suffered . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	137	-LRB- Numbering introduced -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	138	As Stuart-Smith LJ pointed out in the present case -LSB- 2000 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep PN 516 , 519-522 , the propositions of Bingham LJ have often been cited and applied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	139	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	140	But useful as the observations of Bingham LJ undoubtedly are , they were never intended to state more than broad principles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	141	In Broome v Cassell & Co Ltd -LSB- 1972 -RSB- AC 1027 Lord Reid commented , at p 1085 : `` experience has shown that those who have to apply the decision -LSB- Rookes v Barnard -LSB- 1964 -RSB- AC 1129 -RSB- to other cases and still more those who wish to criticise it seem to find it difficult to avoid treating sentences and phrases in a single speech as if they were provisions in an Act of Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	142	They do not seem to realise that it is not the function of judges to frame definitions or to lay down hard and fast rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	143	It is their function to enunciate principles and much that they say is intended to be illustrative or explanatory and not to be definitive . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	144	Bingham LJ would have had this truth about judicial decision making well in mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	145	So interpreted the passage cited is a helpful point of departure for the examination of the issues in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	146	Specifically , it is important to bear in mind that Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 was a case where a surveyor negligently failed to discover defects in a property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	147	The claim was not for breach of a specific undertaking to investigate a matter important for the buyer 's peace of mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	148	It was a claim for damages for inconvenience and discomfort resulting from breach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	149	In Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 therefore there was no reason to consider the case where a surveyor is in breach of a distinct and important contractual obligation which was intended to afford the buyer information confirming the presence or absence of an intrusive element before he committed himself to the purchase . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	150	V. Recovery of non-pecuniary damages 16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	151	The examination of the issues can now proceed from a secure foothold . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	152	In the law of obligations the rules governing the recovery of compensation necessarily distinguish between different kinds of harm . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	153	In tort the requirement of reasonable foreseeability is a sufficient touchstone of liability for causing death or physical injury : it is an inadequate tool for the disposal of claims in respect of psychiatric injury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	154	Tort law approaches compensation for physical damage and pure economic loss differently . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	155	In contract law distinctions are made about the kind of harm which resulted from the breach of contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	156	The general principle is that compensation is only awarded for financial loss resulting from the breach of contract : Livingstone v Rawyards Coal Co -LRB- 1880 -RRB- 5 AppCas 25 , 39 , per Lord Blackburn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	157	In the words of Bingham LJ in Watts as a matter of legal policy `` a contract breaker is not in general liable for any distress , frustration , anxiety , displeasure , vexation , tension or aggravation which his breach of contract may cause to the innocent party '' -LRB- my emphasis -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	158	There are , however , limited exceptions to this rule . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	159	One such exception is damages for pain , suffering and loss of amenities caused to an individual by a breach of contract : see McGregor on Damages , 16th ed , para 96 , pp 56-57 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	160	It is not material in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	161	But the two exceptions mentioned by Bingham LJ , namely where the very object of the contract is to provide pleasure -LRB- proposition -LRB- 2 -RRB- -RRB- and recovery for physical inconvenience caused by the breach -LRB- proposition -LRB- 3 -RRB- -RRB- , are pertinent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	162	The scope of these exceptions is in issue in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	163	It is , however , correct , as counsel for the surveyor submitted , that the entitlement to damages for mental distress caused by a breach of contract is not established by mere foreseeability : the right to recovery is dependent on the case falling fairly within the principles governing the special exceptions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	164	So far there is no real disagreement between the parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	165	VI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	166	The very object of the contract : The framework 17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	167	I reverse the order in which the Court of Appeal considered the two issues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	168	I do so because the issue whether the present case falls within the exceptional category governing cases where the very object of the contact is to give pleasure , and so forth , focuses directly on the terms actually agreed between the parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	169	It is concerned with the reasonable expectations of the parties under the specific terms of the contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	170	Logically , it must be considered first . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN

106	172	It is necessary to examine the case on a correct characterisation of the plaintiff 's claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	173	Stuart-Smith LJ -LSB- 2000 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep PN 516 , 521 thought that the obligation undertaken by the surveyor was `` one relatively minor aspect of the overall instructions . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	174	What Stuart-Smith and Mummery LJJ would have decided if they had approached it on the basis that the obligation was a major or important part of the contract between the plaintiff and the surveyor is not clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	175	But the Court of Appeal 's characterisation of the case was not correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	176	The plaintiff made it crystal clear to the surveyor that the impact of aircraft noise was a matter of importance to him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	177	Unless he obtained reassuring information from the surveyor he would not have bought the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	178	That is the tenor of the evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	179	It is also what the judge found . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	180	The case must be approached on the basis that the surveyor 's obligation to investigate aircraft noise was a major or important part of the contract between him and the plaintiff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	181	It is also important to note that , unlike in Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd -LSB- 1909 -RSB- AC 488 , the plaintiff 's claim is not for injured feelings caused by the breach of contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	182	Rather it is a claim for damages flowing from the surveyor 's failure to investigate and report , thereby depriving the buyer of the chance of making an informed choice whether or not to buy resulting in mental distress and disappointment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN

106	184	The broader legal context of Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 must be borne in mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	185	The exceptional category of cases where the very object of a contract is to provide pleasure , relaxation , peace of mind or freedom from molestation is not the product of Victorian contract theory but the result of evolutionary developments in case law from the 1970s . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	186	Several decided cases informed the description given by Bingham LJ of this category . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN

106	190	In the celebrated case of Jarvis v Swans Tours Ltd -LSB- 1973 -RSB- QB 233 , the plaintiff recovered damages for mental distress flowing from a disastrous holiday resulting from a travel agent 's negligent representations : compare also Jackson v Horizon Holidays Ltd -LSB- 1975 -RSB- 1 WLR 1468 .

106	200	At their Lordships ' request counsel for the plaintiff produced a memorandum based on various publications which showed the impact of the developments already described on litigation in the county courts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	201	Taking into account the submissions of counsel for the surveyor and making due allowance for a tendency of the court sometimes not to distinguish between the cases presently under consideration and cases of physical inconvenience and discomfort , I am satisfied that in the real life of our lower courts non-pecuniary damages are regularly awarded on the basis that the defendant 's breach of contract deprived the plaintiff of the very object of the contract , viz pleasure , relaxation , and peace of mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
106	202	The cases arise in diverse contractual contexts , eg the supply of a wedding dress or double glazing , hire purchase transactions , landlord and tenant , building contracts , and engagements of estate agents and solicitors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	203	The awards in such cases seem modest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	204	For my part what happens on the ground casts no doubt on the utility of the developments since the 1970s in regard to the award of non-pecuniary damages in the exceptional categories . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	205	But the problem persists of the precise scope of the exceptional category of case involving awards of non-pecuniary damages for breach of contract where the very object of the contract was to ensure a party 's pleasure , relaxation or peace of mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	206	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	207	An important development for this branch of the law was Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 344 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	208	The plaintiff had specified that a swimming pool should at the deep end have a depth of 7 feet 6 inches . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	209	The contractor failed to comply with his contractual obligation : the actual depth at the deep end was the standard 6 feet . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	210	The House found the usual `` cost of cure '' measure of damages to be wholly disproportionate to the loss suffered and economically wasteful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	211	On the other hand , the House awarded the moderate sum of # 2,500 for the plaintiff 's disappointment in not receiving the swimming pool he desired . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	212	It is true that for strategic reasons neither side contended for such an award . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	213	The House was , however , not inhibited by the stance of the parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	214	Lord Mustill and Lord Lloyd of Berwick justified the award in carefully reasoned judgments which carried the approval of four of the Law Lords . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	215	It is sufficient for present purposes to mention that for Lord Mustill , at p 360 , the principle of pacta sunt servanda would be eroded if the law did not take account of the fact that the consumer often demands specifications which , although not of economic value , have value to him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	216	This is sometimes called the `` consumer surplus '' : see Harris , Ogus and Philips , `` Contract Remedies and the Consumer Surplus '' -LRB- 1979 -RRB- 95 LQR 581 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	217	Lord Mustill rejected the idea that `` the promisor can please himself whether or not to comply with the wishes of the promisee which , as embodied in the contract , formed part of the consideration for the price '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	218	Lords Keith of Kinkel and Bridge of Harwich agreed with Lord Mustill 's judgment and with Lord Lloyd of Berwick 's similar reasoning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	219	Labels sometimes obscure rather than illuminate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	220	I do not therefore set much store by the description `` consumer surplus '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	221	But the controlling principles stated by Lord Mustill and Lord Lloyd are important . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	222	It is difficult to reconcile this decision of the House with the decision of the Court of Appeal -LSB- 2000 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep PN 516 in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	223	I will in due course return to the way in which the majority attempted to distinguish Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 344 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	224	At this stage , however , I draw attention to the fact that the majority in the Court of Appeal , at p 521 , regarded the relevant observations of Lord Mustill and Lord Lloyd as obiter dicta . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	225	I am satisfied that the principles enunciated in Ruxley 's case in support of the award of # 2,500 for a breach of respect of the provision of a pleasurable amenity have been authoritatively established . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	226	VII . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	227	The very object of the contract : The arguments against the plaintiff 's claim 22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	228	Counsel for the surveyor advanced three separate arguments each of which he said was sufficient to defeat the plaintiff 's claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	229	First , he submitted that even if a major or important part of the contract was to give pleasure , relaxation and peace of mind , that was not enough . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	230	It is an indispensable requirement that the object of the entire contract must be of this type . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	231	Secondly , he submitted that the exceptional category does not extend to a breach of a contractual duty of care , even if imposed to secure pleasure , relaxation and peace of mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	232	It only covers cases where the promiser guarantees achievement of such an object . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	233	Thirdly , he submitted that by not moving out of Riverside House the plaintiff forfeited any right to recover non-pecuniary damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	234	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	235	The first argument fastened onto a narrow reading of the words `` the very object of -LSB- the -RSB- contract '' as employed by Bingham LJ in Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1WLR 1421 , 1445 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	236	Cases where a major or important part of the contract was to secure pleasure , relaxation and peace of mind were not under consideration in Watts v Morrow . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	237	It is difficult to see what the principled justification for such a limitation might be . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	238	After all , in 1978 the Court of Appeal allowed such a claim in Jackson v Chrysler Acceptances Ltd -LSB- 1978 -RSB- RTR 474 in circumstances where a spoiled holiday was only one object of the contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	239	Counsel was , however , assisted by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Knott v Bolton -LRB- 1995 -RRB- 11 Const LJ 375 which in the present case the Court of Appeal treated as binding on it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	240	In Knott v Bolton an architect was asked to design a wide staircase for a gallery and impressive entrance hall . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	241	He failed to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	242	The plaintiff spent money in improving the staircase to some extent and he recovered the cost of the changes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	243	The plaintiff also claimed damages for disappointment and distress in the lack of an impressive staircase . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	244	In agreement with the trial judge the Court of Appeal disallowed this part of his claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	245	Reliance was placed on the dicta of Bingham LJ in Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 , 1445 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	246	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	247	Interpreting the dicta of Bingham LJ in Watts v Morrow narrowly the Court of Appeal in Knott v Bolton ruled that the central object of the contract was to design a house , not to provide pleasure to the occupiers of the house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	248	It is important , however , to note that Knott v Bolton was decided a few months before the decision of the House in Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 344 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	249	In any event , the technicality of the reasoning in Knott v Bolton , and therefore in the Court of Appeal judgments in the present case , is apparent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	250	It is obvious , and conceded , that if an architect is employed only to design a staircase , or a surveyor is employed only to investigate aircraft noise , the breach of such a distinct obligation may result in an award of non-pecuniary damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	251	Logically the same must be the case if the architect or surveyor , apart from entering into a general retainer , concludes a separate contract , separately remunerated , in respect of the design of a staircase or the investigation of aircraft noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	252	If this is so the distinction drawn in Knott v Bolton and in the present case is a matter of form and not substance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	253	David Capper , `` Damages for Distress and Disappointment - The Limits of Watts v Morrow '' -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 116 LQR 553 , 556 -RRB- has persuasively argued : `` A ruling that intangible interests only qualify for legal protection where they are the `` very object of the contract '' is tantamount to a ruling that contracts where these interests are merely important , but not the central object of the contract , are in part unenforceable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	254	It is very difficult to see what policy objection there can be to parties to a contract agreeing that these interests are to be protected via contracts where the central object is something else . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	255	If the defendant is unwilling to accept this responsibility he or she can say so and either no contract will be made or one will be made but including a disclaimer . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	256	There is no reason in principle or policy why the scope of recovery in the exceptional category should depend on the object of the contract as ascertained from all its constituent parts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	257	It is sufficient if a major or important object of the contract is to give pleasure , relaxation or peace of mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	258	In my view Knott v Bolton 11 Const LJ 375 was wrongly decided and should be overruled . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	259	To the extent that the majority in the Court of Appeal relied on Knott v Bolton their decision was wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	260	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	261	That brings me to the second issue , namely whether the plaintiff 's claim is barred by reason of the fact that the surveyor undertook an obligation to exercise reasonable care and did not guarantee the achievement of a result . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	262	This was the basis upon which Hale LJ after the first hearing in the Court of Appeal thought that the claim should be disallowed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	263	This reasoning was adopted by the second Court of Appeal and formed an essential part of the reasoning of the majority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	264	This was the basis on which they distinguished Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 344 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	265	Against the broad sweep of differently framed contractual undertakings , and the central purpose of contract law in promoting the observance of contractual promises , I am satisfied that this distinction ought not to prevail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	266	It is certainly not rooted in precedent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	267	I would not accept the suggestion that it has the pedigree of an observation of Ralph Gibson LJ in Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 , 1442B-D : his emphasis appears to have been on the fact that the contract did not serve to provide peace of mind , and so forth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	268	As far as I am aware the distinction was first articulated in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	269	In any event , I would reject it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	270	I fully accept , of course , that contractual guarantees of performance and promises to exercise reasonable care are fundamentally different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	271	The former may sometimes give greater protection than the latter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	272	Proving breach of an obligation of reasonable care may be more difficult than proving breach of a guarantee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	273	On the other hand , a party may in practice be willing to settle for the relative reassurance offered by the obligation of reasonable care undertaken by a professional man . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	274	But why should this difference between an absolute and relative contractual promise require a distinction in respect of the recovery of non-pecuniary damages ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	275	Take the example of a travel agent who is consulted by a couple who are looking for a golfing holiday in France . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	276	Why should it make a difference in respect of the recoverability of non-pecuniary damages for a spoiled holiday whether the travel agent gives a guarantee that there is a golf course very near the hotel , represents that to be the case , or negligently advises that all hotels of the particular chain of hotels are situated next to golf courses ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	277	If the nearest golf course is in fact 50 miles away a breach may be established . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	278	It may spoil the holiday of the couple . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	279	It is difficult to see why in principle only those plaintiffs who negotiate guarantees may recover non-pecuniary damages for a breach of contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	280	It is a singlarly unattractive result that a professional man , who undertakes a specific obligation to exercise reasonable care to investigate a matter judged and communicated to be important by his customer can in Lord Mustill 's words in Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 344 , 360 `` please himself whether or not to comply with the wishes of the promisee which , as embodied in the contract , formed part of the consideration for the price '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	281	If that were the law it would be seriously deficient . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
106	282	I am satisfied that it is not the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	283	In my view the distinction drawn by Hale LJ and by the majority in the Court of Appeal between contractual guarantees and obligations of reasonable care is unsound . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	284	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	285	The final argument was that by failing to move out the plaintiff forfeited a right to claim non-pecuniary damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	286	This argument was not advanced in the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	287	It will be recalled that the judge found as a fact that the plaintiff had acted reasonably in making `` the best of a bad job '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	288	The plaintiff 's decision also avoided a larger claim against the surveyor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	289	It was never explained on what legal principle the plaintiff 's decision not to move out divested him of a claim for non-pecuniary damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	290	Reference was made to a passage in the judgment of Bingham LJ in Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 , 1445C . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	291	Examination showed , however , that the observation , speculative as it was , did not relate to the claim for non-pecuniary damages : see the criticism of Professor M P Furmston , `` Damages - Diminution in Value or Cost of Repair ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	292	- Damages for Distress '' -LRB- 1993 -RRB- 6 JCL 64 , 65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	293	The third argument must also be rejected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	294	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	295	While the dicta of Bingham LJ are of continuing usefulness as a starting point , it will be necessary to read them subject to the three points on which I have rejected the submissions made on behalf of the surveyor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	296	VIII . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	297	Quantum 28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	298	In the surveyor 's written case it was submitted that the award of # 10,000 was excessive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	299	It was certainly high . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	300	Given that the plaintiff is stuck indefinitely with a position which he sought to avoid by the terms of his contract with the surveyor I am not prepared to interfere with the judge 's evaluation on the special facts of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	301	On the other hand , I have to say that the size of the award appears to be at the very top end of what could possibly be regarded as appropriate damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	302	Like Bingham LJ in Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 , 1445H I consider that awards in this area should be restrained and modest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	303	It is important that logical and beneficial developments in this corner of the law should not contribute to the creation of a society bent on litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

106	305	Conclusion 29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	306	In agreement with the reasoning of Clarke LJ I would therefore hold that the decision of the majority in the Court of Appeal was wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	307	I would also reject the subsidiary written argument of counsel for the surveyor that the plaintiff was not entitled to his costs at trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	308	X. Inconvenience and discomfort 30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	309	It is strictly unnecessary to discuss the question whether the judge 's decision can be justified on the ground that the breach of contract resulted in inconvenience and discomfort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	310	It is , however , appropriate that I indicate my view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	311	The judge had a great deal of evidence on aircraft noise at Riverside House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	312	It is conceded that noise can produce a physical reaction and can , depending on its intensity and the circumstances , constitute a nuisance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	313	Noise from aircraft is exempted from the statutory nuisance system and in general no action lies in common law nuisance by reason only of the flight of aircraft over a property : see section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 and McCracken , Jones , Pereira and Payne , Statutory Nuisance , 2001 , 10.33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	314	The existence of the legislation shows that aircraft noise could arguably constitute a nuisance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	315	In any event , aircraft noise is capable of causing inconvenience and discomfort within the meaning of Bingham LJ 's relevant proposition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	316	It is a matter of degree whether the case passes the threshold . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	317	It is sufficient to say that I have not been persuaded that the judge 's decision on this point was not open to him on the evidence which he accepted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	318	For this further reason , in general agreement with Clarke LJ , I would rule that the decision of the Court of Appeal was wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

106	329	LORD CLYDE 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	330	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	331	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	332	In December 1990 the appellant plaintiff , Graham Farley , was interested in buying a house at Blackboys , East Sussex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	333	The trial judge described it as a beautiful house in a beautiful setting . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	334	It had a terrace , a croquet lawn , a tennis court , an orchard , a paddock and a swimming pool . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	335	The property is not very far from Gatwick Airport . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	336	He engaged the respondent defendant , a surveyor , to inspect and report on the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	337	He also asked him to report on certain specific matters , including whether the property would be affected by aircraft noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	338	The defendant did so , but it is now accepted that his report was negligent in relation to the aircraft noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	339	The plaintiff relied on the report and bought the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	340	Considerable work required to be done to the house and some time passed before the plaintiff was able to move in . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	341	He then discovered the extent of the aircraft noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	342	Had the defendant made an adequate investigation of the aircraft noise he would have ascertained the true position and the plaintiff would not have bought the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	343	His enjoyment of the amenity of the property outside the house has been diminished by aircraft noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	344	He has not sought to sell the property and does not intend to do so He claims damages for the impairment to his use and enjoyment of the property caused by aircraft noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	345	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	346	Much weight in the argument was placed upon the observations of Bingham LJ in Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 , 1445 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	347	Having expressed the general rule that a contract-breaker is not in general liable for the distress and suchlike which may follow upon the breach , his Lordship continued : `` But the rule is not absolute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	348	Where the very object of a contract is to provide pleasure , relaxation , peace of mind or freedom from molestation , damages will be awarded if the fruit of the contract is not provided or if the contrary result is procured instead . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	349	If the law did not cater for this exceptional category of case it would be defective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	350	A contract to survey the condition of a house for a prospective purchaser does not , however , fall into this exceptional category . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	351	In cases not falling within this exceptional category , damages are in my view recoverable for physical inconvenience and discomfort caused by the breach and mental suffering directly related to that inconvenience and discomfort . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	352	In the ordinary case accordingly damages may be awarded for inconvenience , but not for mere distress ; but where the contract is aimed at procuring peace or pleasure , then , if as a result of the breach of contract that expected pleasure is not realised , the party suffering that loss may be entitled to an award of damages for the distress . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	353	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	354	It would detract from the importance of this summary in Watts v Morrow if the words used were to be treated as written in stone and subjected to the kind of analysis which might be more appropriate to a conveyancing document . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	355	The expression `` physical inconvenience '' may be traced at least to the judgment of Hobbs v London and South Western Railway Co -LRB- 1875 -RRB- LR 10 QB 111 , 122 , where in that case damages were awarded for the inconvenience suffered by the plaintiffs for having to walk between four and five miles home as a result of the train on which they had taken tickets to Wimbledon travelling instead to Esher . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	356	They had tried to obtain a conveyance but found that there was none to be had . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	357	A further claim was made for the consequences of an illness which the wife contracted as a result of the walk but that was refused by the Court of Appeal as too remote . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	358	The railway company paid into court # 2 as being ample to cover the cost of a conveyance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	359	They resisted a larger award for inconvenience , relying on the observations of Pollock CJ in Hamlin v Great Northern Railway Co -LRB- 1856 -RRB- 1 H & N 408 , 411 to the effect a plaintiff could recover whatever damages naturally resulted from the breach of contract , `` but not damages for the disappointment of mind occasioned by the breach of contract '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	360	Cockburn CJ referred , at p 115 , to the claim which was allowed as one for `` personal inconvenience '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	361	Blackburn J referred to it , at p 120 , as an `` inconvenience '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	362	Mellor J , at p 122 , contrasted matters of `` real physical inconvenience '' with matters `` purely sentimental '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
106	363	Archibald J observed , at p 124 : `` The case is not one of mere vexation , but it is one of physical inconvenience , which can in a sense be measured by money value ... . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	364	It does not seem to me that there is any particular magic in the word `` physical '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	365	It served in Hobbs 's case to emphasise the exclusion of matters purely sentimental , but it should not require detailed analysis or definition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	366	As matter of terminology I should have thought that `` inconvenience '' by itself sufficiently covered the kinds of difficulty and discomfort which are more than mere matters of sentimentality , and that `` disappointment '' would serve as a sufficient label for those mental reactions which in general the policy of the law will exclude . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	367	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	368	In Hobbs 's case the defendants were prepared to compensate the plaintiffs for the cost of a conveyance , even although they had not been able to find any . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	369	In the present case the defendant would be prepared to pay for the costs of sale and removal if the plaintiff had decided to sell because of the noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	370	It is said by the respondent that since he has decided to keep the house he is not entitled to any damages at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	371	But in Hobbs the plaintiffs were entitled to damages in respect of the inconvenience . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	372	It is hard to understand why a corresponding result should not follow here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	373	That an award may be made in such circumstances is to my mind in line with the thinking of this House in Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 344 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	374	In that case there was a breach in the performance of a contract to provide a pleasurable amenity , a swimming pool . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	375	The cost of rebuilding it to conform to the required specification was an unreasonable and inappropriate measure of the damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	376	The House restored the judge 's original award of general damages for loss of amenity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	377	So also here , where the plaintiff has decided to remain in the property despite its disadvantage , he should not be altogether deprived by the law of any compensation for the breach of contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	378	It may be noticed in passing that in Hobbs 's case the damages awarded for the inconvenience were substantially more than the cost of the conveyance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	379	In the present case it seems that the cost of removal , for which at an earlier stage the plaintiff was claiming , far exceeded the sum awarded for inconvenience . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	380	But those differences do not affect the principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	381	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	382	The judge found that the plaintiff was not a man of excessive susceptibility and he refers to the inconvenience he was suffering as `` real discomfort '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	383	I do not consider it appropriate to explore the detail of the inconvenience as being `` physical '' , either because it impacts upon his eardrums , or because it has some geographical element , such as the relative locations of the aircraft and the property , or the obviously greater audibility of their movements when the plaintiff is seeking to enjoy the amenity of the terrace and the gardens than when he is inside the house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	384	In my view the real discomfort which the judge found to exist constituted an inconvenience to the plaintiff which is not a mere matter of disappointment or sentiment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	385	It is unnecessary that the noise should be so great as to make it impossible for the plaintiff to sit at all on his terrace . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	386	Plainly it significantly interferes with his enjoyment of the property and in my view that inconvenience is something for which damages can and should be awarded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	387	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	388	As I have already noted the plaintiff 's claim has been not for disappointment at the absence of the expected pleasure but for inconvenience . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	389	The claim related to the use and enjoyment of the property , but I do not understand this as intended to include injury to his personal feelings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	390	The judge quoted from the headnote to Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 , 1422 , where the summary is given in these terms : '' -LRB- 2 -RRB- That in the case of the ordinary surveyor 's contract general damages were recoverable only for distress and inconvenience caused by physical consequences of the breach of contract ... '' That formulation is no doubt prompted by such passages in the judgment of Ralph Gibson LJ , at p 1442C -LRB- `` distress caused by physical consequences '' -RRB- and 1443D -LRB- `` the physical consequence of such a breach '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	391	But elsewhere he uses the expression `` physical discomfort or inconvenience resulting from the breach ... '' -LRB- eg at p 1440B-C -RRB- and the language of Bingham LJ , at p 1445 , which I have already quoted is in like terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	392	But it seems plain that the judge was proceeding upon the basis that this was an ordinary surveyor 's contract and the award which he sought to make was intended to be within the guidance which Watts v Morrow gave him on that approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	393	That is to say that it was not an award falling within the exceptional category noted in Watts v Morrow . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	394	He recorded that the plaintiff found the noise to be a `` confounded nuisance '' , but the award which he made was intended to meet the `` real discomfort '' which he found the plaintiff to be suffering . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	395	It seems to me that he decided the case as an ordinary example of inconvenience following on a breach of contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	396	In my view he was entitled to make an award on that basis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	397	While the judge thought that the award would be regarded by the plaintiff as almost derisory I would regard it as almost erring on the side of generosity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	398	But I would not interfere with it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	399	In my view the appeal can be allowed on the foregoing basis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	400	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	401	But it is possible to approach the case as one of the exceptional kind in which the claim would be for damages for disappointment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	402	If that approach was adopted so as to seek damages for disappointment , I consider that it should also succeed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	403	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	404	It should be observed at the outset that damages should not be awarded , unless perhaps nominally , for the fact of a breach of contract as distinct from the consequences of the breach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	405	That was a point which I sought to stress in Panatown Ltd v Alfred McAlpine Construction Ltd -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 4 All ER 97 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	406	For an award to be made a loss or injury has to be identified which is a consequence of the breach but not too remote from it , and which somehow or other can be expressed and quantified in terms of a sum of money . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	407	So disappointment merely at the fact that the contract has been breached is not a proper ground for an award . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	408	The mere fact of the loss of a bargain should not be the subject of compensation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	409	But that is not the kind of claim which the plaintiff is making here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	410	What he is seeking is damages for the inconvenience of the noise , the invasion of the peace and quiet which he expected the property to possess and the diminution in his use and enjoyment of the property on account of the aircraft noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	411	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	412	The critical factor on this approach , as it seems to me , is that the plaintiff made the specific request of the defendant to discover whether the property might be affected by aircraft noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	413	It is suggested that because this point was wrapped up together with a number of other matters in the instructions given by the plaintiff it can not be regarded as constituting the `` very object '' of the contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	414	But that approach seems to me simply to be playing with words . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	415	What is referred to as a breach of contract is often a breach of a particular provision in a contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	416	The effect of that breach may affect the continued existence of the other terms of the contract , so as to bring the whole to an end . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	417	But the point which is the focus of concern is a particular provision in the whole agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	418	I can see no reason for distinguishing the present case from a situation where the plaintiff had instructed the defendant simply to advise on the matter of aircraft noise , having already obtained a survey report covering all the other matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	419	The defendant 's argument gained some support from Knott v Bolton -LRB- 1995 -RRB- 11 Const LJ 375 where the Court of Appeal regarded the failure to provide the wide staircase and gallery which the clients had particularly requested as the main object of the contract with the architects was held to be the designing of the house , not the giving of pleasure in respect of the staircase and the gallery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	420	In so far as the court proceeded on the basis that the contract could only be regarded as a whole I consider that it was mistaken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	421	The approach involves a very literal reading of the passage in Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 , to which I have already referred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	422	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	423	What was said in Watts v Morrow must be seen in the context of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	424	It is instructive to refer to a passage in the judgment of Ralph Gibson LJ with which Bingham LJ was expressly in complete agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	425	He said , at p 1442 , of the proposition that the contract in that case was a contract whose subject matter was to provide peace of mind or freedom from distress : `` That , with respect , seems to me to be an impossible view of the ordinary surveyor 's contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	426	No doubt house buyers hope to enjoy peace of mind and freedom from distress as a consequence of the proper performance by a surveyor of his contractual obligation to provide a careful report , but there was no express promise for the provision of peace of mind or freedom from distress and no such implied promise was alleged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	427	In my view , in the case of the ordinary surveyor 's contract , damages are only recoverable for distress caused by physical consequences of the breach of contract . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	428	The present case is not an `` ordinary surveyor 's contract '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	429	The request for the report on aircraft noise was additional to the usual matters expected of a surveyor in the survey of a property and could properly have attracted a extra fee if he had spent extra time researching that issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	430	It is the specific provision relating to the peacefulness of the property in respect of aircraft noise which makes the present case out of the ordinary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	431	The criterion is not some general characteristic of the contract , as , for example , that it is or is not a `` commercial '' contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	432	The critical factor is the object of the particular agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	433	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	434	The defendant , following something of the thinking in the second hearing before the Court of Appeal in the present case , sought to take from the passage in the judgment of Ralph Gibson LJ in Watts v Morrow , at p 1442 , support for an argument that while damages for distress might be granted in the case of a breach of a warranty for the provision of peace and quiet , an award should not be permitted where the case is one of a failure to exercise reasonable skill and care in the performance of a contractual obligation to provide information . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	435	I am not persuaded that that can fairly be taken from the passage in question nor that the alleged consequence follows from the distinction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	436	There would be no sufficient logic in allowing damages for inconvenience where the travel agent warrants that the client will have peace and quiet on the beach at Brighton and refusing damages where he negligently advises his client that that beach would be a place to find peace and quiet . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	437	Nor does it seem to me that the distinction is one supported by precedent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	438	On the contrary Heywood v Wellers -LSB- 1976 -RSB- QB 446 was a case of negligent advice by a solicitor where an award for the consequent distress was made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	439	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	440	The object of the request to consider the risk of aircraft noise was very plainly to enable the plaintiff to determine the extent of the peace and quiet which he could enjoy at the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	441	It would be within the contemplation of the defendant that if the noise was such as to interfere with the occupier 's peaceful enjoyment of the property the plaintiff would either not buy it at all or live there deprived of his expectation of peace and quiet . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	442	Each of these consequences seems to me to flow directly from the breach of contract so as to enable an award of damages to be made on one or other basis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
106	443	The present case can in my view qualify as one of the exceptional cases where a contract for peace or pleasure has been made and breached , thereby entitling the injured party to claim damages for the disappointment occasioned by the breach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	444	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	445	For the foregoing reasons I would allow the appeal and restore the judge 's award . 	lord clyde	self	outcome	0.6	NAN

106	450	I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn and I gratefully adopt his account of the facts of the case and of the issues to which they give rise and I can therefore proceed to state my opinion on those issues . 	lord hutton	lord steyn	factagr	0.6	NAN
106	451	I consider first the question whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages to compensate him for the annoyance and nuisance from aircraft noise to which the defendant 's breach of contract exposed him , the judge having found that the plaintiff would not have bought the house if the defendant , as he should have done under the contract , had advised him of the true position in relation to aircraft noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	452	I propose to consider this issue on the assumption -LRB- contrary to the opinion which I express later -RRB- that the annoyance and nuisance from aircraft noise did not constitute physical inconvenience and discomfort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	453	The principle , and the exception to it , stated in Watts v Morrow 47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	454	It is clearly established as a general rule that where there has been a breach of contract damages can not be awarded for the vexation or anxiety or aggravation or similar states of mind resulting from the breach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	455	The principle was stated by Bingham LJ in Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 , 1445 : `` A contract-breaker is not in general liable for any distress , frustration , anxiety , displeasure , vexation , tension or aggravation which his breach of contract may cause to the innocent party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	456	This rule is not , I think , founded on the assumption that such reactions are not foreseeable , which they surely are or may be , but on considerations of policy '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	457	This general principle has recently been approved by this House in Johnson v Gore Wood & Co -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 2 WLR 72 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	458	The principle has particular application to commercial cases and in Johnson v Gore Wood & Co Lord Cooke of Thorndon observed , at p 108 , that : `` Contract-breaking is treated as an incident of commercial life which players in the game are expected to meet with mental fortitude . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	459	But the principle is not applicable in every case and in Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 Bingham LJ went on to state , at p 1445 , that there was an exceptional category of cases which he described as follows : `` Where the very object of a contract is to provide pleasure , relaxation , peace of mind or freedom from molestation , damages will be awarded if the fruit of the contract is not provided or if the contrary result is procured instead . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	460	If the law did not cater for this exceptional category of case it would be defective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN

106	462	Bingham LJ . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	463	then stated : `` In cases not falling within this exceptional category , damages are in my view recoverable for physical inconvenience and discomfort caused by the breach and mental suffering directly related to that inconvenience and discomfort '' Cases such as Jarvis v Swans Tours Ltd -LSB- 1973 -RSB- QB 233 where a travel company in breach of contract fails to provide the holiday for which the plaintiff has paid and damages are awarded for mental distress , inconvenience , upset , disappointment and frustration are examples of this exception to the general principle .

106	471	This House held that reinstatement would be unreasonable and the expense of the work involved would be out of all proportion to the benefit to be obtained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	472	But the speeches of Lord Mustill and Lord Lloyd of Berwick are important in relation to the present case because they considered the entitlement of a party to a building contract to recover damages for breach of contract where he was not entitled to the cost of reinstatement and where the breach had not caused diminution in the market value of the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	473	Their conclusion was that in such a case justice required that reasonable damages should be awarded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	474	Lord Mustill stated , at p 360 : `` It is a common feature of small building works performed on residential property that the cost of the work is not fully reflected by an increase in the market value of the house , and that comparatively minor deviations from specification or sound workmanship may have no direct financial effect at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	475	Yet the householder must surely be entitled to say that he chose to obtain from the builder a promise to produce a particular result because he wanted to make his house more comfortable , more convenient and more conformable to his own particular tastes ; not because he had in mind that the work might increase the amount which he would receive if , contrary to expectation , he thought it expedient in the future to exchange his home for cash . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	476	To say that in order to escape unscathed the builder has only to show that to the mind of the average onlooker , or the average potential buyer , the results which he has produced seem just as good as those which he had promised would make a part of the promise illusory , and unbalance the bargain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	477	In the valuable analysis contained in Radford v. De Froberville -LSB- 1977 -RSB- 1 WLR 1262 , Oliver J. emphasised , at p. 1270 , that it was for the plaintiff to judge what performance he required in exchange for the price . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	478	The court should honour that choice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	479	Pacta sunt servanda . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	480	If the plaintiff 's argument leads to the conclusion that in all cases like the present the employer is entitled to no more than nominal damages , the average householder would say that there must be something wrong with the law '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	481	And he stated , at pp 360-361 , that in some cases : `` and in particular those where the contract is designed to fulfil a purely commercial purpose , the loss will very often consist only of the monetary detriment brought about by the breach of contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	482	But these remedies are not exhaustive , for the law must cater for those occasions where the value of the promise to the promisee exceeds the financial enhancement of his position which full performance will secure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	483	This excess , often referred to in the literature as the `` consumer surplus '' -LRB- see for example the valuable discussion by Harris , Ogus and Phillips , `` Contract Remedies and the Consumer Surplus '' -LRB- 1979 -RRB- 95 LQR 581 -RRB- is usually incapable of precise valuation in terms of money , exactly because it represents a personal , subjective and non-monetary gain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	484	Nevertheless where it exists the law should recognise it and compensate the promisee if the misperformance takes it away . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	485	49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	486	In his speech Lord Lloyd referred , at p 374 , to the general rule that in claims for breach of contract the plaintiff can not recover damages for his injured feelings and referred to the exception to this rule , as exemplified in the holiday cases , that a plaintiff may recover damages for his disappointment where the object of a contract is to afford pleasure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	487	He stated that this was the principle which the trial judge had applied and he held that the judge had been entitled to award # 2,500 to the householder on the ground that the contract was one `` for the provision of a pleasurable amenity '' , and in the event the householder 's pleasure was not as great as it would have been if the pool had been 7 feet 6 inches deep . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	488	He then stated : `` That leaves one last question for consideration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	489	I have expressed agreement with the judge 's approach to damages based on loss of amenity on the facts of the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	490	But in most cases such an approach would not be available . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	491	What is then to be the position where , in the case of a new house , the building does not conform in some minor respect to the contract , as , for example , where there is a difference in level between two rooms , necessitating a step . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	492	Suppose there is no measurable difference in value of the complete house , and the cost of reinstatement would be prohibitive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	493	Is there any reason why the court should not award by way of damages for breach of contract some modest sum , not based on difference in value , but solely to compensate the buyer for his disappointed expectations ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	494	Is the law of damages so inflexible , as I asked earlier , that it can not find some middle ground in such a case ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	495	I do not give a final answer to that question in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	496	But it may be that it would have afforded an alternative ground for justifying the judge 's award of damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	497	And if the judge had wanted a precedent , he could have found it in Sir David Cairns 's judgment in G W Atkins Ltd v Scott -LRB- 1991 -RRB- 7 Const LJ 215 , where , it will be remembered , the Court of Appeal upheld the judge 's award of # 250 for defective tiling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	498	Sir David Cairns said , at p 221 : ` There are many circumstances where a judge has nothing but his common sense to guide him in fixing the quantum of damages , for instance , for pain and suffering , for loss of pleasurable activities or for inconvenience of one kind or another ' '' .

106	500	Whilst Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 344 was concerned with the proper measure of damages for breach of a construction contract , I consider that the principle stated in it can be of more general application and that , as Lord Mustill stated , at p 360 , there are some occasions `` where the value of the promise to the promisee exceeds the financial enhancement of his position which full performance will secure '' and for which the law must provide a remedy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	501	In my opinion the present case falls within the ambit of this principle as the defendant in breach of contract failed to alert the plaintiff to the presence of aircraft noise with the result that the plaintiff bought a house which he would not have bought if he had been made aware of the true position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	502	51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	503	Counsel for the defendant submitted that even if it were right to extend the exception as exemplified by the holiday cases to other cases , nevertheless the exception must be confined to cases where , in the words of Bingham LJ in Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 , 1445 , `` the very object of a contract '' is to provide the benefit which the promisee regards as being of particular importance to him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	504	This argument was accepted by Hale LJ in the first hearing before the Court of Appeal and by Stuart Smith and Mummery LLJ in the second hearing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	505	I am unable to accept this submission because I can see no reason in principle why , if a plaintiff who has suffered no financial loss can recover damages in some cases if there has been a breach of the principal obligation of the contract , he should be denied damages for breach of an obligation which , whilst not the principal obligation of the contract , is nevertheless one which he has made clear to the other party is of importance to him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	506	It is clear from the speech of Lord Mustill in Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 344 , 360 that he considered that a householder may obtain damages for comparatively minor deviations from specification or sound workmanship which do not cause any diminution in the value of the house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	507	And it is clear that in that case the obligation to build a pool 7 feet 6 inches deep as opposed to 6 feet deep could not be regarded as the principal obligation or the very object of the contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN

106	509	In Knott v Bolton -LRB- 1995 -RRB- 11 Const LJ 375 the defendant architect was given instructions to include in his design of a house a wide staircase with a gallery area and an imposing and impressive entrance hall and he failed to carry out these instructions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	510	The plaintiff sought to recover general damages for the disappointment and distress they suffered by reason of this failure , but their claim was rejected by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	511	In a judgment delivered some months before the decision of the House in Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth , Russell LJ laid emphasis , at p 376 , on the words `` the very object of -LSB- the -RSB- contract '' in Bingham LJ 's judgment in Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 , 1445 and stated : `` One or two comments upon that passage are apposite . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	512	In my judgment the words ` the very object of a contract ' are crucial within the context of the instant case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	513	The very object of the contract entered into by Mr Terence Bolton was to design for the Knotts their house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	514	As an ancillary of that of course it was in the contemplation of Mr Bolton and of the Knotts that pleasure would be provided , but the provision of pleasure to the occupiers of the house was not the very object of the contract and there was nothing in the contractual relationship between Mr Bolton and the Knotts to indicate that he in any sense warranted or expressed himself to be contractually bound to provide for the Knotts the pleasure of occupation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	515	Of course the pleasure of their occupation was an ancillary of the object of the contract , but it was not the very object of the contract '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	516	I consider , with respect , that in that case the Court of Appeal was led into error by concentrating too much on the concept of the provision of pleasure - the correct approach would have been to have taken the view later expressed by Lord Mustill in his speech in Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 344 , 360B and to have held that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover some reasonable damages because they were entitled to say that they chose to obtain from the architect a promise to produce a particular design in order to make the house conform to their own particular tastes and wishes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	517	Accordingly I consider that the decision of the Court of Appeal in Knott v Bolton 11 Const LJ 375 should not be followed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	518	53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	519	I further consider that there is no valid distinction between a case where a party promises to achieve a result and a case where a party is under a contractual obligation to take reasonable care to achieve a result . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	520	Suppose a case where a householder 's enjoyment of his garden is spoilt by an unpleasant smell from a septic tank at the bottom of the garden and he employs a company to clean out the tank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	521	If the contract constituted a promise by the company to clean out the tank and it failed to do so , with the result that the smell continued , I think that in accordance with the principle stated by Lord Mustill in Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 344 , 360-361 the householder would be entitled to recover a modest sum of damages for the annoyance caused by the continuation of the smell . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	522	But if the contract provided that the company would exercise reasonable care and skill to clean out the tank and due to its negligence the tank was not cleaned out , I consider that the householder would also be entitled to damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	523	54 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
106	524	Whilst I do not accept the submission advanced on behalf of the defendant that , where there is no pecuniary loss , damages can only be recovered where the claim is for breach of an obligation which is the very object of the contract , I think that -LRB- other than in building contract cases where the principle stated by Lord Mustill in Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth , at p 360 , gives direct guidance -RRB- there is a need for a test which the courts can apply in practice in order to preserve the fundamental principle that general damages are not recoverable for anxiety and aggravation and similar states of mind caused by a breach of contract and to prevent the exception expanding to swallow up , or to diminish unjustifiably , the principle itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	525	It will be for the courts , in the differing circumstances of individual cases , to apply the principles stated in your Lordships ' speeches in this case , and the matter is not one where any precise test or verbal formula can be applied but , adopting the helpful submissions of counsel for the plaintiff , I consider that as a general approach it would be appropriate to treat as cases falling within the exception and calling for an award of damages those where : 1 . 	lord hutton	all	partagr	0.7	NAN
106	526	the matter in respect of which the individual claimant seeks damages is of importance to him , and 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	527	the individual claimant has made clear to the other party that the matter is of importance to him , and 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	528	the action to be taken in relation to the matter is made a specific term of the contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	529	If these three conditions are satisfied , as they are in the present case , then I consider that the claim for damages should not be rejected on the ground that the fulfilment of that obligation is not the principal object of the contract or on the ground that the other party does not receive special and specific remuneration in respect of the performance of that obligation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	530	55 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	531	Counsel for the defendant submitted that the award of damages of # 10,000 was manifestly excessive as it constituted compensation for the inconvenience and annoyance from the aircraft noise which the plaintiff would continue to suffer for an indefinite period in the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	532	In support of this submission counsel relied on the observation of Bingham LJ in Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 , 1445 : `` If , on learning of the defects which should have been but were not reported , a purchaser decides , for whatever reason , to retain the house and not move out and sell , I would question whether any loss he thereafter suffers , at least in the ordinary case , can be laid at the door of the contract-breaker '' Therefore counsel submitted that the damages should have been restricted to compensation for inconvenience and annoyance suffered for one year , that being a reasonable time during which the plaintiff could have moved house ; after the period of a year , the inconvenience and annoyance suffered by the plaintiff could not be regarded as caused by default of the defendant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	533	56 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	534	I am unable to accept that submission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	535	I consider that in the circumstance of this case where the plaintiff had expended a considerable sum of money in improving the house before he was aware of the defendant 's failure to inform him of aircraft noise , and where he would have had to incur very considerable expense in selling and buying a new house and moving to it , it was reasonable for him to decide to stay in the house , even though that involved putting up with the noise , and I think that the trial judge was right to reject the defendant 's argument on this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	536	Physical inconvenience and discomfort 57 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	537	The second principal issue which arises on this appeal is whether , as a separate ground , the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages because the aircraft noise constituted physical inconvenience and discomfort which he suffered as a consequence of the defendant 's breach of contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	538	The authorities cited and analysed by Clarke LJ in his judgment make it clear , as he observes -LSB- 2000 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep 516 , 527 , that damages are recoverable for physical inconvenience and that it is not necessary to establish any kind of physical injury or loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	539	Thus in Hobbs v London and South Western Railway Co -LRB- 1875 -RRB- LR 10 QB 111 , Cockburn CJ stated , at p 117 : `` I think there is no authority that personal inconvenience , where it is sufficiently serious , should not be the subject of damages to be recovered in an action of this kind '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	540	Mellor J stated , at pp 122-123 : `` I quite agree with my brother Parry , that for the mere inconvenience , such as annoyance and loss of temper , or vexation , or for being disappointed in a particular thing which you have set your mind upon , without real physical inconvenience resulting , you can not recover damages ... where the inconvenience is real and substantial arising from being obliged to walk home , I can not see why that should not be capable of being assessed as damages in respect of inconvenience '' And Archibald J stated , at p 124 : `` The case is not one of mere vexation , but it is one of physical inconvenience , which can in a sense be measured by money value , and the parties here had the firm measure of that inconvenience in the damages given by the jury '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	541	58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	542	I also consider that Barry J. in Bailey v Bullock -LSB- 1950 -RSB- 2 All ER 1167 , 1170-1171 and Beldam LJ in Wapshott v Davis Donovan & Co -LSB- 1996 -RSB- PNLR 361 , 378 were right to emphasise that there is a distinction between mere annoyance or disappointment at the failure of the other party to carry out his contractual obligation and actual physical inconvenience and discomfort caused by the breach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	543	Therefore the judge was entitled to award damages to the plaintiff for the annoyance caused to him by the aircraft noise if the noise constituted physical inconvenience and discomfort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	544	59 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	545	In his careful judgment the judge expressly referred to one head of damages discussed in Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 and cited part of the headnote which states : `` in the case of the ordinary surveyor 's contract general damages were recoverable only for distress and inconvenience caused by physical consequences of the breach of contract ... such damages should be a modest sum for the amount of physical discomfort endured ... '' Therefore the judge clearly had in mind that damages could only be awarded for physical inconvenience and discomfort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	546	He subsequently stated at page 17 of his judgment that the plaintiff had sustained `` real discomfort '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	547	The fact that the judge also stated that the plaintiff found the noise `` a confounded nuisance '' does not , in my opinion , mean that the noise could not be regarded as a physical inconvenience and discomfort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	548	No doubt as Mr Hobbs walked home after midnight with his wife and children the four or five miles from Esher station through the drizzling rain he thought that the walk was a confounded nuisance , but that did not disentitle him from recovering damages for physical inconvenience and discomfort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	549	60 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	550	The aircraft noise was something which affected the plaintiff through his hearing and can be regarded as having a physical effect upon him , and on the evidence which was before him I consider that it was open to the judge to find that the plaintiff suffered physical inconvenience and discomfort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	551	61 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	552	I agree with Judge and Clarke LLJ that on first impression the award of # 10,000 damages appears to be a very high one , but I also agree with them that this is a very unusual case where the inconvenience and discomfort caused to the plaintiff will continue , and on further consideration I do not consider that it would be right for an appellate court to set aside the award as being excessive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	553	Therefore I would allow the appeal and restore the order of the judge . 	lord hutton	self	outcome	0.7	NAN

106	560	The plaintiff , Mr Farley , wanted to purchase a house in the country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN

106	562	It seemed to fit the bill . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	563	It was , however , 15 miles or so from Gatwick Airport . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	564	Mr Farley was anxious that his rural retreat should not be affected by aircraft noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	565	He instructed Mr Skinner , the defendant , who is a chartered surveyor , to inspect the property and report on its general and structural condition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	566	He asked Mr Skinner , also , to report on whether , in view of the proximity of the property to Gatwick Airport , the property would be affected by aircraft noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	567	Mr Skinner accepted these instructions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	568	On 17 December 1990 Mr Skinner provided Mr Farley with a detailed 38-page report . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	569	The report contained , on p 35 , a paragraph about aircraft noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	570	The paragraph indicted Mr Skinner 's opinion that it was `` unlikely that the property will suffer greatly from such noise '' 64 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	571	Unfortunately , Mr Skinner had made inadequate inquiries about aircraft noise and , in particular , had not discovered that within a few miles from the property was the Mayfield Stack , an area where aircraft waiting to land at Gatwick were directed to circle until the airport was ready to receive them and from where their route to the airport frequently passed over or near to Blackboys . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	572	65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	573	It was found by the trial judge , and is accepted before your Lordships , that Mr Skinner 's failure to find out about the Mayfield Stack and to draw its implications to Mr Farley 's attention was an inadequate contractual response to his instructions about aircraft noise . 	lord scott	all	partagr	0.7	NAN

106	578	Mr Farley gave evidence that if he had received from Mr Skinner the information about aircraft noise to which he , Mr Farley , was contractually entitled , he would not have purchased Riverside House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	579	This evidence was accepted by the judge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	580	But , in the event , in reliance on the contractually inadequate information about aircraft noise that he had received from Mr Skinner , Mr Farley purchased the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN

106	582	Having purchased the property , Mr Farley put in hand fairly extensive works of modernisation and renovation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	583	It was only after these had been carried out that he moved in and took up residence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	584	It was then that he discovered that the property was affected by aircraft noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	585	The degree of discomfort caused by noise is always to some extent subjective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	586	There was evidence that many , perhaps most , of the residents in the area were not troubled by the noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN

106	588	69 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	589	He gave evidence that it interfered with his enjoyment of a quiet , reflective breakfast , a morning stroll in his garden or pre-dinner drinks . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	590	The trial judge having heard the evidence , concluded that `` real discomfort has been sustained by Mr Farley in this case '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	591	70 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	592	It is accepted by Mr Simpson , counsel for Mr Skinner , that if Mr Farley , on becoming aware of the extent of the aircraft noise , had decided to re-sell , Mr Skinner would have been liable to compensate him at least for the costs of re-selling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	593	But , having had the house modernised and renovated to his taste , and no doubt having become attached to the house , Mr Farley decided not to sell . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	594	But nonetheless , feeling that he ought to be compensated for Mr Skinner 's breach of contract , he commenced an action for damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	595	71 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	596	He claimed damages on the footing that the true value of the property , affected by the aircraft noise , was substantially less than the price he had paid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN

106	602	The issue on appeal was whether , in law , Mr Farley was entitled to contractual damages for impairment of his enjoyment of Riverside House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
106	603	My noble and learned friend , Lord Steyn , has described the course of proceedings in the Court of Appeal and it suffices for me to say that two Lords Justices held that he was , three held that he was not , and it is now for your Lordships to resolve the issue . 	lord scott	lord steyn	partagr	0.7	NAN
106	604	74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	605	The reason why such an apparently straightforward issue has caused such division of opinion is because it has been represented as raising the question whether and when contractual damages for mental distress are available . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	606	It is highly desirable that your Lordships should resolve the present angst on this subject and avoid the need in the future for relatively simple claims , such as Mr Farley 's , to have to travel to the appellate courts for a ruling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	607	75 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	608	In my opinion , the issue can and should be resolved by applying the well known principles laid down in Hadley v Baxendale -LRB- 1854 -RRB- 9 Exch 341 -LRB- as restated in Victoria Laundry Ltd v Newman Industries Ltd -LSB- 1949 -RSB- 2 KB 528 -RRB- in the light of the recent guidance provided by Bingham LJ in Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 and by this House in Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 344 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	609	76 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	610	The basic principle of damages for breach of contract is that the injured party is entitled , so far as money can do it , to be put in the position he would have been in if the contractual obligation had been properly performed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	611	He is entitled , that is to say , to the benefit of his bargain : see Robinson v Harman -LRB- 1848 -RRB- 1 Exch 850 , 855 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	612	77 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	613	In Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 344 builders had agreed to construct a swimming pool with a diving area 7 feet 6 inches deep . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	614	The pool when constructed had a depth of only 6 feet . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	615	The cost of rebuilding the pool to the contractual depth would have been # 21,560 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	616	But the trial judge , having heard the evidence , concluded that the pool owner did not have the intention of using the damages to reconstruct the pool . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	617	He found also that the residential property of which the pool formed part had suffered no diminution in value by reason of the lack of one foot of depth in the pool 's diving area . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	618	Nonetheless the pool owner claimed the # 21,500 as damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	619	The builders , on the other hand , contended that , on the facts as found , the pool owner had suffered no loss and the damages should be nil . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	620	The trial judge accepted neither contention but instead awarded the # 2,500 expressed as compensation for `` a loss of amenity brought about by the shortfall in depth '' -LRB- see at p 363 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	621	The Court of Appeal -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 WLR 650 set aside the # 2,500 award and substituted an award of the cost of rebuilding , ie the # 21,560 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	622	This House restored the trial judge 's order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	623	78 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	624	Lord Mustill -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 344 , 360 referred to situations where , in the carrying out of building works on residential property , there had been minor deviations from the contractual specifications but where the deviations had not reduced the value of the property below the value it would have had if the work had been properly carried out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	625	He went on : `` Yet the householder must surely be entitled to say that he chose to obtain from the builder a promise to produce a particular result because he wanted to make his house more comfortable , more convenient and more conformable to his own particular tastes ; not because he had in mind that the work might increase the amount which he would receive if , contrary to expectation , he thought it expedient in the future to exchange his home for cash . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	626	To say that in order to escape unscathed the builder has only to show that to the mind of the average onlooker , or the average potential buyer , the results which he has produced seem just as good as those which he had promised would make a part of the promise illusory , and unbalance the bargain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	627	In the valuable analysis contained in Radford v De Froberville -LSB- 1977 -RSB- 1 WLR 1262 , Oliver J emphasised , at p 1270 , that it was for the plaintiff to judge what performance he required in exchange for the price . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	628	The court should honour that choice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	629	Pacta sunt servanda . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	630	If the plaintiff 's argument leads to the conclusion that in all cases like the present the employer is entitled to no more than nominal damages , the average householder would say that there must be something wrong with the law . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	631	Lord Lloyd of Berwick , to the same effect , said , at p 374 : `` What is then to be the position where , in the case of a new house , the building does not conform in some minor respect to the contract , as , for example , where there is a difference in level between two rooms , necessitating a step . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	632	Suppose there is no measurable difference in value of the complete house , and the cost of reinstatement would be prohibitive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	633	Is there any reason why the court should not award by way of damages for breach of contract some modest sum , not based on difference in value , but solely to compensate the buyer for his disappointed expectations ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	634	Is the law of damages so inflexible that it can not find some middle ground in such a case ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	635	I do not give a final answer to that question in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	636	But it may be it would have afforded an alternative ground for justifying the judge 's award of damages . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	637	79 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	638	Ruxley 's case establishes , in my opinion , that if a party 's contractual performance has failed to provide to the other contracting party something to which that other was , under the contract , entitled , and which , if provided , would have been of value to that party , then , if there is no other way of compensating the injured party , the injured party should be compensated in damages to the extent of that value . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	639	Quantification of that value will , in many cases be difficult and may often seem arbitrary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	640	In Ruxley 's case the value placed on the amenity value of which the pool owner had been deprived was # 2,500 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	641	By that award , the pool owner was placed , so far as money could do it , in the position he would have been in if the diving area of the pool had been constructed to the specified depth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	642	80 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	643	In Ruxley 's case the breach of contract by the builders had not caused any consequential loss to the pool owner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	644	He had simply been deprived of the benefit of a pool built to the depth specified in the contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	645	It was not a case where the recovery of damages for consequential loss consisting of vexation , anxiety or other species of mental distress had to be considered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	646	81 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	647	In Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1921 , however , that matter did have to be considered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	648	As in the present case , the litigation in Watts v Morrow resulted from a surveyor 's report . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	649	The report had negligently failed to disclose a number of defects in the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	650	The clients , who had purchased the property in reliance on the report , remedied the defects and sued for damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	651	The judge awarded them the costs of the repairs and also general damages of # 4,000 each for `` distress and inconvenience '' -LRB- p 1424 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	652	As to the cost of repairs , the Court of Appeal substituted an award of damages based on the difference between the value of the property as the surveyor 's report had represented it to be and the value as it actually was . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	653	Nothing , for present purposes , turns on that . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	654	As to the damages for `` distress and inconvenience '' the Court of Appeal upheld the award in principle but held that the damages should be limited to a modest sum for the physical discomfort endured and reduced the award to # 750 for each plaintiff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	655	Bingham LJ , at p 1445 , in an important passage , set out the principles to be applied where contractual damages for distress and inconvenience are claimed : `` A contract-breaker is not in general liable for any distress , frustration , anxiety , displeasure , vexation , tension or aggravation which his breach of contract may cause to the innocent party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	656	This rule is not , I think , founded on the assumption that such reactions are not foreseeable , which they surely are or may be , but on considerations of policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	657	But the rule is not absolute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	658	Where the very object of a contract is to provide pleasure , relaxation , peace of mind or freedom from molestation , damages will be awarded if the fruit of the contract is not provided or if the contrary result is procured instead . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	659	If the law did not cater for this exceptional category of case it would be defective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	660	A contract to survey the condition of a house for a prospective purchaser does not , however , fall within this exceptional category . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	661	In cases not falling within this exceptional category , damages are in my view recoverable for physical inconvenience and discomfort caused by the breach and mental suffering directly related to that inconvenience and discomfort . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	662	82 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	663	In the passage I have cited , Bingham LJ was dealing with claims for consequential damage consisting of the intangible mental states and sensory experiences to which he refers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	664	Save for the matters referred in the first paragraph , all of which reflect or are brought about by the injured party 's disappointment at the contract breaker 's failure to carry out his contractual obligations , and recovery for which , if there is nothing more , is ruled out on policy grounds , Bingham LJ 's approach is , in my view , wholly consistent with established principles for the recovery of contractual damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	665	83 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	666	There are , however , two qualifications that I would respectfully make to the proposition in the final paragraph of the cited passage that damages `` for physical inconvenience and discomfort caused by the breach '' are recoverable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	667	84 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	668	First , there will , in many cases , be an additional remoteness hurdle for the injured party to clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	669	Consequential damage , including damage consisting of inconvenience or discomfort , must , in order to be recoverable , be such as , at the time of the contract , was reasonably foreseeable as liable to result from the breach : see McGregor on Damages , 16th ed -LRB- 1997 -RRB- , para 250 , pp 159-160 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	670	85 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	671	Second , the adjective `` physical '' , in the phrase `` physical inconvenience and discomfort '' , requires , I think , some explanation or definition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	672	The distinction between the `` physical '' and the `` non-physical '' is not always clear and may depend on the context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	673	Is being awoken at night by aircraft noise `` physical '' ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	674	If it is , is being unable to sleep because of worry and anxiety `` physical '' ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	675	What about a reduction in light caused by the erection of a building under a planning permission that an errant surveyor ought to have warned his purchaser-client about but failed to do so ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	676	In my opinion , the critical distinction to be drawn is not a distinction between the different types of inconvenience or discomfort of which complaint may be made but a distinction based on the cause of the inconvenience or discomfort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	677	If the cause is no more than disappointment that the contractual obligation has been broken , damages are not recoverable even if the disappointment has led to a complete mental breakdown . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	678	But , if the cause of the inconvenience or discomfort is a sensory -LRB- sight , touch , hearing , smell etc -RRB- experience , damages can , subject to the remoteness rules , be recovered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	679	86 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	680	In summary , the principle expressed in Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 344 should be used to provide damages for deprivation of a contractual benefit where it is apparent that the injured party has been deprived of something of value but the ordinary means of measuring the recoverable damages are inapplicable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	681	The principle expressed in Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 should be used to determine whether and when contractual damages for inconvenience or discomfort can be recovered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	682	87 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	683	These principles , in my opinion , provide the answer , not only to the issue raised in the present case , but also to the issues raised in the authorities which were cited to your Lordships . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	684	88 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
106	685	In Hobbs v London and South Western Railway Co -LRB- 1875 -RRB- LR 10 QB 111 the claim was for consequential damage caused by the railway company 's breach of contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	686	Instead of taking the plaintiff , his wife and two children to Hampton Court , their train dumped them at Esher and they had to walk five miles or so home in the rain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	687	The plaintiff 's wife caught a cold as a result of the experience . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	688	The plaintiff was awarded damages for the inconvenience and discomfort of his and his family 's walk home but his wife 's cold was held to be too remote a consequence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	689	The plaintiff 's recovery of damages attributable , in part , to the discomfort suffered by his wife and children was in accordance with principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	690	The contractual benefit to which he was entitled was the carriage of himself and his family to Hampton Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	691	It was reasonable in my opinion , to value that benefit , of which he had been deprived by the breach of contract , by reference to the discomfort to the family of the walk home . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	692	This was , in my view , a Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 344 case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	693	89 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	694	Jarvis v Swans Tours Ltd -LSB- 1973 -RSB- QB 233 was a case in which the plaintiff had contracted for a holiday with certain enjoyable qualities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	695	He had been given a holiday which lacked those qualities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	696	His holiday had caused him discomfort and distress . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	697	The trial judge awarded him # 31.72 , one half of the price of the holiday . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	698	This must , I think have been the value attributed by the judge to the contractual benefit of which the plaintiff had been deprived . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	699	But on the plaintiff 's appeal against so low an award , the Court of Appeal allowed him # 125 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	700	90 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	701	Somewhat different reasons were given by the three members of the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	702	Lord Denning MR said , at pp 237-238 : `` In a proper case damages for mental distress can be recovered in contract ... One such case is a contract for a holiday , or any other contract to provide entertainment and enjoyment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	703	If the contracting party breaks his contract , damages can be given for the disappointment , the distress , the upset and frustration caused by the breach . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	704	The reference in this passage to the `` contract for a holiday , or any other contract to provide entertainment and enjoyment '' is consistent with an intention to compensate the plaintiff for the contractual benefit of which he had been deprived . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	705	The reference , however , to `` the disappointment , the distress ... '' etc reads like a reference to consequential damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	706	91 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	707	Edmund Davies LJ based his decision on the defendant 's failure to provide a holiday of the contractual quality '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	708	He held that the amount of damages was not limited by the price for the holiday . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	709	He said , at p 239 : `` The court is entitled , and indeed bound , to contrast the overall quality of the holiday so enticingly promised with that which the defendants in fact provided . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	710	He regarded the plaintiff 's vexation and disappointment as relevant matters to take into account in `` determining what would be proper compensation for the defendants ' marked failure to fulfil their undertaking '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	711	This was a Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 344 approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

106	719	He had booked a holiday for himself , his wife and children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	720	Its quality turned out to be substantially below contractually justified expectations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	721	The plaintiff recovered # 1,100 damages as compensation not only for his own discomfort but also for the discomfort experienced by his wife and children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	722	In my opinion , the justification for such an award is that the plaintiff was entitled to be compensated for the value of the contracted benefit of which he had been deprived . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

106	731	She was awarded damages as compensation for the vexation , anxiety and distress that the continuing molestation had caused her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	732	This , in my opinion , is a clear example of compensation for consequential loss within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time of the contract as liable to be caused by the solicitors ' failure to deal properly with the anti-molestation proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	735	96 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	736	In Cook v S Lord Denning MR said , at p 302 : `` if anything goes -LSB- wrong -RSB- with the litigation owing to the solicitor 's negligence ... -LSB- it -RSB- can be foreseen that there will be injured feelings ; mental distress ; anger and annoyance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

106	749	In R v Investors Compensation Scheme Ex parte Bowden -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 WLR 17 , 28 decided after Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 had been reported , Mann LJ said this : `` Unless the very object of the contract is as stated by Bingham LJ -LSB- at p 1445 -RSB- , then a contract breaker is not liable to compensate for mental and physical distress consequent upon his breach of contract . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	750	101 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	751	This statement is not , in my opinion , accurate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	752	It concentrates only on the first part and ignores the second part of Bingham LJ 's proposition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	753	I agree with Mann LJ that a contract relating to the investment of money is not such a contract as Bingham LJ had in mind as a contract `` the very object '' of which is to provide pleasure etc. . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	754	But if a breach of any contract has caused physical inconvenience or discomfort that is within the recognised rules of remoteness and mental distress is a part of that inconvenience or discomfort , it would , in my opinion , in principle be recoverable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

106	756	Mr Simpson referred to Johnson v Gore Wood & Co -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 2 WLR 72 , which he said was indistinguishable from the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	757	The case raised a number of difficult issues which have nothing whatever to do with the present case but the case did involve also a claim for damages for mental distress caused by solicitors ' negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	758	The alleged negligence was the solicitors ' failure to advise Mr Johnson , the client , about various financial matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	759	Mr Johnson claimed , among other heads of damage , damages `` for the mental distress and anxiety which he has suffered '' as a result of the alleged negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	760	Lord Bingham of Cornhill cited , at p 96 , the first two paragraphs of the passage from his own judgment in Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 , 1445 that I have cited at paragraph 20 above . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	761	He referred to Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 344 and said , at p 97 : `` It is undoubtedly true that many breaches of contract cause intense frustration and anxiety to the innocent party . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	762	103 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	763	He did not , however , think that Mr Johnson 's claim for damages for mental distress and anxiety came within the established principles for the recovery of such damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	764	104 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
106	765	The decision in Johnson v Gore Wood & Co -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 2 WLR 72 is , in my view , plainly distinguishable from the present . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	766	It was not , in my view , remotely arguable that Mr Johnson 's alleged mental distress was a consequence that , at the time he retained the solicitors , was reasonably in the contemplation of the parties as liable to result from a breach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	767	105 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	768	It is time for me to turn to the present case and apply the principles expressed in Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 344 and Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	769	In my judgment , Mr Farley is entitled to be compensated for the `` real discomfort '' that the judge found he suffered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	770	He is so entitled on either of two alternative bases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	771	106 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	772	First , he was deprived of the contractual benefit to which he was entitled . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	773	He was entitled to information about the aircraft noise from Gatwick bound aircraft that Mr Skinner , through negligence , had failed to supply him with . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	774	If Mr Farley had , in the event , decided not to purchase Riverside House , the value to him of the contractual benefit of which he had been deprived would have been nil . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	775	But he did buy the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	776	And he took his decision to do so without the advantage of being able to take into account the information to which he was contractually entitled . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	777	If he had had that information he would not have bought . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	778	So the information clearly would have had a value to him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	779	Prima facie , in my opinion , he is entitled to be compensated accordingly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	780	107 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	781	In these circumstances , it seems to me , it is open to the court to adopt a Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 344 approach and place a value on the contractual benefit of which Mr Farley has been deprived . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	782	In deciding on the amount , the discomfort experienced by Mr Farley can , in my view , properly be taken into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	783	If he had had the aircraft noise information he would not have bought Riverside House and would not have had that discomfort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	784	108 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	785	Alternatively , Mr Farley can , in my opinion , claim compensation for the discomfort as consequential loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	786	Had it not been for the breach of contract , he would not have suffered the discomfort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	787	It was caused by the breach of contract in a causa sine qua non sense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	788	Was the discomfort a consequence that should reasonably have been contemplated by the parties at the time of contract as liable to result from the breach ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	789	In my opinion , it was . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	790	It was obviously within the reasonable contemplation of the parties that , deprived of the information about aircraft noise that he ought to have had , Mr Farley would make a decision to purchase that he would not otherwise have made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	791	Having purchased , he would , having become aware of the noise , either sell - in which case at least the expenses of the re-sale would have been recoverable as damages - or he would keep the property and put up with the noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	792	In the latter event , it was within the reasonable contemplation of the parties that he would experience discomfort from the noise of the aircraft . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	793	And the discomfort was `` physical '' in the sense that Bingham LJ in Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 , 1445 had in mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	794	In my opinion , the application of Watts v Morrow principles entitles Mr Farley to damages for discomfort caused by the aircraft noise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	795	109 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	796	I would add that if there had been an appreciable reduction in the market value of the property caused by the aircraft noise , Mr Farley could not have recovered both that difference in value and damages for discomfort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	797	To allow both would allow double recovery for the same item . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	798	110 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	799	Whether the approach to damages is on Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 344 lines , for deprivation of a contractual benefit , or on Watts v Morrow -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 WLR 1421 lines , for consequential damage within the applicable remoteness rules , the appropriate amount should , in my opinion , be modest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	800	The degree of discomfort experienced by Mr Farley , although `` real '' , was not very great . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	801	I think # 10,000 may have been on the high side . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	802	But in principle , in my opinion , the judge was right to award damages and I am not , in the circumstances , disposed to disagree with his figure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	803	111 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
106	804	For the reasons I have given and for the reasons contained in the opinion of my noble and learned friend , Lord Steyn , I would allow the appeal and restore the judge 's order . 	lord scott	lord steyn	fullagr	1	NAN
