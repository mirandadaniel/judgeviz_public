87	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	4	The Sentence of the Judge On 24 November 1993 two young boys , Robert Thompson and Jon Venables , were convicted of the murder of a two year old boy , James Bulger . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	5	The murder had taken place on 12 February 1993 , when Thompson and Venables were 10 1/2 years old . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	6	Since a child under 10 can not be guilty of a criminal offence in English law , they were only just over the age of criminal responsibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	7	They were 11 years old at the time of their trial , which took place before Morland J. and a jury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	8	After conviction , the judge sentenced each of them to be detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure , such a sentence being mandatory in the case of young offenders convicted of murder : see section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	9	Before sentencing them , the judge said : `` Robert Thompson and Jon Venables , the killing of James Bulger was an act of unparalleled evil and barbarity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	10	`` This child of 2 was taken from his mother on a journey of over two miles and then , on the railway line , was battered to death without mercy and then his body was placed across the railway line so that his body would be run over by a train in an attempt to conceal his murder . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	11	In my judgment , your conduct was both cunning and very wicked . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	12	`` The sentence that I pass upon you both is that you shall be detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure in such a place and under such conditions as the Secretary of State may direct and that means that you will be securely detained for very , very many years until the Home Secretary is satisfied that you have matured and are fully rehabilitated and are no longer a danger to others . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	13	After sentencing them the judge continued , in their absence : `` How it came about that two mentally normal boys aged 10 of average intelligence committed this terrible crime is very hard to comprehend '' The Judge 's Report to the Home Secretary On 29 November 1993 the judge completed a Report on a standard form headed : `` Mandatory Life Sentence Case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	14	Trial Judge 's Report to the Home Secretary . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	15	In section 5 of the Report the judge provided , as required , a description of the offence and the circumstances in which it was committed , together with his assessment of the relative culpability of the two defendants , which was that he was unable to determine their relative culpability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	16	In section 10 he gave , again as required , his view on the actual length of detention necessary to meet the requirements of retribution and general deterrence for the offence -LRB- known as `` the penal element '' or `` the tariff '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	17	He wrote : `` If the defendants had been adults I would have said that the actual length of detention necessary to meet the requirements of retribution and general deterrence should have been 18 years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	18	`` In my judgment the appropriate actual length of detention necessary to meet the requirement -LSB- s -RSB- of retribution and general deterrence for the murder , taking into account all its appalling circumstances and the age of the defendants when it was committed is 8 years 8 years is ` very very many years ' for a ten or eleven year old . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	19	They are now children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	20	In 8 years ' time they will be young men . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	21	The advice of the Lord Chief Justice On 4 December 1993 the Lord Chief Justice , Lord Taylor of Gosforth , advised the Home Secretary that the penal element should be increased from 8 years to 10 years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	22	He wrote : `` I have well in mind that the trial judge is in a better position than I to assess these two boys and their crime ; also I agree that a much lesser tariff should apply than in the case of an adult . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	23	But I think the minimum period for punishment and deterrence should be 10 years . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	24	The decision of the Home Secretary Having received this advice from the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice , the Home Secretary , acting pursuant to his discretion under section 35 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 , and a Policy Statement dated 27 July 1993 , proceeded to consider the question of the penal element in the sentence for the two boys , and decided that it should be increased to 15 years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	25	In his Decision Letters , dated 22 July 1994 , it was stated that the Home Secretary had regard -LRB- inter alia -RRB- to : `` the public concern about this case , which was evidenced by the petitions and other correspondence the substance of which were disclosed to your solicitors by our letter of 16 June 1994 , and to the need to maintain confidence in the system of criminal justice . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	26	The letter dated 16 June 1994 referred in particular to a petition , signed by some 278,300 members of the public -LRB- with some 4,400 letters in support -RRB- urging that the two boys should remain in detention for life ; a petition , signed by nearly 6,000 members of the public , asking for a minimum period of detention of 25 years ; and over 20,000 coupons , cut out of a popular newspaper , together with over 1,000 letters , demanding a life tariff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	27	There were only 33 letters agreeing with the judiciary , or asking for a lower tariff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	28	The proceedings for judicial review Applications were then made on behalf of both Thompson and Venables to quash the decision of the Home Secretary on the penal element , and in addition to quash the consequential decision of the Home Secretary that the first review of their cases by the Parole Board should not take place until they had served 12 years in custody . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	29	In addition , it was submitted on behalf of Venables that the decision of the Home Secretary was in certain respects reached unfairly and in breach of the rules of natural justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	30	The decision of the Divisional Court The matter came before a Divisional Court consisting of Pill L.J. and Newman J . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	31	They concluded that a sentence on a young offender to be detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure pursuant to section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 created not only a power but a duty in the Secretary of State to keep the question of continued detention under review throughout the period of detention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	32	They further held that Part II of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 , in which such a sentence was assimilated with a sentence of mandatory life imprisonment , did not affect this characteristic of a sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	33	They accordingly held that the practice of the Home Secretary , expressed in a Policy Statement made by the present Home Secretary , Mr. Michael Howard , in July 1993 , that young offenders sentenced to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure should , like adults upon whom mandatory life sentences have been imposed , have to serve an identified penal element in their sentence before their release could be considered , was unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	34	They nevertheless rejected a submission that such detention was exclusively preventative and rehabilitative , and that punishment and deterrence should play no part in the Home Secretary 's decision upon a release date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	35	In delivering the judgment of the court , Pill L.J. said that the duty on the Secretary of State required him : `` not to make a fixed decision as to minimum length of detention at the commencement of the detention or to have an intention which can be changed only exceptionally . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	36	`` The rationale is in the requirement to have regard to the age of young offenders and , especially in the case of children , their change beyond recognition during a running of a tariff period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	37	When I say that the tariff of 15 years in this case is inappropriate , I am expressing a view not as to its merit by way of length but the lack of merit in fixing it at this stage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	38	Mr. Fitzgerald -LSB- counsel for Venables -RSB- did accept that the tariff figure recommended by Morland J. did not exclude the underlying purpose of the sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	39	It would provide a review after five years . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	40	In the result the Home Secretary 's decisions of 22 July 1994 were quashed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	41	The court expressed no opinion on the points concerned with unfairness or breach of natural justice because , in the light of their decision , those points did not arise for decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	42	The decision of the Court of Appeal The Secretary of State then appealed against that decision to the Court of Appeal -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 2 W.L.R. 67 , and the two applicants raised by way of respondents ' notices the issues of unfairness and breach of natural justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	43	The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	44	A majority -LRB- Hobhouse and Morritt L.JJ. , Lord Woolf M.R. dissenting -RRB- held that the conclusion of the Divisional Court on what I shall call the main issue -- that the concept of a penal element in the sentence which must be served could not stand with the continuing duty of the Secretary of State to keep the detention of the detainee under continuous review -- must be rejected as inconsistent with the intention of Parliament as expressed in Part II of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	45	Lord Woolf M.R. , in his dissenting judgment on this point , took a different view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	46	He too rejected the argument that punishment formed no part of a sentence to detention under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- ; and he accepted that it was not unlawful for the Secretary of State to adopt , in relation to young offenders so sentenced , a policy involving the identification of a penal element in the sentence which the detainee would have to serve . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	47	He said , at p. 90 : `` This is because it allows a young offender to know the period during which he is unlikely to be released and when he should prepare himself to put forward representations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	48	The objection which is most often made by those subject to an indeterminate sentence is its uncertainty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	49	They need a target date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	50	It is also sensible from the administrator 's point of view In addition it identifies the penal element which perfectly properly the young offender can normally be expected to serve by way of punishment . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	51	In his opinion , however , the difference between a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment and a mandatory sentence of detention for a young offender can be accommodated in the application of the policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	52	This required that the policy must not be so inflexible that it can not accommodate the range of situations to which it has to apply , nor must it be so rigid that it does not allow for exceptional cases ; otherwise it will result in an unlawful fetter on the discretion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	53	In the present case , to postpone review for 12 years was unacceptable , though it would be different if there were to be a general reconsideration during the period of the tariff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	54	If the decision to fix the tariff was taken on limited material , that would make reconsideration all the more important . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	55	The position of adults was different , because their circumstances do not change to the same extent as do those of children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	56	In the present case there was an almost irresistible case for considering whether the tariff approach should not exceptionally be departed from . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	57	It appears that either the ability to depart from the tariff was not appreciated or , if it was appreciated , it was not considered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	58	In the circumstances , it was necessary for the majority to consider whether there had been procedural unfairness or a breach of natural justice by the Secretary of State ; and the Master of the Rolls also considered these questions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	59	All three members of the court considered that such breaches had occurred , though they were not all agreed on their identity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
87	60	In the result , therefore , it was on these grounds that the Divisional Court 's decision was upheld and the Secretary of State 's appeal was dismissed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	61	I shall in due course refer to the matters in question when I come to consider this aspect of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	62	The appeal to the House of Lords Before your Lordships , therefore , the Secretary of State was the appellant on the issues of procedural unfairness and breach of natural justice , and the two defendants were cross-appellants on the main issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	63	I propose however to consider first the main issue which arises on the cross-appeal , and then to turn to the issues arising on the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	64	An overview Before I turn to consider the main issue , I wish to preface my consideration of it with certain introductory comments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	65	In the present case , we see a marked divergence between the successive penal elements chosen as appropriate for these two defendants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	66	The judge selected a period of 8 years ' detention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	67	He expressed the opinion that , had they been adults , the appropriate period would have been 18 years , but reduced this to 8 years for these two children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	68	In his sentencing remarks , he warned them that they would be detained for `` very , very many years '' ; and in his Report to the Home Secretary he stated that 8 years is `` very , very many years '' for a ten or eleven year old . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	69	It may justly be said that 8 years is a very long time for a boy of that age ; but I doubt very much if ordinary people would think that 8 years was `` very , very many years . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	70	Hobhouse L.J. thought that , as a result of the judge 's sentencing remarks , the public may well have been surprised when it was later revealed in the press that the judge had recommended a period of detention of no more than 8 years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	71	I am inclined to agree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	72	At all events , a press campaign then developed in which demands were made that the two respondents should remain in detention or custody for the rest of their lives . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	73	The Lord Chief Justice , when he came to express an opinion on the penal element , concluded that , despite the fact that the judge had had the benefit of presiding over the trial and therefore a fuller opportunity of assessing the two defendants , nevertheless the penal element in their sentence should be increased to 10 years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	74	Since he agreed with the judge that a much lesser tariff should apply than in the case of an adult , it is not difficult to infer that he thought that the period of 18 years chosen by the judge for the hypothetical adult offender was considerably too low . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	75	It may not be without significance that the period chosen by him would have the effect that the two defendants ' cases would fall to be reviewed when they were 18 years old , and their release would be possible when they were 21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	76	He did not , therefore , contemplate the possibility that the penal element requiring their continued detention should persist after they had come of age . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	77	It is against this background that the choice by the Secretary of State of a penal element of 15 years has to be seen . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	78	We know that he , like -LRB- in all probability -RRB- the Lord Chief Justice , thought that the judge 's figure for an adult was too short ; he preferred a period of 25 years to the judge 's 18 years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	79	But he then proceeded to select a period of 15 years for the two boys . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	80	This is a period which is 50 per cent longer than that chosen by the Lord Chief Justice , who had already significantly increased that chosen by the judge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	81	Such an increase must be regarded as very substantial ; moreover it extended the almost inevitable period of their detention for a number of years after the time when they would become adults . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	82	It is obvious however that the Secretary of State chose this figure in good faith as the appropriate figure for the penal element , having reduced the figure from 25 years to 15 years to allow for the fact that they were children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	83	I have specifically referred to these matters , because it appears to me that the real complaint of the two respondents is not so much against the fact that the Home Secretary specified a penal element which had to be served by them before they might be released under licence , as against the length of the period chosen by him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	84	As appears from the judgment of the Divisional Court , there was no complaint against the period recommended by the trial judge ; and it may be that the period recommended by the Lord Chief Justice might also have been reluctantly accepted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	85	However , the ground upon which the Divisional Court held that the Home Secretary 's decisions should be quashed was that he had no power to impose any penal element . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	86	I shall bear these considerations in mind when I address the question of statutory construction which arises on the main issue in this appeal , to which I now turn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	87	Judgments - Reg . v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte V. and Reg . v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte T. continued The relevant statutory provisions : the Children Act 1908 and the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	88	I start with the Children Act 1908 , and the subsequent consolidating Act , the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	89	It was under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the latter Act -LRB- as amended -RRB- that the two respondents in the present case were sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure ; but since that subsection reflects without material alteration section 103 of the Act of 1908 , it is right that I should begin with the earlier statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	90	Sections 103-105 of that Act provide as follows : `` 103 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN

87	99	Section 53 in its original form provided as follows : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- Sentence of death shall not be pronounced on or recorded against a person under the age of eighteen years , but in lieu thereof the court shall sentence him to be detained during His Majesty 's pleasure , and , if so sentenced , he shall , notwithstanding anything in the other provisions of this Act , be liable to be detained in such place and under such conditions as the Secretary of State may direct .

87	105	Section 53 was subsequently amended in certain respects . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	106	First , following the abolition of the death penalty in 1965 , section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- was amended -LRB- by sections 1 -LRB- 5 -RRB- and 4 of the Murder -LRB- Abolition of Death Penalty -RRB- Act 1965 -RRB- to make a sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure mandatory , in place of a mandatory life sentence , for young offenders convicted of murder . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	107	Second , following the introduction of the Parole Board by the Criminal Justice Act 1967 , the power to release young offenders sentenced under section 53 of the Act of 1933 was made dependent upon a recommendation by the Board and , in the case of those sentenced to imprisonment for life or to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure , prior consultation with the Lord Chief Justice and -LRB- if available -RRB- the trial judge : see section 61 of the Act of 1967 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	108	Finally , the whole regime was subject to major revision in Part II of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	109	The relevant provisions of that Act are of great importance in the present case ; but the form of section 53 of the Act of 1933 -LRB- as previously amended -RRB- was left untouched . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	110	Before I turn to the impact of the Act of 1991 , I wish first to consider section 53 itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	111	First of all , I am satisfied that the submission of Mr. Fitzgerald Q.C. for Venables that a sentence to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- contains no element of punishment is unsustainable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	112	Section 104 of the Act of 1908 , which is the direct precursor of section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 , expressly refers to cases in which punishment provided for elsewhere in the Act is insufficient . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	113	It is plain , therefore , that a sentence under section 104 involved punishment of the young offender ; and this is all the more obvious when it is seen that , among the lesser sentences which might then be imposed , was a sentence of whipping -LRB- see section 107 -LRB- g -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	114	That being so , it is inconceivable that a sentence of detention under section 103 for the greater offence of murder should not likewise involve punishment of the offender . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	115	Furthermore , there is nothing in section 53 of the Act of 1933 to indicate that any different conclusion should be drawn in respect of a sentence of detention under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- ; on the contrary , consistently with that conclusion , section 53 is headed by the words `` Punishment of certain grave crimes . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	116	Since , therefore , a sentence of detention under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- involves punishment , it is difficult at first sight to see why , as a matter of policy , the Home Secretary should not be entitled to identify a penal element and require that it should be served before release on licence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	117	I turn next to the conclusion of the Divisional Court that a sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- connotes `` not only a power but a duty in the Secretary of State to keep the question of continued detention under review throughout the period of detention , '' with the effect that the imposition of a penal element which must be served before release is inconsistent with such a sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	118	In my opinion this conclusion flows from a misunderstanding of the applicable legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	119	I have read with great interest the paper prepared by Professor A. W. B. Simpson for submission to the European Court of Human Rights in Prem Singh v. United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	120	The theme of the paper is that a sentence on a young offender -LRB- whether under section 103 of the Act of 1908 or section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 -RRB- to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure should not be viewed as equivalent to a mandatory life sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	121	That the two should be differentiated is explained in the paper , essentially because the introduction of such a sentence for young offenders `` formed part of an elaborate legislative scheme which reflected a general policy of treating young offenders quite differently from older ones '' -LRB- see page 22 -RRB- .

87	122	A similar policy no doubt underlay the amendment to section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- in 1965 to make a sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure mandatory , in place of a mandatory life sentence , for young offenders convicted of murder . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	123	But this policy relates to `` making a special arrangement for the disposal of juvenile murderers '' -LRB- see page 26 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	124	It does not relate to arrangements for their discharge ; indeed it would be surprising if it did so because , unlike the case of young offenders , detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure as originally applied to lunatics was regarded as purely preventative , and so was an interim order pending their release if they recovered -LRB- see pages 13-14 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	125	In such cases , continuous review was no doubt necessary -LRB- see page 13 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	126	But the same does not necessarily apply in the case of young offenders , where the sentence involves punishment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	127	At all events , the position is made clear in both the Act of 1908 and the Act of 1933 , where the power of discharge is expressly provided for , and is a power vested in the Secretary of State to discharge the young offender at any time on licence , subject to revocation of that licence by him at any time - see section 53 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 -LRB- now repealed -RRB- , formerly section 105 of the Act of 1908 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	128	Furthermore , these statutory provisions for discharge are likewise applicable to sentences of detention under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 , formerly section 104 of the Act of 1908 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	129	In my opinion , the adoption of the expression `` during Her Majesty 's pleasure '' in relation to one form of detention under the Acts of 1908 and 1933 can not of itself give rise to any impact upon discharge , when identical provision is expressly made in each statute for a power of discharge applicable to both forms of detention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	130	Furthermore , no implication can in my opinion be derived from these words that cases of detention for murder under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 -LRB- or under section 103 of the Act of 1908 -RRB- should be kept under continuous review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	131	It would be most extraordinary if the presence of these words in the sections applicable in cases of murder should have that effect , when the absence of those words in section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- or section 104 -RRB- should have the effect that offenders sentenced to detention for life for lesser offences under those provisions would be deprived of the benefit of any such review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	132	That no distinction can be drawn in this way between the two provisions is made plain by the fact that , in the days before the time when identification of a penal element in the sentence was considered desirable , the flexible regime applicable to young offenders was considered to be equally appropriate to those sentenced under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	133	This is made plain in the decision of the Court of Appeal -LRB- Criminal Division -RRB- in Reg . v. Fuat -LSB- 1973 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 1045 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	134	There the Court of Appeal upheld a sentence of 20 years detention imposed under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- on a 16 year old boy held guilty of attempted murder and robbery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	135	In the course of his judgment , Lord Widgery C.J. -LRB- at pp. 1049 et seq. -RRB- stressed that section 53 created : `` an entirely flexible procedure in which , as the subject develops and his character matures , the Home Secretary can direct him to appropriate training and eventually secure his release when that release is possible and consistent with the safety of the public . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	136	This was as true of a young offender sentenced to life or a fixed period of detention under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- as it was of one sentenced to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	137	In this connection , Lord Widgery C.J. relied upon a passage from the judgment of Lord Parker C.J. in Reg . v. Chambers ; Reg . v. Sorsby -LRB- 1967 -RRB- 51 Cr.App.R . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	138	254 , 256 , when he said of sentences under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- : `` Although these sentences take the form of ten years and twelve years fixed terms , it is quite clear that under the Children and Young Persons Act -LSB- 1933 -RSB- the Home Secretary has an absolute discretion at any time to let them out on licence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	139	As the learned judge said , he was giving these sentences in order in effect to make them into indeterminate sentences whereby the Home Secretary could , whenever it was thought safe , let these boys out . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	140	It follows that the flexible procedures then applied did not owe their origin to the fact that some young offenders -LRB- those sentenced under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- were sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	141	On the contrary , they applied to all young offenders , whether sentenced under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- or section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	142	Indeed , it would have been most surprising if any distinction had in this respect been drawn between the two categories of young offenders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	143	In more recent years , it has been recognised in the case of adult prisoners that it is desirable to fix a penal element which has to be served before release , a policy which has been recognised by your Lordships ' House to be unobjectionable -LRB- see Reg . v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte Doody -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 A.C. 531 , 559C , per Lord Mustill -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	144	As Lord Woolf M.R. pointed out in his dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal in the present case , there can be no legal objection to the Home Secretary applying the same approach to young offenders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	145	As I have already recorded , he said , at p. 90 : `` This is because it allows a young offender to know the period during which he is unlikely to be released and when he should prepare himself to put forward representations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	146	The objection which is most often made by those subject to an indeterminate sentence is its uncertainty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	147	They need a target date . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	148	It would be very strange if the benefit -LRB- such as it is -RRB- of such a policy should be available to young offenders sentenced to detention for life under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , but not to those sentenced to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	149	Certainly , I can derive no such conclusion from the words `` during Her Majesty 's pleasure . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	150	For these reasons , quite apart from the impact of the Act of 1991 , I am unable to accept the reasoning or conclusion of the Divisional Court on this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	151	The relevant legislation : the Criminal Justice Act 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	152	It is against that background that I now turn to the impact on these cases of Part II of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 , which in my opinion puts the matter beyond all doubt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	153	The Act made important changes in respect of the administration of criminal justice in this country ; but it is Part II of the Act , concerned with the early release of prisoners , with which your Lordships are directly concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	154	In order to understand the relevant provisions of the Act , however , it is necessary that I should first refer to developments in the policy applied by successive Home Secretaries in relation to release on licence , and to a decision of the European Court of Human Rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	155	First of all , in a statement made by Mr. Leon Brittan on 30 November 1983 , he stated that , in the case of life sentence prisoners , he looked to the judiciary for advice on the period to be served to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence and to the Parole Board for advice on risk . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	156	This appears to have been the origin of the penal element or `` tariff . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	157	He further stated that the first review by the Local Review Committee would normally take place three years before the expiry of that period , which would give time for preparation for release if the Parole Board recommended it , having considered risk . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	158	The ultimate discretion when to release would remain with the Home Secretary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	159	This policy was further developed in a statement by Mr. Douglas Hurd on 23 July 1987 , following the decision of a Divisional Court in Reg . v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte Handscomb -LRB- 1988 -RRB- 86 Cr.App.R . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	160	59 , which was concerned with discretionary life sentences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	161	Next , following the decision of your Lordships ' House in Reg . v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte Doody -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 A.C. 531 , a statement was made by Mr. Michael Howard on 27 July 1993 giving effect to that decision -LRB- with which your Lordships are not here directly concerned -RRB- , in which he reiterated -LRB- with amendments -RRB- the policy with regard to the penal element referred to in previous policy statements in relation to mandatory life sentence cases , and concluded with the following words : `` Everything that I have said about the practice of the Secretary of State in relation to mandatory life sentence prisoners applies equally to persons who are , or will be , detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 , as well as to persons who have been , or will be , sentenced to custody for life under section 8 of the Criminal Justice Act 1982 . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	162	Finally , I must refer to the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Thynne , Wilson and Gunnell v. United Kingdom -LRB- 1990 -RRB- 13 E.H.R.R. 666 , in which it was held that , in the case of discretionary life sentence prisoners the penal element in whose sentences has expired , their continued detention should be subject to judicial control by virtue of Article 5 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	163	It is against this background that the effect of Part II of the Act of 1991 can be understood . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	164	Section 34 of the Act is concerned with the release of discretionary life prisoners , and it is plain that this section has been drafted to give effect to the decision of the European Court in Thynne . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	165	Although the section is drafted with reference to the requirement that a part of the prisoner 's sentence is to be served before his release is considered , nevertheless that part is to be determined by the court which sentenced him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	166	Furthermore , once he has served that part of his sentence , and the Parole Board has directed his release , it is the duty of the Secretary of State to release him ; and a discretionary life prisoner may require the Secretary of State to refer his case to the Board at any time after -LRB- inter alia -RRB- he has served the relevant part of his sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	167	It follows that , in the case of such prisoners , the question of his release has been entirely `` judicialised '' , to use the current jargon . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	168	The case of mandatory life prisoners is dealt with in section 35 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and -LRB- 3 -RRB- , which provide as follows : '' -LRB- 2 -RRB- If recommended to do so by the Board , the Secretary of State may , after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice together with the trial judge if available , release on licence a life prisoner who is not a discretionary life prisoner . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	169	-LRB- 3 -RRB- The Board shall not make a recommendation under subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- above unless the Secretary of State has referred the particular case , or the class of case to which that case belongs , to the Board for its advice . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	170	It is apparent that , in such cases , the Secretary of State retains his discretion both when to refer a case to the Parole Board and , if the Board recommends his release , whether to release him as so recommended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	171	Section 43 is concerned with Young Offenders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	172	Subsections -LRB- 1 -RRB- , -LRB- 2 -RRB- and -LRB- 3 -RRB- provide as follows : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- Subject to subsections -LRB- 4 -RRB- and -LRB- 5 -RRB- below , this Part -LSB- II -RSB- applies to persons serving sentences of detention in a young offender institution , or determinate sentences of detention under section 53 of the 1933 Act , as it applies to persons serving equivalent sentences of imprisonment . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	173	-LRB- 2 -RRB- Subject to subsection -LRB- 5 -RRB- below , this Part applies to persons serving - -LRB- a -RRB- sentences of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure or for life under section 53 of the 1933 Act ; or -LRB- b -RRB- sentences of custody for life under section 8 of the 1982 Act , as it applies to persons serving sentences of imprisonment for life . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	174	-LRB- 3 -RRB- References in this Part to prisoners -LRB- whether short-term , long-term or life prisoners -RRB- , or to prison or imprisonment , shall be construed in accordance with subsections -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- above . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	175	Subsections -LRB- 4 -RRB- and -LRB- 5 -RRB- refer respectively to short-term prisoners under the age of 18 years , and persons under the age of 22 years who are released on licence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	176	It follows therefore that Part II of the Act -LRB- which is concerned with the Early Release of Prisoners -RRB- applies both to young offenders sentenced to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 and to those sentenced to detention for life under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	177	However , since the sentence on the former is a mandatory sentence , and the sentence on the latter is discretionary , their cases fall to be considered under different sections of the Act -- the former under section 35 , and the latter under section 34 -LRB- as is made plain by section 51 -LRB- 1 -RRB- which provides that '' ` life prisoner ' has the meaning given by section 34 -LRB- 7 -RRB- above -LRB- as extended by section 43 -LRB- 2 -RRB- above -RRB- '' -LRB- emphasis added -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	178	The practical result is that young offenders sentenced to detention for life fall within the judicialised regime in section 34 , which makes express provision for the fixing of a part of the sentence which must be served before release , whereas those sentenced to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure fall to be considered by the Secretary of State under the broad discretion now conferred upon him by section 35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	179	Although the regime now applicable under the statute to the latter class of young offenders is that applicable in the case of adult life prisoners subject to mandatory life sentences -LRB- i.e. , adult murderers -RRB- , it would not , in my opinion , be strictly correct to describe such young offenders as subject to a life sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
87	180	What has happened is that Parliament has recognised that sentences to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- have sufficient similarity to sentences of life imprisonment imposed upon adults to render it appropriate that the question of release should in both cases be provided for in the same statutory provision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	181	This is no doubt because in both cases a mandatory sentence of indeterminate length has been imposed for murder , and if release is permitted on licence that licence will remain thereafter revocable by the Secretary of State for the rest of the offender 's natural life -- as is made plain by section 37 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Act , which is rendered applicable to young offenders detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure by section 43 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and -LRB- 3 -RRB- and section 51 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	182	Judgments - Reg . v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte V. and Reg . v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte T. continued There is nothing in the Act of 1991 to suggest that the discretion vested in the Secretary of State by section 35 is to be the subject of any special criteria when he considers the cases of young murderers sentenced to detention under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 , as opposed to adult murderers sentenced to mandatory life imprisonment in the ordinary way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	183	Certainly there is nothing in section 35 itself to suggest that that is the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	184	Furthermore , there are contrary indications in the statute when provision is made for those serving determinate sentences and those sentenced to discretionary life imprisonment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	185	The early release of young offenders sentenced to determinate sentences of detention under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- is governed by section 33 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- and section 35 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , applicable to short term and long-term prisoners . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	186	It is true that Parliament , in section 43 -LRB- 4 -RRB- and -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the Act of 1991 , made special provision for young offenders ; but that only emphasises the fact that , subject to such special provisions , the cases of such young offenders are governed by the provisions in the statute for adults serving similar terms of imprisonment : see section 43 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	187	Even more striking , however , is the fact that the release of young offenders sentenced to detention for life under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 falls to be considered under section 34 , under which Parliament has made express provision for a part of the sentence to be identified and served before they can be released : see section 34 -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	188	It is , in my opinion , inconceivable that Parliament should have so provided in the case of those sentenced to detention for life under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , while contemplating that no penal element could be required to be served by young offenders convicted of the graver offence of murder under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	189	Plainly , in my opinion , Parliament proceeded on the basis that the Secretary of State was free to apply -LRB- as he had done in the past -RRB- a sentencing policy under section 35 which required the identification of a penal element which must be served before release , and was as free to apply that policy to murderers who were young offenders as he was in the case of adult murderers ; and , having regard to the legislative history to which I have already referred , Parliament was fully entitled to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	190	For these reasons , I find myself to be in agreement with the majority of the Court of Appeal on the main issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	191	I wish to add that none of this means that the Secretary of State is entitled to ignore the fact that the offender in question is a young offender . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	192	It was , of course , for this reason that he reduced the penal element for the two respondents from 25 years -LRB- considered appropriate for an adult who had committed a similar offence -RRB- to 15 years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	193	Moreover , the fact that the Secretary of State specifies a penal element which has to be served by a young offender sentenced to detention under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 does not mean that his welfare or rehabilitation are being ignored . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	194	On the contrary , a regime is established for his detention which is specifically directed towards matters of this kind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	195	But it does mean that good progress during detention does not have the effect of reducing the penal period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	196	That is regarded as being consistent with the nature of punishment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	197	This is no doubt why , under the statutory regime in section 34 which is applicable in the case of young offenders sentenced to life imprisonment under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 , no provision is made for any such reduction , the only statutory power of release during the penal period being on compassionate grounds : see section 36 , which is equally applicable to discretionary life prisoners and to mandatory life prisoners -LRB- including young offenders sentenced to detention under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	198	It would be very strange if the Secretary of State should be required , when exercising his discretion under section 35 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , to take account of good progress during detention with a view to reducing the penal period in the case of a young offender who is a murderer , when that course has not been made available by Parliament in the case of a young offender sentenced to detention for life for a lesser offence , for example , one who has attempted to kill but has only succeeded in maiming his victim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	199	I can not believe that Parliament should have contemplated so extraordinary and anomalous a differentiation as this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	200	For the same reasons I do not , with all respect , feel able to accept the reasoning of Lord Woolf M.R. in his dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	201	Since there is no basis in the statute for departure , on the ground of good progress during detention , from a penal element set under section 34 in the case of a young offender sentenced to detention for life under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 , Parliament can not have contemplated that the Secretary of State should , in the exercise of his discretion under section 35 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , have been bound to consider departing , on the ground of good progress during detention , from a penal period specified by him in respect of a young offender sentenced to detention for the greater offence of murder under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- .

87	223	The report related to Thompson , and was voluntarily sent to the Secretary of State ; but it concluded that that no reliable view could be reached about Thompson 's state of mind at the material time , and the Secretary of State understandably concluded that it did not assist him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	224	There was , in my opinion , no unfairness in not disclosing it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN

87	226	Again there is , in my opinion , no substance in this point , which was not previously relied upon by the respondents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	227	The Secretary of State is fully entitled to have regard to other comparable cases , and there is no suggestion that disclosure of a particular case would have enabled the respondents to advance any further representations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	228	-LRB- 2 -RRB- Failure by the Secretary of State himself to obtain material in the form of psychiatric or other reports . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	229	In my opinion , there is no duty on the Secretary of State to obtain such reports in every case , though sometimes it may be desirable for him to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	230	In the present case , the Secretary of State had the benefit of the assessment by the trial judge , who expressed his views to the Secretary of State based upon detailed reports and upon the evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	231	It must not be forgotten that the judge had the benefit of presiding over the whole trial , and hearing the whole evidence and submissions by counsel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	232	It is plain that the Secretary of State formed the opinion that he , like the Lord Chief Justice , could safely proceed upon the basis of the judge 's assessment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	233	His view that he could do so was reinforced by the conclusion reached in the psychiatric report voluntarily sent to him , in which the opinion was expressed that no reliable conclusion could be reached about Thompson 's state of mind at the relevant time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	234	In my opinion , the Secretary of State was entitled to form this view and act upon it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	235	In any event , the Secretary of State has stated that if any information of a psychiatric nature comes to light which is relevant to the tariff , it will be considered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	236	In all the circumstances , I can see no unfairness in this respect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	237	-LRB- 3 -RRB- Having regard to petitions and other material . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	238	As I have already indicated , I see great substance in this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	239	I will therefore consider it in some detail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	240	It is plain from his Decision Letters that the Secretary of State did indeed have regard , when he made his decision to fix the penal element in the respondents ' sentences at 15 years , to the petitions and letters to which I have already referred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	241	As stated in the Decision Letters , he did so as evidence of the public concern about this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	242	That there was public concern about this terrible case , there can be no doubt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	243	Any humane person must have felt , not only the deepest sympathy for little James Bulger and his family , but horror that two boys as young as the two respondents should have perpetrated such a brutal crime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	244	The Home Secretary hardly needed the media to inform him of this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	245	But events such as this tend to provoke a desire for revenge , and calls for the infliction of the severest punishment upon the perpetrators of the crime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	246	This elemental feeling is perhaps natural , though in today 's society there is a tendency for it to be whipped up and exploited by the media . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	247	When this happens , it can degenerate into something less acceptable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	248	Little credit can be given to favourable responses to a campaign that the two respondents should `` rot in jail '' for the rest of their lives , especially when it is borne in mind that those who responded may well have been unaware that , even after the penal element in their sentences had been served , their release would not be automatic but would be the subject of very careful consideration by the responsible authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	249	It was the submission of Mr. Fitzgerald for Venables that material such as that which the Secretary of State had regard to in the present case was no more than public clamour , and as such worthless . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	250	It should therefore have been disregarded by the Secretary of State . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	251	In the Court of Appeal this submission was accepted by Lord Woolf M.R. and Hobhouse L.J. , but rejected by Morritt L.J. I approach the matter as follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	252	Under section 35 of the Act of 1991 , the Secretary of State has a discretion regarding the release of mandatory life prisoners , including young offenders sentenced to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	253	In the case of such prisoners , there is no statutory provision requiring the fixing of a penal element which must be served . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	254	That arises from the policy that there should be such an element , first established by Mr. Leon Brittan in 1983 , and subsequently continued by later Secretaries of State . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	255	It may therefore be said that the same considerations apply to the implementation of this policy as apply to the decision to release when taken in cases such as these . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	256	Moreover , in Reg . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	257	v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte Doody -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 A.C. 531 , 559 , Lord Mustill , speaking of the Secretary of State 's discretion with regard to release , spoke of the Secretary of State as being entitled `` to have regard to broader considerations of a public character than those which apply to an ordinary sentencing function '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	258	Even so , when it comes to fixing the penal element , different considerations apply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	259	In doing so , the Secretary of State is not looking at the whole picture at the material time when deciding whether in all the circumstances it is appropriate for a life prisoner to be released , when considerations of a broader character may properly be relevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	260	On the contrary , he is deciding what in future will be the period of time which a prisoner must serve , compassionate considerations apart , before he may be released , if it is then thought fit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	261	It is scarcely surprising that , in Ex parte Doody , at p. 557 , Lord Mustill said of this exercise that : `` Even if the Home Secretary still retains his controlling discretion as regards the assessment of culpability the fixing of the penal element begins to look much more like an orthodox sentencing exercise , and less like a general power exercised completely at large . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	262	Furthermore this approach derives strong support from the statutory context in which the discretion is now to be found . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	263	For in the same Part -LSB- II -RSB- of the same statute , the fixing of the penal element for discretionary life prisoners is , by section 34 of the Act of 1991 , performed by the judges . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	264	They will undoubtedly act in a judicial manner when doing so ; and indeed that they should do so must have been the intention of Parliament when entrusting this function to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	265	In so doing , they will disregard any evidence of the kind now under consideration as irrelevant and prejudicial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	266	It follows that , if the Secretary of State was right to have regard to it , there will exist an extraordinary and anomalous conflict between neighbouring sections , sections 34 and 35 , in the same statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	267	It is , in my opinion , impossible to explain this conflict on the basis that a relevant distinction is to be drawn in this context between discretionary and mandatory life sentences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	268	In my opinion the only way in which the conflict can be resolved is by recognising that , if the Secretary of State implements a policy of fixing a penal element of the sentence of a mandatory life prisoner pursuant to his discretionary power under section 35 , he is to this extent exercising a function which is closely analogous to a sentencing function with the effect that , when so doing , he is under a duty to act within the same constraints as a judge will act when exercising the same function . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	269	In particular , should he take into account public clamour directed towards the decision in the particular case which he has under consideration , he will be having regard to an irrelevant consideration which will render the exercise of his discretion unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	270	In so holding , I wish to draw a distinction in the present context between public concern of a general nature with regard to , for example , the prevalence of certain types of offence , and the need that those who commit such offences should be duly punished ; and public clamour that a particular offender whose case is under consideration should be singled out for severe punishment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	271	It is legitimate for a sentencing authority to take the former concern into account , but not the latter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	272	In my opinion , by crossing the boundary from one type of public concern to the other , the Secretary of State erred in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	273	In reaching this conclusion , I find myself to be in substantial agreement with the opinion expressed by Lord Woolf M.R. on this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	274	For these reasons , I would dismiss the appeal of the Secretary of State . 	lord goff	self	outcome	0.2	NAN

87	277	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	278	Introduction The murder of James Bulger by the two applicants , Robert Thompson and Jon Venables , was a cruel and sadistic crime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	279	It is made even more horrific by the fact that the applicants were only 10 1/2 years old at the time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	280	It is not surprising that the case has given rise to much public concern and , indeed , outrage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	281	There is room for a wide range of attitudes to the proper treatment of the two murderers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	282	At one extreme there are those who consider that , even though the applicants were only 10 1/2 years old at the time , the crime was so terrible that they should spend the rest of their life in detention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	283	At the other extreme , there are those who take the view that punishment as such is inappropriate for those of such tender age as the applicants and that the treatment that they should receive should be purely remedial , save so far as the public need to be protected from risk . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	284	I suspect that most people take a view somewhere between these two extremes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	285	It can not be too strongly emphasised that it is not for the courts or for your Lordships ' House to determine how long these two boys should be detained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	286	Parliament has laid down in section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 -LRB- as amended -RRB- that a child shall not be sentenced to life imprisonment but in lieu thereof the courts shall sentence him to be detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	287	That is the sentence which has been passed on these two applicants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	288	It is accepted by all parties that the decision how long the two applicants shall remain subject to detention is a decision which lies within the discretion of the Secretary of State , i.e. the Home Secretary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	289	By decision letters dated 22 July 1994 the Secretary of State determined that the applicants should be detained for a minimum of 15 years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	290	The question is not whether your Lordships agree that such a period is appropriate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	291	The only question is whether the Secretary of State acted lawfully in fixing that period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	292	Judgments - Reg . v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte V. and Reg . v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte T. continued The discretion to release Although there is dispute as to the meaning of the sentence of detention `` during Her Majesty 's pleasure , '' no doubt surrounds the discretion of the Secretary of State to release such a prisoner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	293	Under section 43 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 , the provisions of Part II of the Act of 1991 -LRB- relating to the release of adult prisoners serving life sentences -RRB- are made applicable to children who are serving sentences of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	294	The Secretary of State may release the detained child if recommended to do so by the Parole Board and after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge if available : section 35 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the A1ct of 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	295	Before the Parole Board can make any such recommendation , the Secretary of State has to refer the case to the Board for its advice : section 35 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Act of 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	296	Therefore the release of a child detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure is wholly dependent on , first , the Secretary of State exercising a discretion whether or not to refer the case to the Parole Board and , second , the Secretary of State deciding whether or not to adopt any recommendation made by the Parole Board that the detained person should be released . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	297	If the Secretary of State determines to release a person detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure , such release is made on licence which may either be conditional or unconditional . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	298	If unconditional , the licence remains in force until his death unless , in the meantime , it has been revoked by the Secretary of State on one of the grounds laid down in section 39 of the Act of 1991 : see section 37 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Act of 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	299	Under section 39 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- once the Secretary of State has released on licence , apart from cases of emergency , he can revoke that licence so as to recall the former detainee only upon the recommendation of the Parole Board . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
87	300	If the detainee is recalled , he has a right to have his case considered by the Board and , if the Board so recommends , to be released by the Secretary of State on licence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	301	Therefore the effect of a sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure is : -LRB- a -RRB- the child is to be detained for an indeterminate period , the duration of which is wholly within the discretion of the Home Secretary ; and -LRB- b -RRB- when the Home Secretary , on the recommendation of the Parole Board , releases the detainee on licence , the detainee is liable to be recalled throughout his life but such recall is subject to the decision of the Parole Board and not within the discretion of the Home Secretary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	302	The policy of the Secretary of State -LRB- a -RRB- The tariff Over the years , the Secretary of State has adopted a tariff policy in exercising his discretion whether to release adults who have been sentenced to life imprisonment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	303	This was first publicly announced in Parliament by Mr. Leon Brittan on 30 November 1983 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	304	In essence , the tariff approach is this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	305	The life sentence is broken down into component parts , viz. , retribution , deterrence and protection of the public . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	306	The trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice advise the Secretary of State as to the sentence which would be appropriate for the crime having regard to the elements of retribution and deterrence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	307	In the light of that advice -LRB- and not being in any way bound by it -RRB- the Secretary of State makes his own decision as to the minimum period which the prisoner will have to serve in order to satsify the requirements of retribution and deterrence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	308	This is the tariff period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	309	The policy provides that , until three years before the tariff period expires , the Secretary of State will not refer the case to the Parole Board for its advice as to whether the prisoner should or should not be released . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	310	Moreover , until the tariff period has expired the Secretary of State will not exercise his discretion to release on licence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	311	This basic approach to adult prisoners has developed over the years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	312	In particular , as a result of the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Thynne , Wilson and Gunnell v. United Kingdom 13 E.H.R.R. 666 , a distinction has had to be drawn between murderers for whom the sentence of life imprisonment is mandatory under English law and others sentenced to life imprisonment where the sentence is not mandatory and has been imposed by the judge because he considers that the prisoner may , if released after a determinate sentence appropriate to the crime , present a continuing risk to society -LRB- a discretionary life sentence -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	313	The Strasbourg Court held that under Article 5 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the European Convention on Human Rights a discretionary life prisoner who had served the tariff period was entitled to have the question whether his continuing detention thereafter on the grounds of risk was justified determined by `` a court . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	314	In order to comply with this decision , Part II of the Act of 1991 was passed by Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	315	It provides that the treatment of discretionary life prisoners is -LRB- to use an unpleasant but invaluable word -RRB- `` judicialised . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	316	In the case of discretionary life prisoners , the tariff is fixed by the trial judge and the risk after expiry of the tariff period is determined by the Parole Board , to whom the Secretary of State is bound to refer the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	317	The Secretary of State is bound to release the discretionary life prisoner if the Parole Board so directs : see section 34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	318	However , in Thynne , a distinction was drawn between discretionary life prisoners and mandatory life prisoners . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	319	The Strasbourg decision in Thynne did not affect mandatory life prisoners : the Secretary of State 's discretion as to their release is preserved by section 35 of the Act of 1991 , as is his discretion whether or not to refer the case to the Parole Board . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	320	Since , under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 , it is mandatory to sentence a child murderer to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure , the effect of section 43 of the Act of 1991 is to preserve the Secretary of State 's discretions in relation to a child detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	321	It follows that it is within the Secretary of State 's discretion whether or not to release both mandatory life prisoners and children detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	322	The statement to Parliament made by Mr. Howard , the Secretary of State , on 27 July 1993 made it clear that the tariff principle first enunciated publicly by Mr. Leon Brittan in 1983 would continue to apply to adults sentenced to mandatory life imprisonment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	323	The tariff period -LRB- being the minimum period necessary to reflect the elements of retribution and deterrence -RRB- would be fixed by the Secretary of State at the beginning of the sentence after receiving judicial advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	324	The Secretary of State would then fix the date for the first review -LRB- i.e. the first reference of the matter to the Parole Board -RRB- , as being a date three years before the expiry of the tariff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	325	The statement emphasised that the tariff was only being fixed as an initial view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	326	The Secretary of State said : `` It therefore remains possible for me , or a future Secretary of State , exceptionally to revise that view of the minimum period , either by reducing it , or by increasing it where I , or a successor in my office , concludes that , putting aside questions of risk , the minimum requirements of retribution and deterrence will not have been satisfied at the expiry of the period which had previously been determined . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	327	The statement further emphasised that the Secretary of State endorsed the statement of policy made on 16 July 1991 by Dame Angela Rumbold : `` In a discretionary case , the decision on release is based purely on whether the offender continues to be a risk to the public . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	328	The presumption is that once the period that is appropriate to punishment is passed , the prisoner should be released if it is safe to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	329	The nature of the mandatory sentence is different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	330	The element of risk is not the decisive factor in handing down a life sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	331	According to the judicial process , the offender has committed a crime of such gravity that he forfeits his liberty to the state for the rest of his days - - if necessary , he can be detained for life without the necessity for subsequent judicial intervention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	332	The presumption is , therefore , that the offender should remain in custody until and unless the Home Secretary concludes that the public interest would be better served by the prisoner 's release than by his continued detention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	333	In exercising his continued discretion in that respect , the Home Secretary must take account , not just of the question of risk , but of how society as a whole would view the prisoner 's release at that juncture . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	334	The Home Secretary take -LSB- s -RSB- account of the judicial recommendation , but the final decision is his . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	335	Up to this point , the Home Secretary 's 1993 statement had been dealing with the release of adults sentenced to mandatory life imprisonment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	336	However , at the end of this statement the Home Secretary said this : `` Everything that I have said about the practice of the Secretary of State in relation to mandatory life sentence prisoners applies equally to persons who are , or will be , detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 , as well as to persons who have been , or will be , sentenced to custody for life under section 8 of the Criminal Justice Act 1982 '' Accordingly , the tariff system , whereby the punitive and deterrent element is set by the Secretary of State soon after the date of conviction , applies in just the same way to children sentenced to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure as it applies to adult murderers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	337	-LRB- b -RRB- Flexibility There are passages in the Court of Appeal judgment which suggest that the only question in this case is whether the Secretary of State was entitled to adopt any tariff policy in dealing with children sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	338	In my judgment that is not the decisive point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	339	What is crucial is whether the particular policy adopted is , in relation to children , sufficiently flexible to permit the Secretary of State to take into account all those factors to which he ought to have regard in exercising his discretion in relation to children if he is to act lawfully . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	340	Mr. Leon Brittan 's 1983 statement contained the following paragraph : `` When a date for a first , or subsequent , formal review is set for several years ahead , the Home Office will review the case on the basis of reports of the kind now prepared for formal review , at regular , and in any event not longer than three-year , intervals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	341	Moreover , governors will be told to report at once any exceptional development requiring action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	342	These procedures will ensure that I can consider any special circumstances or exceptional progress which might justify changing the review date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	343	But except where a prisoner has committed an offence for which he has received a further custodial sentence , first formal review date will not be put back . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	344	In any event , Ministers will review every case when a life sentence prisoner has been detained for 10 years . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	345	-LRB- emphasis added -RRB- Thus under the 1983 policy statement it was clear , even in the case of adult life prisoners , that their position would be kept under tri-annual review and that the Secretary of State would consider any special circumstances `` or exceptional progress '' which might justify bringing forward the review date and hence the earlier release of the prisoner , i.e. the facts relating to the prisoner 's behaviour after the commission of the offence could be taken into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	346	It was the presence of this flexibility which proved decisive in In re Findlay -LSB- 1985 -RSB- A.C. 318 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	347	Policy in this regard seems to have changed since 1983 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	348	The passage from the Secretary of State 's statement in 1993 which I have quoted refers to `` exceptionally '' revising the tariff period by `` reducing it . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	349	However , it was made clear to your Lordships both from the evidence and in submissions that in making any change to the tariff period the Secretary of State would only have regard to matters relevant to the circumstances of the commission of the crime or the applicant 's state of mind when the offence was committed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	350	The Secretary of State would not in any circumstances vary the tariff period by reason of events occurring after the commission of the crime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	351	Therefore , under the policy applied by the Secretary of State to these applicants , the way in which they mature hereafter or behave is irrelevant : however they develop , the tariff period will remain fixed at a minimum of 15 years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	352	The consequences of the Secretary of State 's decisions The position of these applicants is therefore as follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	353	Although they were only 10 1/2 years old at the date of the crime , until they have reached the age of 21 or 22 the Parole Board will not have an opportunity to consider their progress in detention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	354	During that period they will have passed through puberty , adolescence and young manhood . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

87	361	In the case of children , Parliament has directed that attention should be given not only to the requirements of punishment and protection of the public from risk but also to the welfare of the child offender . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	362	What was , in my view , tacit in the Act of 1908 was made explicit by section 44 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 which provides : `` Every court in dealing with a child or young person who is brought before it , either as an offender or otherwise , shall have regard to the welfare of the child or young person '' That subsection is still in force and is one of the basic principles applicable to dealing with child offenders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	363	It is clear from the statutory direction that in dealing with children -LRB- whether by sentencing or otherwise -RRB- a court is bound to take into account the welfare of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	364	Mr. Pannick , for the Secretary of State , felt unable to contend that the Secretary of State in exercising his discretion in relation to child offenders was not under the same duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	365	The relevant question In these circumstances , the first question to be determined is whether the Secretary of State , by adopting a policy -LRB- not laid down by Parliament -RRB- which precludes both himself and the Parole Board from having any regard to the circumstances and welfare of the applicants for a period of 12 years , has acted within the discretionary powers conferred on him in relation to children detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	366	The answer to this question depends upon the following points : -LRB- 1 -RRB- In what circumstances is it lawful to adopt a non-statutory policy in exercising a statutory discretionary power ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	367	-LRB- 2 -RRB- What are the factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion conferred on the Secretary of State in relation to children detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	368	and -LRB- 3 -RRB- Did the Act of 1991 change the nature of that discretion ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	369	I will consider these in turn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	370	Discretion and policy -- the law When Parliament confers a discretionary power exercisable from time to time over a period , such power must be exercised on each occasion in the light of the circumstances at that time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	371	In consequence , the person on whom the power is conferred can not fetter the future exercise of his discretion by committing himself now as to the way in which he will exercise his power in the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	372	He can not exercise the power nunc pro tunc . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	373	By the same token , the person on whom the power has been conferred can not fetter the way he will use that power by ruling out of consideration on the future exercise of that power factors which may then be relevant to such exercise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	374	These considerations do not preclude the person on whom the power is conferred from developing and applying a policy as to the approach which he will adopt in the generality of cases : see Rex v. Port of London Authority , Ex parte Kynoch Ltd. -LSB- 1919 -RSB- 1 K.B. 176 ; British Oxygen Company Ltd. v. Board of Trade -LSB- 1971 -RSB- A.C. 610 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	375	But the position is different if the policy adopted is such as to preclude the person on whom the power is conferred from departing from the policy or from taking into account circumstances which are relevant to the particular case in relation to which the discretion is being exercised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	376	If such an inflexible and invariable policy is adopted , both the policy and the decisions taken pursuant to it will be unlawful : see generally de Smith , Woolf and Jowell : Judicial Review of Administrative Action , 5th ed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

87	379	The position is well illustrated by your Lordships ' decision in In re Findlay -LRB- supra -RRB- which was itself concerned with the legality of the tariff policy announced in 1983 by Mr. Leon Brittan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	380	Your Lordships held that the policy was lawful because it provided for a departure from the policy in exceptional circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	381	Lord Scarman said , at p. 336G : `` The question , therefore , is simply : did the new policy constitute a refusal to consider the cases of prisoners within the specified classes ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	382	The answer is clearly ` no ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	383	Consideration of a case is not excluded by a policy which provides that exceptional circumstances or compelling reasons must be shown because of the weight to be attached to the nature of the offence , the length of the sentence and the factors of deterrence , retribution , public confidence , all of which it was the duty of the Secretary of State to consider . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	384	I see nothing wrong in classifying offenders according to the character and gravity of their offences and to the length of sentences imposed provided always that the classification does not preclude consideration of other relevant factors such as prison record , personal or family circumstances and the element of risk -LRB- or its absence -RRB- in the event of early release . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	385	In my judgment this passage demonstrates that what saved Mr. Brittan 's 1983 policy from being unlawful was that it contained within it the flexibility , in exceptional circumstances , to have regard to relevant circumstances and such circumstances included not only those factors relevant to the culpability of the offence but also `` other relevant factors such as prison record , person or family circumstances . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	386	It is not necessary in this case to consider how far the 1993 policy -LRB- which precludes consideration of matters occurring after the date of the offence such as prison record and personal circumstances -RRB- is lawful in relation to adult life prisoners . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	387	In this appeal , your Lordships are only concerned with the lawfulness of the policy as applied to children sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	388	In relation to such children , the question is whether it is lawful to adopt a policy which , even in exceptional circumstances , treats as irrelevant the progress and development of the child who has been detained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	389	This is plainly the effect of the inflexible 1993 policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	390	The answer to that question must depend upon the character of a sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	391	If such a sentence requires the Secretary of State to have regard not only to those factors relevant in considering an adult life prisoner -LRB- retribution , deterrence and risk -RRB- but also to the progress and development of the child whilst detained , it seems to me clear that the policy is unlawful since it excludes from consideration , even in exceptional circumstances , a factor relevant to the decision whether or not to release the child .

87	393	The mandatory sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure is imposed by section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 which , as currently in force , provides as follows : `` A person convicted of an offence who appears to the court to have been under the age of 18 years at the time the offence was committed shall not , if he is convicted of murder , be sentenced to imprisonment for life , nor shall sentence of death be pronounced on or recorded against any such person ; but in lieu thereof the court shall -LRB- notwithstanding anything in this or any other Act -RRB- sentence him to be detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure , and if so sentenced he shall be liable to be detained in such place and under such conditions as the Secretary of State may direct . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	394	In the Court of Appeal , Hobhouse L.J. -LRB- at p. 102G -RRB- concluded that the sentence under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- was a life sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	395	This view was not supported by Mr. Pannick in argument before your Lordships and , as the Master of the Rolls points out , at p. 82 , is inconsistent with the express words of the section : the section states in terms that the child shall not be sentenced to imprisonment for life and provides that detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure is to be `` in lieu of '' such imprisonment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	396	The words of the section itself make it clear that detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure is wholly indeterminate in duration : it lasts so long as Her Majesty -LRB- i.e. the Secretary of State -RRB- considers appropriate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	397	Therefore , in relation to a person sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure the Secretary of State is not dealing with a sentence of the same kind as the mandatory life sentence imposed on an adult murderer , the duration of which is determined by the sentence of the court and is for life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	398	In cases of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure the duty of the Secretary of State is to decide how long that detention is to last , not to determine whether or not to release prematurely a person on whom the sentence of the court is life imprisonment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	399	This factor by itself suggests that there are risks in adopting the same policy in relation to two different categories of offenders who are subject to two different sentences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	400	Why did Parliament in 1908 introduce for child murderers a mandatory sentence of indefinite duration instead of a sentence of detention for life ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	401	Lord Steyn and Lord Hope of Craighead have set out the history of the legislation which shows that since 1908 Parliament has adopted a different policy towards child offenders from that adopted towards adults . 	lord browne-wilkinson	lord steyn	partagr	0.3	NAN
87	401	Lord Steyn and Lord Hope of Craighead have set out the history of the legislation which shows that since 1908 Parliament has adopted a different policy towards child offenders from that adopted towards adults . 	lord browne-wilkinson	lord hope	partagr	0.3	NAN
87	402	In particular , in the case of child offenders the courts have to have regard not only to retribution , deterrence and prevention of risk but also to the welfare of the child offender himself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	403	This has been made demonstrably clear since 1933 by section 44 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 which I have already quoted and which Mr. Pannick accepts must also guide the Secretary of State in the exercise of his discretion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	404	That subsection is still part of the law of England : it can not just be ignored . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	405	It provides that in dealing with a child or young person the court shall have regard to the welfare of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	406	In the face of that clear statutory provision it seems to me inescapable that , in adopting a sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure , the legislature have in mind a flexible approach to child murderers which , whilst requiring regard to be had to punishment , deterrence and risk , adds an additional factor which has to be taken into account , the welfare of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	407	This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the United Kingdom -LRB- together with 186 other countries -RRB- is a party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child -LRB- 1989 -RRB- , which was drawn to our attention in a helpful brief lodged by Justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	408	The Convention provides , inter alia : `` Article 3 -LRB- i -RRB- In all actions concerning children , whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions , courts of law , administrative authorities or legislative bodies , the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	409	Article 40 -LRB- i -RRB- States parties recognise the right of every child alleged as , accused of , or recognised as having infringed the penal law to be treated in a manner consistent with the promotion of the child 's sense of dignity and worth , which reinforces the child 's respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of others and which takes into account the child 's age and the desirability of promoting the child 's reintegration and the child 's assuming a constructive role in society . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	410	The Convention has not been incorporated into English law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	411	But it is legitimate in considering the nature of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure -LRB- as to which your Lordships are not in agreement -RRB- to assume that Parliament has not maintained on the statute book a power capable of being exercised in a manner inconsistent with the treaty obligations of this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	412	Article 3 -LRB- i -RRB- requires that in the exercise of administrative , as well as court , powers the best interests of the child are a `` primary consideration . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	413	Article 40 -LRB- i -RRB- shows that the child offender is to be treated in a manner which takes into account `` the desirability of promoting the child 's reintegration and the child 's assuming a constructive role in society . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	414	The Secretary of State contends that he is entitled to fix a tariff which will endure throughout the childhood of the offender and that neither in fixing that tariff nor in considering any revision of it will he have any regard to the welfare of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	415	Such a policy would infringe the treaty obligations of this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	416	Therefore the Secretary of State in exercising his discretion as to the duration of the detention of the child must at all times be free to take into account as one of the relevant factors the welfare of the child and the desirability of reintegrating the child into society . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	417	The extent to which this is possible must depend , in the case of a young child at least , on the way in which that child is maturing through his formative years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	418	If the child is making exceptional progress and it is clear that his welfare would be improved by release from detention , that is one of the factors the Secretary of State must take into account and balance against the other relevant factors of retribution , deterrence and risk . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	419	The child 's welfare is not paramount : but it is one of the factors which must be taken into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
87	420	It follows that , unless the position has been altered by the Act of 1991 , the tariff policy adopted by the Secretary of State in 1993 is an unlawful policy in relation to child murderers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	421	First , it expressly applies to children the approach of Dame Angela Rumbold that under the sentence of the court `` he forfeits his liberty to the State for the rest of his days . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	422	The child murderer sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure does no such thing : under the sentence of the court , he forfeits his liberty only so long as , taking all relevant matters into account , the State determines to detain him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	423	Second , by applying the adult murder policy -LRB- in relation to which the welfare of the adult murderer is not a relevant factor -RRB- to the child murderer -LRB- in relation to whom the welfare of the child murderer is a relevant factor -RRB- the adoption of the policy in relation to child murderers is unlawful : it requires a relevant factor to be left out of account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	424	Third , and most important , the policy precludes any regard being had to how the child has progressed and matured during his detention until the tariff originally fixed has expired . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	425	It therefore precludes the Home Secretary during that period from giving weight to the circumstances directly relevant to an assessment of the child 's welfare . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	426	I am not suggesting that if , for other good reasons , the Home Secretary thinks it desirable to adopt some form of tariff policy in relation to the child detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure he can not do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	427	If he considers that it is advantageous to set a provisional tariff , I can see no reason why he should not do so , provided that the policy is sufficiently flexible to enable him to reconsider the position from time to time in the light of the development and progress of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	428	The Act of 1991 Part II of the Act deals with `` early release of prisoners . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	429	So far as life prisoners are concerned , they are divided into two categories , discretionary life prisoners and mandatory life prisoners . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	430	The release of a discretionary life prisoner is `` judicialised '' by section 34 : the trial judge fixes `` a part of his sentence specified in the order '' -LRB- the tariff -RRB- ; after the tariff has expired , the Secretary of State is bound , if so requested , to refer the case to the Parole Board and if they recommend release to release the prisoner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	431	By section 43 -LRB- 2 -RRB- this judicialised regime is applied to those sentenced under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 to detention for life -LRB- as opposed to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure -RRB- since such sentence is discretionary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	432	Adult murderers under a mandatory life sentence are left under a regime very similar to that which was applicable before 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	433	Under section 35 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1991 the Secretary of State , after consultation , has an absolute discretion whether or not to release on licence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	434	This non-judicialised system is also applied to child murderers subject to the mandatory sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure : section 43 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	435	An adult murderer serving a mandatory life sentence and a child murderer detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure are both subjected to the same procedural regime for release . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	436	Under section 37 , the licence for release -LRB- unless revoked -RRB- remains in force until death but the licence can be revoked under section 39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	437	It is first argued that since Part II of the Act of 1991 confers the same powers and consequences of release to children detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure as to adult mandatory life prisoners , the ambit of the powers of the Secretary of State to release both classes of prisoner must be the same . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	438	Since it is lawful for the Secretary of State to apply the 1993 tariff policy to adult murderers , it must be equally lawful to apply the same policy to children detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	439	I do not accept this argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	440	The decision of the European Court on Human Rights in Thynne -LRB- supra -RRB- drew a distinction between discretionary life prisoners and mandatory life prisoners . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	441	As to discretionary life prisoners , the court held that the system for release had to be subject to judicial control in order to satisfy the requirement of Article 5 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the European Convention on Human Rights that a person deprived of his liberty must have access to `` a court '' to determine the lawfulness of his detention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	442	However , the Strasbourg court treated those subject to mandatory sentences as being in a different position : since detention for life was the sentence prescribed by law and imposed by a court there was no need to have further court intervention in order to satisfy the requirements of Article 5 -LRB- 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	443	This same distinction was subsequently adhered to by the Strasbourg court in Wynne v. United Kingdom -LRB- 1994 -RRB- 19 E.H.R.R. 333 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	444	It is common ground that the different regimes applicable to discretionary and mandatory life prisoners were introduced by the Act of 1991 so as to comply with the decision in Thynne . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	445	Although the Strasbourg court had not at that stage considered the position of children detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure , the Act of 1991 groups them with mandatory life prisoners since in both cases their sentences are mandatory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	446	Against this background , I am unable to accept that Parliament by making the same release provisions applicable to both mandatory life prisoners and those subject to mandatory sentence during Her Majesty 's pleasure intended to effect any change in the nature of the sentences themselves . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	447	The Act of 1991 was not dealing with sentences at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	448	Any intention to alter the indeterminate duration of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure would surely have been spelt out much more clearly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	449	The mere fact that the powers relating to the release of both categories of mandatory sentence are contained in the same statutory provisions does not mean that the same considerations have to be taken into account in exercising those powers , irrespective of the nature of the sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	450	A more formidable argument was founded on the fact that , in relation to a discretionary sentence to detention for life under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 , the tariff period has to be fixed by the judge at trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	451	A tariff so fixed can not be varied subsequently by the judge so as to take account of the child 's progress in detention nor can the child be released by the Secretary of State having regard to his progress until the judicially fixed tariff has expired . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	452	Would it not be strange , it is asked , that Parliament should envisage that an unalterable tariff set at trial -LRB- and therefore by definition unable to take account of the subsequent progress of the child -RRB- should apply to a child sentenced to detention for life under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 but that the Secretary of State should be unable himself to set such an unalterable tariff in relation to those detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	453	There is here an anomaly but it is not sufficient to persuade me that Parliament , by a side-wind , meant to change the nature of the sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure into one where the development of a child can be ignored during the tariff period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	454	To effect such a change would have represented a major policy shift not in any way foreshadowed by the White Paper which preceded the passing of the Act of 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	455	Nor do I think that the anomaly is as great as it seems at first sight . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	456	In setting the judicialised tariff period under section 34 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1991 , the judge is directed to specify such a period as is `` appropriate '' taking into account the seriousness of the offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	457	The section does not say that that is the only matter to be taken into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	458	No doubt the judge , in fixing the period , will also take into account all other normal sentencing considerations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	459	In relation to a child sentenced to detention for life the judge is bound by section 44 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 -LRB- which was not repealed or altered in any way by the Act of 1991 -RRB- to have regard to the welfare of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	460	Therefore , in imposing such a tariff he must take into account the need for flexibility in the treatment of the child and , in so doing , will set the minimum tariff so as to ensure that at the earliest possible moment the matter comes under consideration of the Parole Board who will be able to balance the relevant factors including the development and progress of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	461	In my view , therefore , the Act of 1991 did not affect the nature of the sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure or the factors which are relevant to be taken into account by the Secretary of State in exercising his discretion as to the duration of the sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	462	Conclusion For these reasons , I reach the conclusion that in setting the tariff of 15 years for these two applicants the Secretary of State was applying an unlawful policy and his decisions should be quashed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	463	The unlawfulness lies in adopting a policy which totally excludes from consideration during the tariff period factors -LRB- i.e. their progress and development -RRB- necessary to determine whether release from detention would be in the interests of the welfare of the applicants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	464	Such welfare is one of the factors which the Secretary of State has to take into account in deciding from time to time how long the applicant should be detained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	465	This does not mean that in relation to children detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure any policy based on a tariff would be unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	466	But any such tariff policy would have to be sufficiently flexible to enable the Secretary of State to take into account the progress of the child and his development . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	467	In relation to children , the factors of retribution , deterrence and risk are not the only relevant factors : the welfare of the child is also another relevant factor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	468	Other points A number of other points were argued before your Lordships . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	469	In view of the decision which I have reached , it is only necessary for me to express a concluded view on one of those points . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	470	It will be clear from what I have said that I reject the submission that there is no punitive element at all involved in the sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	471	On this point I gratefully adopt the reasoning of Lord Goff of Chieveley . 	lord browne-wilkinson	lord goff	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	472	Finally , I would add a word on the issue whether it was procedurally improper for the Secretary of State to take into account the petitions and other material sent to him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	473	The Court of Appeal and , I understand , the majority of your Lordships take the view that this was improper . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	474	I find it unnecessary to express any final view but I would sound a word of caution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	475	Parliament has entrusted decisions relating to the future of these applicants to the executive , not to the judiciary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	476	Whilst it is right for the courts to ensure that in making his decision the Secretary of State acts in accordance with natural justice , in my view the court should be careful not to impose judicial procedures and attitudes on what Parliament has decided should be an executive function . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	477	I understand it to be common ground that the Secretary of State , in setting the tariff , is entitled to have regard to `` broader considerations of a public character '' including public respect for the administration of justice and public attitudes to criminal sentencing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	478	How is the Secretary of State to discover what those attitudes are except from the media and from petitions ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	479	To seek to differentiate between the Secretary of State discovering public feeling generally -LRB- which is proper -RRB- and taking into account distasteful public reactions in a particular case -LRB- which is said to be unlawful -RRB- seems to me too narrow a distinction to be workable in practice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	480	Public attitudes are ill-defined and are usually only expressed in relation to particular cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	481	I would , therefore , allow the cross-appeals and make no order on the appeal . 	lord browne-wilkinson	self	outcome	0.4	NAN

87	484	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	485	Introduction A child below the age of 10 can not be guilty of any offence in English law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	486	A child between the age of 10 and 14 can only be guilty of an offence if it is proved by the prosecution , as it was in these cases , that he knew that what he was doing was `` seriously wrong . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	487	The punishment of those between the ages of 10 and 17 is governed by section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	488	Under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- a child or young person who is convicted of murder is sentenced to be detained `` during Her Majesty 's pleasure in such place and under such conditions as the Secretary of State may direct . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	489	The sentence is mandatory , just as it is in the case of an adult convicted of murder . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	490	Section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- covers other grave crimes , which would , in the case of an adult , carry a sentence of 14 years ' or more imprisonment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	491	In such a case the court may pass a determinate sentence of detention , not exceeding the maximum sentence of imprisonment for an adult , or it may pass an indeterminate sentence , that is to say a sentence of detention for life : see Reg . v. Abbott -LSB- 1964 -RSB- 1 Q.B. 489 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	492	Unlike the sentence of detention under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- the sentence of detention for life under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- is discretionary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	493	The release of life sentence prisoners convicted of murder lies in the discretion of the Home Secretary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	494	On 30 November 1983 the then Home Secretary , Mr. Leon Brittan , announced a new policy covering the release of life sentence prisoners convicted of murdering police officers , and certain other categories of offender , including those guilty of the sexual or sadistic murder of children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	495	Such offenders could expect to serve at least 20 years in prison . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	496	The effect of the new policy was to separate consideration of the punitive element in the sentence , that is to say , the period of imprisonment required for retribution and deterrence , from the consideration of risk to the public . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	497	For the former he would continue to ask the judiciary for advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	498	For the latter he would look to the Parole Board . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	499	The Home Secretary would himself decide when to refer the case to the Parole Board . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	500	This would usually be three years before the expiry of the punitive element in the sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	501	In the meantime the Home Office would review each case at three-yearly intervals on the basis of reports of the kind prepared for formal reviews . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	502	Nothing was said in the policy statement about juvenile offenders sentenced under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Children and Young Persons Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	503	Judgments - Reg . v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte V. and Reg . v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte T. continued It was not long before Mr. Leon Brittan 's new policy was challenged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	504	In In re Findlay -LSB- 1985 -RSB- A.C. 318 , it was argued that the new policy was unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	505	The classification of offences by reference to their gravity was said to be inconsistent with each case being considered individually on its merits . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	506	The gravity of the offence was only one factor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	507	It should not be considered to the exclusion of other relevant factors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	508	This was the argument which was accepted by Browne-Wilkinson L.J. in his dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	509	In the House , Lord Scarman said at p. 335 that he had difficulty in understanding how a Secretary of State could properly manage the complexities of his statutory duty without a policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	510	After referring to an observation of Templeman L.J. in Attorney-General ex rel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	511	Tilley v. Wandsworth London Borough Council -LSB- 1981 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 854 , he continued : `` But the duty of the Secretary of State in this case is , as I have already shown , a very complex one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	512	Indeed , the complexities are such that an approach based on a carefully formulated policy could be said to be called for . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	513	There is , as I understand the law nothing to prevent such an approach , where it is appropriate . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	514	So there was no objection to the Home Secretary adopting a policy in guiding the exercise of his discretion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	515	On 23 July 1987 Mr. Douglas Hurd made a further statement in the light of the decision of the Divisional Court in Reg . v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte Handscomb -LRB- 1987 -RRB- 86 Cr.App.R . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	516	59 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	517	He announced that the first formal review by the Home Office would take place as soon as practical after conviction , instead of being postponed for three or four years as had been the practice hitherto . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	518	The Home Secretary would then determine the date for the first formal review by the Parole Board , which would normally be three years before the earliest release date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	519	Mr. Hurd made clear that in setting the first review date he would take account not only of the requirement of retribution and deterrence , but also , among other factors , the need to maintain public confidence in the criminal justice system . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	520	`` I shall ensure that the timing of the first formal review in such cases is fixed in accordance with my overall policy for ensuring that the time served by prisoners serving sentences for the worst offences of violence fully reflects public concern about violent crime . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	521	Then in 1990 came the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Thynne , Wilson and Gunnell v. United Kingdom , 13 E.H.R.R. 666 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	522	That decision is not of direct relevance , since it was concerned with adults serving discretionary life sentence after the punitive period of their imprisonment had expired . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	523	The court held that their continued detention was in violation of Article 5 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the European Convention on Human Rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	524	Accordingly it became necessary for the Government to legislate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	525	Part II of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 is headed `` Early Release of Prisoners . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	526	It is based on the recommendations of the Committee chaired by Lord Carlisle of Bucklow Q.C. in their review of the parole system -LRB- `` The Parole System in England and Wales '' -LRB- 1988 -RRB- -LRB- Cm . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	527	532 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	528	Section 34 was the Government 's specific response to the decision of the European Court in the Thynne case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	529	It imposes a duty on the Secretary of State to release a discretionary life prisoner once he has served that part of his sentence which is set by the court as `` the tariff '' for retribution and deterrence , and once the Parole Board has directed his release . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	530	In the case of discretionary life prisoners the Secretary of State no longer has any discretion as to the release date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	531	Section 35 is different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	532	It covers long-term and life prisoners , other than those serving a discretionary life sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	533	Sub-section -LRB- 2 -RRB- confers on the Secretary of State the power to release a prisoner serving a mandatory life sentence , if recommended to do so by the Parole Board , but only after consultation with the judiciary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	534	Sub-section -LRB- 3 -RRB- prohibits the Board from making a recommendation for release unless the Secretary of State has first referred the case to the Board . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	535	There is nothing in section 35 which requires the Secretary of State to refer the case to the Board at any particular time or at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	536	It is left to the discretion of the Secretary of State . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	537	Section 43 concerns young offenders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	538	Section 43 -LRB- 1 -RRB- covers those serving determinate sentences of detention under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	539	It provides that Part II of the Act of 1991 shall apply to such persons as if they were serving an equivalent sentence of imprisonment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
87	540	Section 43 -LRB- 2 -RRB- covers those serving indeterminate sentences of detention under section 53 , that is to say , those who are detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 , and those detained for life under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	541	It provides that Part II of the Act of 1991 shall apply to such persons as if they were serving sentences of imprisonment for life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	542	Finally , section 51 -LRB- 1 -RRB- provides that `` life prisoner '' in Part II means a life prisoner as defined in section 34 -LRB- 7 -RRB- , , but extended to include those covered by section 43 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	543	It is on the interaction of section 35 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and section 43 -LRB- 2 -RRB- that the outcome of the main issue in this appeal depends . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	544	But it is first necessary to complete the background material , by referring to the next occasion on which the Home Secretary 's procedures for releasing life prisoners was challenged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	545	This came with the decision of the House in Reg . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	546	v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte Doody -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 A.C. 531 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	547	It was held in that case that the Secretary of State must afford a person found guilty of murder an opportunity to make effective representations as to the date of his first referral to the Parole Board , and hence , by adding three years , his earliest date of release . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	548	The offender must be informed of the tariff recommended by the judges , and the gist of their advice to the Home Secretary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	549	I return to these points later . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	550	At this stage I wish only to draw attention to what Lord Mustill had to say as to a further argument advanced by the applicants in that case , namely , that the Home Secretary acted unlawfully by setting a tariff period in excess of that recommended by the judiciary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	551	It was submitted that the judges were uniquely skilled and experienced in matching punishment to the needs of retribution and deterrence , and that the Secretary of State should not interfere . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	552	This argument was roundly rejected by the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	553	Lord Mustill said , at p. 559 : `` The Secretary of State is compelled , or at least entitled , to have regard to broader considerations of a public character than those which apply to an ordinary sentencing function . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	554	It is he , and not the judges , who is entrusted with the task of deciding upon the prisoner 's release , and it is he who has decided , within the general powers conferred upon him by the statute , to divide his task into two stages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	555	It is not , and could not be , suggested that he acted unlawfully in this respect and I can see no ground whatever for suggesting that by doing so he deprived himself entirely of his discretion at the first stage , and delivered it into the hands of the judges . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	556	If the decision in Ex parte Handscomb is to a contrary effect , then with due respect to a very experienced court , I must disagree . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	557	Within a month of the decision of the House in Ex parte Doody , the Secretary of State , Mr. Michael Howard , made a further policy statement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	558	He announced that he would give effect to the judgment of the House in Doody by arranging for those convicted of murder to be informed of the substance -LRB- `` gist '' -RRB- of the judicial recommendations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	559	He continued : `` I take this opportunity to emphasise that the view which I or a minister acting under my authority takes , at the beginning of a mandatory life sentence , of the period necessary to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence is an initial view of the minimum period necessary to satisfy those requirements . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	560	It therefore remains possible for me , or a future Secretary of State , exceptionally to revise that view of the minimum period , either by reducing it , or by increasing it where I , or a successor in my office , concludes that , putting aside questions of risk , the minimum requirements of retribution and deterrence will not have been satisfied at the expiry of the period which had previously been determined . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	561	He went on to outline the factors which he would take into account before releasing a convicted murderer : `` I will consider not only -LRB- a -RRB- whether the period served by the prisoner is adequate to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence and -LRB- b -RRB- whether it is safe to release the prisoner , but also -LRB- c -RRB- the public acceptability of early release . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	562	This means that I will exercise my discretion to release only if I am satisfied that to do so will not threaten the maintenance of public confidence in the system of criminal justice . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	563	Finally , he said that the practice which he had described would apply equally to persons detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 , as well as to persons sentenced to custody for life under section 8 of the Criminal Justice Act 1982 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	564	This was the first time that the practice in relation to juvenile offenders had been mentioned in a policy statement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	565	But it was not suggested that the 1993 statement marked any change in the Home Secretary 's previous practice in setting a tariff for juvenile offenders convicted of murder . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	566	With that rather lengthy introduction I can now turn to the issues in the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	567	The substantive issue The first question is whether the Home Secretary is entitled to have a policy at all with regard to juvenile offenders convicted of murder , whereby he determines in advance a minimum period which the offender must serve before he is considered for release . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	568	The second question is whether he is entitled to have the same policy as he has in the case of adult murderers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	569	As to the first question , all three judges of the Court of Appeal answered in the affirmative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	570	I do not see how any other answer is possible , bearing in mind the width of the discretion conferred on the Secretary of State , the age range of those under consideration , namely , 10 to 21 , and the number of those convicted of murder within that age-range . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	571	Thus Lord Woolf M.R. -LRB- who in the event was in a minority on the substantive issues -RRB- said at p. 38 : `` Again the fact that the mandatory sentence of detention for young offenders has the distinction from the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment which I have described does not mean that the same tariff-based approach can not be deployed in relation to both . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	572	The distinction between the sentences can be accommodated in the application of the policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	573	This involves paying greater attention to the need for flexibility when circumstances require . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	574	A little later he said : `` The Home Secretary 's discretion as to release is very wide . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	575	It is the type of discretion which calls out for the development of policy as to the way it will in general be exercised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	576	This should assist in providing consistency and certainty which are highly desirable in an area involving the administration of justice where fairness is particularly important . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	577	As to informing the young offender of the minimum period to be served , views might differ . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	578	Lord Woolf M.R. had this to say : `` The objection which is most often made by those subject to an indeterminate sentence is its uncertainty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	579	They need a target date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	580	It is also sensible from the administrator 's point of view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	581	It avoids conducting reviews which will serve no purpose at times when there is no question of the offender being released from custody which will only give rise to unjustified expectations on the part of the detainee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	582	In addition it identifies the penal element which perfectly properly the young offender can normally be expected to serve by way of punishment . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	583	These are wise words with which I wholly agree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	584	But it is worth repeating -LRB- it can not be said too often -RRB- that the question is not whether the policy is wise or unwise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	585	The question is whether it is lawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	586	I need not quote from the majority judgments on this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	587	They both affirm the lawfulness of the Home Secretary 's policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	588	I have some difficulty in understanding the judgment of the Divisional Court , given by Pill L.J. Having pointed out that the sentence on a young offender should be kept under regular review , the Divisional Court continued : `` That requirement does not prevent the Secretary of State forming an initial and provisional view as to what punishment and deterrence requires . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	589	That may well be helpful to him in performing his later duties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	590	He can take judicial advice before forming that view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	591	What I can not accept is that in the case of an offender aged 10 or 11 he can fix a tariff of 15 years as if the offender were an adult . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	592	This seems to be saying that it is not the policy that is wrong , but the length of the tariff in this particular case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	593	This is borne out by other passages in the Divisional Court 's judgment as follows : `` It is inconsistent with the requirement to keep under review to fix a 15-year tariff at the beginning of a sentence on a child of 11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	594	The need to keep an open mind , and to keep the whole question under review , is stronger as the age of the offender at time of sentence is younger . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	595	In the case of an offender aged 16 or 17 , it will usually be possible to express a firmer initial view than in the present case . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	596	It is true that the Divisional Court went on to say that they were not expressing any view as to the merits of the sentence by way of length , but only as to the lack of merit in fixing it so early . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	597	But I find this difficult to reconcile with what follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	598	The Divisional Court record , and appear to accept , Mr. Fitzgerald 's concession that the tariff figure of 8 years recommended by the trial judge would have accorded with `` the underlying purpose of the sentence . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	599	It would not have been unlawful , since it would have allowed for a review after five years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	600	This seems to be an acceptance by the Divisional Court that it is lawful to fix the tariff at the beginning of the sentence , even in the case of a ten-year old child , provided the tariff is not too long . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	601	So I am driven to the conclusion that in the eyes of the Divisional Court the real objection to the fifteen-year tariff was not the fixing of the tariff at the beginning of the sentence , but the length of the tariff in the case of these two children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	602	If a tariff of eight years would have been consistent with `` keeping an open mind '' and `` keeping the whole question under review '' , why not a tariff of fifteen years ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	603	I now turn to the argument on behalf of the two applicants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	604	The starting-point was that the sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure is preventive and therapeutic by nature , and contains no punitive element . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	605	The Divisional Court rejected this proposition ; so did all the members of the Court of Appeal , and so would I. Section 53 of the Act of 1933 is headed `` Punishment of certain grave crimes . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	606	Section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- which enables the court to impose a determinate sentence , i.e. detention for a period of years , is clearly punitive in character , or at least contains a punitive element . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	607	In Reg . v. Fairhurst -LSB- 1986 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 1374 , a case which concerned a number of appellants who had been sentenced to various periods of detention under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- for crimes such as burglarly , rape and arson , Lord Lane C.J. said , at pp. 1376-1377 : `` On the one hand there exists the desirability of keeping youths under the age of 17 out of long terms of custody . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	608	This is implicit in the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1982 already referred to . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	609	On the other hand it is necessary that serious offences committed by youths of this age should be met with sentences sufficiently substantial to provide both the appropriate punishment and also the necessary deterrent effect , and in certain cases to provide a measure of protection to the public . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	610	A balance has to be struck between these objectives . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	611	If a sentence under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- is punitive in character , or contains a punitive element , as it obviously does , it would be preposterous if the sentence for the gravest crime of all under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- did not contain a punitive element . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	612	It was conceded by Mr. Higgs that this must be so in the case of a young person of 17 convicted of murder , but he submitted that the position was different for a child of 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	613	But the wording of section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- is the same in both cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	614	If a sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure is capable of containing a punitive element in the case of a murderer aged 17 , it must also be capable , as a matter of language , of including a punitive element in the case of a child aged 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	615	The age of the offender is , of course , highly relevant to the length of the minimum period of detention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	616	But it can not be said that at the age of 10 the sentence is purely rehabilitative or therapeutic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	617	Otherwise there would be no purpose in requiring the prosecution to prove , as they did in these cases , that the applicants knew that what they were doing was seriously wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	618	If it be right that the sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure contains a punitive element , then the rest seems to follow . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	619	The Home Secretary was entitled to set a policy which covers the imposition of a sentence on those within the age group 10 to 17 , just as he can have a policy for those in the age group 18 to 21 sentenced to custody for life , and for those serving an adult sentence of life imprisonment , provided always he considers each case on its own merits . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	620	No doubt opinions will differ greatly as to the length of the appropriate tariff in a given case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	621	But as to that , the only opinion which matters is that of the Home Secretary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	622	The decision is always one of the utmost gravity , especially so in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	623	The courts can not interfere on the ground that 15 years was too long , or even that it was half as long again as the tariff proposed by the Lord Chief Justice : see Ex parte Doody at p. 559 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	624	The only ground on which the courts could interfere would be if the sentence were beyond all reason , or irrational in the Wednesbury sense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	625	This was not suggested . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	626	If it was intended to be suggested , I would not accept the suggestion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	627	That brings me to the second question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	628	If it is lawful for the Home Secretary to have a policy at all in relation to the 10 to 17 age group , as it clearly is , is it lawful for him to have the same policy as he has in relation to adults , or -LRB- presumably -RRB- the 18 to 21 age group , although the latter comparison was hardly mentioned in the course of the hearing ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	629	It was pointed out -- correctly -- that the origin of the expression `` detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure '' lies in the sentence first imposed on criminal lunatics in the time of George III , and its adoption by Parliament in section 103 of the Children Act 1908 , from whence it found its way into section 53 of the Act of 1933 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	630	When in 1908 Parliament abolished the death sentence for children and young persons , it might have chosen life imprisonment or custody for life as the alternative punishment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	631	Instead it chose a sentence which was expressed to be indeterminate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	632	It was argued that , by announcing that he would apply the same policy in the case of children and adults , the Home Secretary obliterated this distinction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	633	The last paragraph of his 1993 policy statement was thus said to be unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	634	This was the ground on which the Divisional Court decided against the Home Secretary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	635	I return to this argument later . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	636	Judgments - Reg . v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte V. and Reg . v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte T. continued Whatever merit the argument may have had in the past , it can not possibly survive the passing of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	637	It was common ground that the relevant release power is contained in section 35 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act , which provides : `` If recommended to do so by the Board , the Secretary of State may , after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice together with the trial judge if available , release on licence a life prisoner who is not a discretionary life prisoner . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	638	In order to understand the operation of section 35 -LRB- 2 -RRB- in relation to young offenders , it is necessary to refer in greater detail to some of the other provisions of Part II of the Act of 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	639	As already mentioned , section 34 imposes a duty to release discretionary life sentence prisoners when certain conditions have been satisfied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	640	Section 33 imposes a duty to release short-term and long-term prisoners after half and two-thirds of their sentences , respectively , and section 35 -LRB- 1 -RRB- grants a power to release a long-term prisoner after one-half of his sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	641	Then comes section 43 which is the all-important section . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	642	It is necessary to set out this section in full : `` Young offenders -LRB- 1 -RRB- Subject to subsections -LRB- 4 -RRB- and -LRB- 5 -RRB- below , this Part applies to persons serving sentences of detention in a young offender institution , or determinate sentences of detention under section 53 of the 1933 Act , as it applies to persons serving equivalent sentences of imprisonment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	643	-LRB- 2 -RRB- Subject to subsection -LRB- 5 -RRB- below , this Part applies to persons serving - -LRB- a -RRB- sentences of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure or for life under section 53 of the 1933 Act ; or -LRB- b -RRB- sentences of custody for life under section 8 of the 1982 Act , as it applies to persons serving sentences of imprisonment for life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	644	-LRB- 3 -RRB- References in this Part to prisoners -LRB- whether short-term , long-term or life prisoners -RRB- , or to prison or imprisonment , shall be construed in accordance with subsections -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- above . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	645	-LRB- 4 -RRB- In relation to a short-term prisoner under the age of 18 years to whom subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- of section 33 above applies , that subsection shall have effect as if it required the Secretary of State - -LRB- a -RRB- to release him unconditionally if his sentence is for a term of twelve months or less ; and -LRB- b -RRB- to release him on licence if that sentence is for a term of more than twelve months . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	646	-LRB- 5 -RRB- In relation to a person under the age of 22 years who is released on licence under this Part , section 37 -LRB- 4 -RRB- above shall have effect as if the reference to supervision by a probation officer included a reference to supervision by a social worker of a local authority social services department . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	647	Section 43 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 3 -RRB- apply the provisions of section 33 -LRB- short-and long-term prisoners -RRB- and section 35 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- long-term prisoners -RRB- to those detained under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	648	There can not be any doubt as to that , since the provisions are applied with the modifications set out in section 43 -LRB- 4 -RRB- and -LRB- 5 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	649	Similarly , section 43 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and -LRB- 3 -RRB- apply section 35 -LRB- 2 -RRB- to two classes of offenders under the age of 22 , namely , those detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 and those sentenced to custody for life under section 8 of the Act of 1982 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	650	They also apply section 34 of the Act to those detained for life under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	651	Again there can be no doubt as to the intention , since the provisions are applied with the modifications set out in section 43 -LRB- 5 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	652	But section 35 -LRB- 2 -RRB- can only apply at all to those detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure if they are treated , for the purposes of section 35 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , as life prisoners . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	653	Hence the definition in section 51 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1991 which provides that `` life prisoner '' has the meaning given by section 34 -LRB- 7 -RRB- of the Act as extended by section 43 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	654	Against this statutory background , it hardly matters whether a sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure is correctly described as a `` life '' sentence or not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	655	Since it is assimilated to a life sentence for all purposes of release , it is certainly a sentence which covers the offender for the rest of his natural life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	656	Like an adult murderer , a juvenile murderer released on licence can be recalled at any time : see section 37 -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	657	In these circumstances , the distinction urged on your Lordships between a sentence which orders detention for life and a sentence which authorises detention for life can not be sustained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	658	In the light of section 43 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1991 it is a distinction without practical difference . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	659	It is said that an adult convicted of murder has `` forfeited '' his liberty for the rest of his life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
87	660	But this is only because , after release , he is liable to be recalled . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	661	Exactly the same applies to a juvenile detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	662	Since Parliament has created a direct link between the mandatory life sentence and sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure , and provided the same release procedure for both , I can not see how it can be said to be unlawful for the Secretary of State to apply the same policy of indicating the minimum period to be served for the purposes of retribution and deterrence as soon as practicable after the sentence has been imposed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	663	This is made all the more manifest by comparison with the discretionary life sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	664	As already mentioned , a discretionary sentence for life can be imposed , and is from time to time imposed , under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 : see Reg . v. Abbott . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	665	That would bring the case within section 34 of the Act of 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	666	The judge then sets the tariff in accordance with the 1993 Practice Direction : -LSB- 1993 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 223 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	667	If a judge can set a tariff in respect of a sentence under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , as Parliament has provided , how can it be unlawful for the Secretary of State to fix a tariff in respect of the more serious conviction under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	668	Contrary to the view of the Divisional Court , I can not accept that there was anything unlawful in the last paragraph of the Home Secretary 's 1993 policy statement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	669	On this aspect of the case I find myself in complete agreement with the views expressed by Hobhouse L.J. and Morritt L.J. I can not , with respect , agree with Lord Woolf M.R. that the Home Secretary must have been guilty of an over-rigid application of his policy , or must have misunderstood the nature of the tariff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	670	The only evidence for this conclusion is Lord Woolf 's view that 15 years would appear to be `` totally unreasonable '' in the case of a child of ten . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	671	But according to Mr. Newton 's affidavit , the Home Secretary had particular regard for the age of these offenders , and their need for rehabilitation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	672	Indeed this appears in each case from the decision letter itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	673	For if he had not had regard to their age , he would presumably have imposed a tariff of 25 years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	674	But the age of the applicants , and their need for rehabilitation , were not the only factors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	675	In addition to the punitive element in the sentence , the Home Secretary was entitled to have regard to other factors , and especially the need for maintaining public confidence in the criminal justice system : see In re Findlay , per Lord Scarman , at p. 333B and Ex parte Doody , per Lord Mustill , at p. 559B . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	676	In the light of these other factors it can not be said that the Home Secretary 's initial view of 15 years was so far beyond what was reasonable as to point inevitably to a wrong approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	677	If the figure had been 10 years -LRB- the tariff suggested by the Lord Chief Justice -RRB- or even 12 years the argument could hardly have got off the ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	678	I accept , of course , that a policy otherwise lawful may be attacked on the ground of its over-rigid application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	679	Each case must be considered on its merits before the policy is applied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	680	If , for example , the Home Secretary had announced a policy that all children found guilty of murder should be detained for at least seven years , such a policy might well have been unlawful if it did not allow for exceptions : see In re Findlay , per Lord Scarman , at p. 336G . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	681	But the Home Secretary 's decision in the present case can not be faulted on that ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	682	The minimum detention of 15 years was not fixed by reference to a predetermined scale . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	683	It was decided by reference to the facts of the case , and the circumstances of these two applicants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	684	So there was no need to allow for any exceptions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	685	If the minimum period of detention were a `` tariff '' sentence in the true sense of the word , there might be grounds for criticism . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	686	But it is not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	687	As Lord Mustill observed in Ex parte Doody at pp. 556-558 the use of the word `` tariff '' in that context is apt to be misleading . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	688	Then it is said that the policy is over-rigid because it does not allow for a reconsideration of the tariff on the ground of exceptional progress during detention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	689	This limitation is not , in fact , spelt out in the 1993 policy statement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	690	The statement expressly contemplates that the initial tariff period may be reduced or increased . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	691	The argument therefore depends on the way the policy is currently being applied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	692	According to Mr. Newton 's affidavit , the Home Secretary does not currently consider exceptional progress in detention as a ground for reconsidering the tariff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	693	Is this enough to make the policy as a whole unlawful ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	694	There is a danger here that the courts , by insisting on flexibility in every aspect of the policy , may emasculate the policy itself , and deprive it of all utility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	695	If the Home Secretary is entitled to have a policy at all in relation to young offenders by which he announces the tariff period as soon as possible after the start of the sentence -LRB- as to which I entirely agree with what Lord Woolf says -RRB- I can not for my part accept that the whole policy is undermined by the absence of a formal review during that period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	696	I say that for three reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	697	In the first place , the progress of these two applicants in detention , while not qualifying them for release until after 15 years , will certainly be monitored during that period ; no doubt exceptional progress will be an important factor in deciding how soon thereafter they may be released . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	698	Secondly , Parliament has itself provided for early release on compassionate grounds : see section 36 of the Act of 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	699	Thirdly , there is no special provision for early release on the grounds of exceptional progress where a young offender is serving a determinate sentence or a discretionary life sentence under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	700	Subject to section 43 -LRB- 4 -RRB- and -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the Act of 1991 , Parliament intended that they should be dealt with in the same way as adult offenders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	701	So why should there be any provision for early release on the grounds of exceptional progress in the case of young offenders serving the equivalent of a mandatory life sentence ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	702	For these reasons , and especially the third , I can not agree that the Home Secretary 's policy announced in 1993 is unlawful on the ground that it lacks sufficient flexibility , nor that its application in the case of these two applicants was unlawful on that ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	703	Finally , I return to the argument accepted by a majority of your Lordships that a sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure is , and has always been , different in conception from a sentence of life imprisonment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	704	The argument is that when Parliament abolished the death sentence for children and young persons in 1908 , it might have substituted a sentence of life imprisonment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	705	Instead it substituted a sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	706	It is said that the Home Secretary failed to appreciate this conceptual distinction when he announced in 1993 that he would adopt the same practice in the case of children and young persons as in the case of adult murderers , and when , in particular , he fixed the tariff for these two applicants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	707	I do not myself get much assistance from the legislative history in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	708	We know that one of the objectives of the Act of 1908 was to ensure that children and young persons did not mix with adult prisoners in ordinary jails . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	709	This is a sufficient explanation for why Parliament avoided the use of the term imprisonment , and chose instead detention `` in such place and under such conditions as the Secretary of State may direct . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	710	We do not know why Parliament chose the words `` during Her Majesty 's pleasure . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	711	If the intention had been to secure that the sentence should be purely preventative and therapeutic , as in the case of criminal lunatics , then there would indeed have been a conceptual difference . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	712	But none of your Lordships are of that view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	713	For my part I can not read anything more into the words `` during Her Majesty 's pleasure '' than that they were intended to describe a sentence which is indeterminate in length , like a life sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	714	Nor is there anying in the language of section 103 which required the sentence to be kept under continual review , any more than a determinate sentence for less serious offences under section 104 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	715	So I do not accept that a sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure was conceptually different from a life sentence in 1908 , save in relation to the place and conditions of detention ; and if there ever was such a difference , it soon became obscured . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	716	For it seems to have escaped the attention of the Departmental Committee which reported on the Treatment of Young Offenders in 1927 , Cmnd . 2831 , and the Ingleby Committee which reported in 1960 , Cmnd . 1911 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	717	It is unfortunate that Parliament continues to use archaic language in a modern statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	718	Your Lordships are all agreed that `` during Her Majesty 's pleasure '' does not mean what it meant when the phrase originated nearly 200 years ago . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	719	What it meant in 1908 must remain a matter for speculation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	720	Even if the legislative background sounded with a more certain note , I would not myself allow the history of the phrase to influence , still less control , the meaning which Parliament plainly intended in 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	721	Like my noble and learned friend , Lord Goff of Chieveley , I would dismiss the applicants ' cross-appeals . 	lord lloyd	lord goff	partagr	0.6	NAN
87	722	Procedural Issues As to the Home Secretary 's appeal , I have the misfortune to find myself again in a minority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	723	I can deal briefly with two of the three points . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	724	It is said that the Secretary of State had insufficient material on which to exercise his discretion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	725	For example , it is said that if he had been sentencing the applicants in court he would have asked for psychiatric reports as to their level of responsibility having regard to their age . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	726	At the very least he would have asked for a social inquiry report . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	727	With all respect to the judges of the Court of Appeal who expressed their views in strong terms -LRB- Lord Woolf described the Secretary of State 's approach as perfunctory -RRB- , I can not agree with this conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	728	The Secretary of State was not bereft of material . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	729	He had the judge 's report , which summarised the medical evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	730	It is worth quoting the following passage : `` Both Thompson and Venables were healthy boys of average intelligence with no mental abnormality However , these two boys came from homes and families with great social and emotional deprivation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	731	They grew up in an atmosphere of matrimonial breakdown where they were exposed to , saw , heard or suffered abuse , drunkenness and violence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	732	I have no doubt both boys saw video films frequently showing violent and aberrant activities . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	733	The Secretary of State was entitled to accept the judge 's report at its face value . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	734	He was not obliged to look for corroboration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	735	If he had been minded to disagree with the judge 's view of the mental state of the applicants , then of course he would have been obliged to seek further psychiatric advice , as Mr. Pannick accepted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	736	But he was not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	737	Moreover , if the Home Secretary were obliged to seek further reports , so also was the Lord Chief Justice , when he increased the judge 's tariff from 8 years to 10 years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	738	If the courts are going to tell the Home Secretary how to perform a function which has been entrusted to him , and to him alone , by Parliament , then there would appear to be no limit to the bounds of judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	739	Of course , the court will interfere if the Home Secretary acts unlawfully or abuses his powers , or behaves unfairly , or on any of the other well established grounds of judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	740	But there was nothing remotely unfair in the Secretary of State assessing the tariff on the information which he already had , without calling for further reports . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	741	Secondly , it is said that the Home Secretary ought to have made full disclosure of all the material on which he relied , and in particular should have disclosed the whole of the judge 's report , in order to enable the applicants to make adequate representations , and to correct any mistakes of fact . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	742	It was not enough , so it was said , that the Secretary of State should have made known the recommendations of the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice , as required by the House in Ex parte Doody ; the applicants were entitled to the full text of the judge 's report . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	743	Indeed the applicants were said to be entitled to disclosure of all the materials before the Home Secretary , including details of any comparable cases on which the Home Secretary proposed to rely , and , I suppose , any comparable cases which might assist the applicants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	744	But this goes much too far . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	745	In my opinion the appropriate limit was set in Ex parte Doody , which required no more than that the Home Secretary should disclose the gist of the judge 's advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	746	That would almost always be enough , as it was in this case , to enable the applicants to know the case against them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	747	We were informed that it is now the practice of the Home Secretary to disclose the judicial comments in full , other than material relating to future risk . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	748	This does not , of course , mean that the previous practice was unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	749	The full report was disclosed to the applicants on 23 January 1995 , when they were invited to make further representations if they wished . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	750	This was as far , and maybe further , than the Home Secretary was obliged to go . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	751	How could he sensibly disclose all the material which weighed with him when considering the need to maintain public confidence in the rule of law ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	752	I come now to the third and last point of criticism . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	753	The relevant paragraph in the decision letter dated 22 July 1994 reads as follows : `` In making his decision , the Secretary of State had regard to the circumstances of the offence , the recommendations received from the judiciary , the representations made on your behalf and the extent to which this case could be compared with other cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	754	He also had regard to the public concern about this case , which was evidenced by the petitions and other correspondence the substance of which were disclosed to your solicitors by our letter of 16 June 1994 , and to the need to maintain public confidence in the system of criminal justice . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	755	The facts are that the Home Secretary received a petition signed by 278,000 members of the public submitted by the victim 's family . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	756	The petition called for a full-life sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	757	The family also submitted some 4,400 letters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	758	Another petition was signed by 5,900 members of the public calling for a minimum of 25 years ' detention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	759	On 28 June 1994 one of the applicants ' solicitors wrote to the Home Office `` objecting most strongly to the reception of ` political ' representations made to the Secretary of State behind the back of the applicant and his family and without a proper opportunity to respond . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	760	The solicitors asked to be sent the full text of any petition , letters or representations received by the Secretary of State ; in addition they asked for all materials which would be before the Secretary of State when he reached his decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	761	On 7 July 1994 the Home Office replied that the applicant already had the full text of the petitions -LRB- other than the signatures -RRB- and that it was not practicable to make all the letters available . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	762	No further representations were received from the applicant before the Secretary of State reached his decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	763	The complaint is , first , that the Home Secretary is not entitled to have regard to public concern in relation to an individual case , and , secondly , that he was not entitled to take account of the petitions and other correspondence as evidence of public concern in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	764	I am bound to note that this complaint , however it may be put , forms no part of the grounds on which relief is sought . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	765	The original complaint related only to the failure to disclose the material . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	766	Judgments - Reg . v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte V. and Reg . v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte T. continued When the case came before the Divisional Court , Pill L.J. drew attention to the `` massive representations '' which the Home Secretary had received . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	767	He acknowledged the Secretary of State 's responsibility to maintain public confidence in the system of justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	768	`` The public can , '' he said , `` be expected to express overwhelmingly their support for Mr. and Mrs. Bulger in the tragic loss they have suffered and support measures to prevent such a crime happening again . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	769	I am confident that many more than 300,000 people would share those views . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	770	There was no suggestion at the hearing before the Divisional Court or in the judgment , that the Secretary of State had been wrong to take the petitions or the correspondence into account as evidence of public concern . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	771	It therefore comes as something of a surprise to find the point featuring so strongly in the judgments of Lord Woolf M.R. and Hobhouse L.J. in the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	772	I quote from the judgment of Hobhouse L.J. : `` But it appears that the Secretary of State was in the present case prepared to take into account a large amount of material which in effect amounted to taking a hopelessly unscientific poll from members of the public without any satisfactory checks or without any confidence as to the factual or legal basis upon which the responses were made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	773	If the Secretary of State is choosing to assume the role of deciding the period necessary for these defendants for retribution and deterrence , he should not only disregard but be seen to disregard material of this kind . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	774	It was the `` quality '' of the material , to use his own expression , which Hobhouse L.J. found so alien and , perhaps , distasteful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	775	Morritt L.J. took a different line . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	776	`` It is true that the material in this case is open to the criticisms made by the Master of the Rolls and Hobhouse L.J. . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	777	But public concern is not necessarily either logical , fully informed or free from prejudice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	778	It is the fact that the concern is public that gives it significance ; what weight , if any , to attach to it is a matter for the Secretary of State . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	779	Accordingly however alien such a consideration may be to a judge sentencing an offender it is not one which , in my view , the Secretary of State is legally precluded from taking into account . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
87	780	I find myself in agreement with Morritt L.J. . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	781	If the Home Secretary is entitled to take account of the need to maintain public confidence in the criminal justice system , as everybody agrees , I can see no reason why he should not take account of genuine public concern over a particular case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	782	If he were to ignore such genuine concern -LRB- and nobody has suggested that the petitions and the correspondence were not genuine -RRB- it would have direct impact on public confidence for the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	783	Judges also take account of public concern over the level of sentencing ; and so they should , as witness the increase over the last twenty years in the tariff for causing death by dangerous driving . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	784	In Ex parte Doody Staughton L.J. suggested -LRB- 19931 Q.B. 157 at 197 -RRB- that a distinction should be drawn between material received by the Home Secretary which is directed to penal policy in general , and material directed to a particular case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	785	The latter should be disregarded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	786	But how can such material be distinguished ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	787	The observations of Hobhouse L.J. , which I have quoted , read far too much into the decision letters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	788	The petitions and the letters were not , of course , evidence of anything in any legal sense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	789	But surely they demonstrated a certain level of concern . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	790	It is to the Home Secretary that Parliament has entrusted the task of maintaining public confidence in the criminal justice system , and as part of that task gauging public concern in relation to a particular case when deciding on the earliest release date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	791	I do not regard it as the function of the courts to tell him how to perform that task . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	792	I would therefore allow the Home Secretary 's appeal on the procedural issues . 	lord lloyd	self	outcome	0.7	NAN
87	793	This means that of the ten judges who have taken part in these proceedings , I am the only one to have accepted Mr. Pannick 's submissions on all points . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	794	I would uphold the lawfulness of the Home Secretary 's decision to impose a minimum tariff of 15 years ' detention in the case of these two applicants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	795	That does not , of course , mean that I would necessarily have imposed the same tariff myself , had I been Home Secretary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	796	But that is not the issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	797	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	798	LORD STEYN 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	799	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	800	When they were both aged 10 years Venables and Thompson committed a vicious and cold-blooded murder of a two-year-old boy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	801	The inexpressible grief of the family of the murdered boy will never cease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	802	The family , the local community and society generally are morally outraged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	803	Venables and Thompson will have to spend many years in detention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	804	The only question is whether the Home Secretary in deciding to fix a `` tariff '' sentence of 15 years acted lawfully . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	805	It does not follow that after Venables and Thompson have served any applicable `` tariff '' sentence they will be released . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	806	That is a different question involving an assessment of the risk of releasing them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	807	There appears to be very little that can be said for Venables and Thompson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	808	But they have rights under our law : they are entitled to the full measure of the protection from unlawful action by the Executive afforded by the common law even to prisoners convicted of murder . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	809	And in my judgment the Home Secretary 's decisions affecting them are unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	810	My conclusions on the principal issues : In my view in making his decision to fix a tariff of 15 years the Home Secretary exceeded the statutory powers which he has been given . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	811	I will summarize at the outset my conclusions on the principal issues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	812	Following the same structure I will then explain my reasons for each conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	813	Contrary to the submissions of counsel for Venables , my view is that a major purpose of a sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure imposed upon a child under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 is punishment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	814	Consequentially on this holding I conclude , contrary to the submissions of counsel for Venables , that in principle it is within the power of the Home Secretary to fix a provisional and reviewable tariff under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	815	But I have come to the conclusion that the decisions of the Home Secretary as contained in his letters of 22 July 1994 , which fixed a 15-year tariff for both Venables and Thompson , were unlawful for substantive reasons as well as a breach of the principles of procedural fairness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	816	There are two separate substantive reasons why I conclude that the Home Secretary 's decisions were unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	817	First , the Home Secretary regarded a sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- imposed on a child convicted of murder as in law equivalent to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment imposed on an adult convicted of murder . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	818	His legal premise was wrong : the two sentences are different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	819	A sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure requires the Home Secretary to decide from time to time , taking into account the punitive element , whether detention is still justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	820	The Home Secretary misunderstood his duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	821	This misdirection by itself renders his decision unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	822	Secondly , the Home Secretary misdirected himself by giving weight to public protestations about the level at which the tariff in the cases of Venables and Thompson should be fixed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	823	In doing so the Home Secretary took into account in aggravation of the appropriate level of punishment legally irrelevant considerations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	824	This was a material defect in the reasoning of the Home Secretary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	825	It rendered his decisions unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	826	On the issues of alleged procedural unfairness , I have concluded that the decisions of the Home Secretary were also procedurally flawed by the credence and weight which he gave to public clamour for an increase in the level of the tariff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	827	This point overlaps with my second substantive conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	828	It may be two sides of the same coin : either way the quality of the decision-making was adversely affected in a material way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	829	I will deal with this point under the procedural heading quite briefly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	830	I would reject the other procedural complaints about the decision of the Home Secretary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	831	Punishment Counsel for Venables submitted that the sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure for murder committed by children has always been a sentence designed solely for the reformation of youthful offenders and for the protection of the public . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	832	He argued that punishment has never had any part to play in respect of such a sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	833	On this supposition he submitted that the imposition of a tariff is always inappropriate in the case of young murderers sentenced under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	834	In my view the premise of this argument is wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	835	The Children Act 1908 provided that a child or young person charged with any offence may upon conviction be sentenced to inter alia a whipping or detention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	836	That was a provision for the punishment of children for lesser offences than murder . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	837	When Parliament dealt with murder committed by a child or young person , the sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure can not credibly have been intended to have been entirely non punitive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	838	Moreover the fact that children between the ages of 10 and 14 years may be criminally responsible demonstrates that in law they may deserve punishment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	839	And that consideration must apply to murder as much as to lesser offences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	840	The applicability of a tariff to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure Counsel for the offenders had a more formidable argument against the applicability of a tariff in cases governed by section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	841	By way of alternative submission counsel for Venables said that the sentence must be regarded as partly punitive and partly rehabilitative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	842	But because it is indeterminate and provides for release `` at any time , '' the concept of a predetermined initial punitive phase to be served before release is inconsistent with the purpose of the sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	843	Counsel for Thompson also argued that a tariff was inappropriate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	844	He said that the correct approach is that at such time as the particular young offenders involved in this case are found to be rehabilitated the Home Secretary should ask himself whether they have been sufficiently punished . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	845	Initially I was attracted to a line of reasoning that any tariff is contrary to the purpose and policy of a sentence under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	846	On balance I have come to the conclusion that this is not a correct analysis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	847	If punishment is a purpose of such a sentence , as it is , it is difficult to say that a Home Secretary charged with the decision of giving content to what `` detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure '' means in a particular case may not in his discretion make a provisional and subsequently reviewable judgment as to what ought to be the period to be served as punishment by a particular offender . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	848	And , if that it so , it is clearly right that his decision should be notified to the offender . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	849	In other words , I regard the discretionary power to set a provisional and reviewable tariff as inherent in the statutory power entrusted by Parliament to the Home Secretary since 1908 , i.e. the power to decide how in an individual case the power to detain during Her Majesty 's pleasure should be exercised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	850	The misconception as to the nature of the sentence The Home Secretary treated two sentences for murder as exactly alike , namely -LRB- 1 -RRB- a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment passed on an adult convicted of murder and -LRB- 2 -RRB- a mandatory sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure passed on a child or young person convicted of murder . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	851	He emphasised that in a policy statement to the House of Commons of 27 July 1993 in the following words : `` Everything that I have said about the practice of the Secretary of State in relation to mandatory life sentence prisoners applies equally to persons who are , or will be , detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	852	In the same policy statement he contrasted the position of a prisoner subject to a mandatory life sentence with that of a prisoner subject to a discretionary life sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	853	Once the minimum period fixed for retribution and deterrence has been satisfied , and provided that he is no longer a risk , a prisoner serving a discretionary life sentence is entitled to be released : section 34 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	854	But a more severe regime applies to prisoners convicted of murder who are subject to mandatory life sentences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	855	The Home Secretary endorsed the `` practice '' that an adult prisoner subject to mandatory life sentence has forfeited his liberty to the state for the rest of his days . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	856	He said that the `` presumption '' is that such a prisoner should remain in custody until the Home Secretary concludes that the public interest would be better served by the prisoner 's release than by his continued detention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	857	This is how the Home Secretary also viewed the nature of a sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	858	It is now necessary to examine the correctness of the Home Secretary 's view of a section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	859	In order to understand the nature of a sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure it is necessary to start with the position before the Children Act 1908 was enacted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	860	For this purpose I gratefully draw on a report prepared by Professor A. W. B. Simpson , the distinguished legal historian , and submitted to the European Court in the case of Prem Singh v. U.K. Application No. 23389/94 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	861	Until the Children Act of 1908 the formal law -LRB- as opposed to Home Office practice -RRB- made no special provision for children or young persons convicted of murder . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	862	In strict law youthful convicted murderers could be executed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	863	But it became the practice not to execute murderers who were under the age of 18 years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	864	It is probable that whenever a convicted murderer was reprieved on account of youth , a life sentence of penal servitude would have been imposed , and the individual would only have been released after serving a conventional period of twenty years unless he was then thought to be still dangerous . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	865	This practice was consistent with the notion that if children were criminally responsible they were amenable to exactly the same punishments as adults . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	866	Gradually , that policy fell into disfavour : the view gained ground that all juvenile offenders formed a distinct category of offenders for whom special arrangements for disposal should be made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	867	The Children Act 1908 was a reforming measure which throughout reflected this change in attitude to young offenders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	868	Thus it abolished the use of prisons for offenders under 14 ; it abolished penal servitude for those under it ; and it permitted imprisonment for those between 14 and 16 only exceptionally . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	869	Section 103 formally abolished a sentence of death against a child or young person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	870	That left the important question of the substitute penalty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	871	Following previous practice regarding the punishment of children convicted of murder Parliament could have provided for a sentence of life imprisonment , or for detention for life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	872	But Parliament chose not to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	873	Instead the Act of 1908 provided that the new sentence to be imposed on children -LRB- those between 8 and 14 -RRB- and young persons -LRB- those between 14 and 16 -RRB- would be detention during His Majesty 's pleasure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	874	And the statute provided that , if so sentenced , the child or young person would be liable to be detained in such place and under such conditions as the Secretary of State directed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	875	Professor Simpson commented on this change in the following terms : `` If , as I think very probable , the practice before 1908 when a young -LRB- under 18 -RRB- murder was reprieved was to grant a conditional pardon , with commutation to penal servitude for life , then the provision in the Act of 1908 involved a deliberate change in practice , and shows an intention to set up a regime for young persons convicted of murder which was significantly different from that for reprieved adults . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	876	At the time this Act was passed the conception of `` detention during H.M. pleasure '' existed in statutory form only in relation to criminal lunatics . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	877	When it was transferred to this new context , it formed part of an elaborate legislative scheme which reflected a general policy of treating young offenders quite differently from older ones . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	878	It would therefore be a misunderstanding of the policy of the Act to view detention at H.M. 's pleasure under the 1908 Act as the same in all but name as the life sentence of imprisonment imposed under conditional pardon granted to adult reprieved murderers . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	879	This reasoning seems correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	880	Counsel for the Home Secretary , despite express invitation to comment on the purpose of section 103 of the Act of 1908 , offered no argument to the contrary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	881	Detention during His Majesty 's pleasure , the term of sentence selected by Parliament in 1908 for children convicted of murder , was intended to involve -LRB- subject to matters of the risk of releasing the individual -RRB- a less severe form of sentence than imprisonment for life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	882	After all , a sentence of life imprisonment involves an order that an individual be imprisoned for life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	883	By contrast a sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure merely authorizes detention of an individual for life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	884	Subsequently , Parliament revisited this subject . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	885	Section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 re-enacted section 103 in respect of persons under 18 convicted of murder . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	886	The Act of 1933 was preceded by a detailed inquiry into the way in which the criminal justice system treated children and young persons : Report of the Departmental Committee on the Treatment of Young Offenders -LRB- 1927 -RRB- -LRB- Cmnd . 2831 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	887	The report did not specifically deal with detention during His Majesty 's pleasure : the matter had been settled in 1908 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	888	On the other hand , the report described the Children Act 1908 as `` a notable piece of legislation , enshrining as it did in almost every section the principle that a young offender shall receive different treatment from an adult '' -LRB- p. 8 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	889	And that philosophy of differentiating between sentences imposed on adults and children and young persons was carried forward in the report and the resulting statute of 1933 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	890	The Murder -LRB- Abolition of Death Penalty -RRB- Act 1965 repealed section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and substituted the following section : `` A person convicted of an offence who appears to the court to have been under the age of eighteen years at the time the offence was committed shall not , if he is convicted of murder , be sentenced to imprisonment for life , nor shall sentence of death be pronounced on or recorded against any such person ; but in lieu thereof the court shall -LRB- notwithstanding anything in this or in any other Act -RRB- sentence him to be detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure , and if so sentenced he shall be liable to be detained in such place and under such conditions as the Secretary of State may direct .

87	891	Before this provision was enacted the Ingleby Committee Report of the Committee on Children and Young Persons -LRB- 1960 -RRB- -LRB- Cmnd . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	892	1191 -RRB- had made a wide ranging report on the position of children and young persons in the criminal justice system . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	893	The report and the subsequent statute did not specifically deal with detention during His Majesty 's pleasure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	894	The report did , however , emphatically endorse the policy differentiating between the sentencing of adults and juvenile offenders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	895	The report observed that originally the principle of equality before the law meant that children were hanged , transported or imprisoned on the same principles applicable to adults : paragraph 53 -LRB- d -RRB- The report stated in categorical terms that the conception of a standard or ordinary punishment applicable to everyone , child or adult , had gone : paragraph 58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	896	This is the culture in which section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- was re-enacted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	897	In respect of persons convicted of murder , who were between the ages of 18 and 21 , Parliament provided for a sentence of custody for life : section 8 of the Criminal Justice Act 1982 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	898	This section expressly distinguishes between the two forms of sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	899	The new philosophy which was adopted in 1908 has therefore repeatedly been reaffirmed by Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
87	900	The effect of the relevant legislation is as follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	901	Parliament differentiated between the two sentences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	902	An order of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure involves merely an authority to detain indefinitely . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	903	That means that the Home Secretary must decide from time to time , taking into account the punitive element , whether detention is still justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	904	Life imprisonment involves an order of custody for life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	905	That means , as the Home Office has interpreted the sentence of mandatory life imprisonment , that the Home Secretary must consider whether and when release is justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	906	These are obviously wholly different approaches . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	907	Judgments - Reg . v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte V. and Reg . v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte T. continued It was , of course , possible for Parliament subsequently to reverse the policy adopted in 1908 and repeatedly re-affirmed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	908	Counsel for the Home Secretary said that Parliament did so by provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	909	Carefully distancing himself from the view that a section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- sentence `` is the same '' as a sentence of life imprisonment , counsel for the Home Secretary said that the Criminal Justice Act of 1991 shows that Parliament was satisfied that a section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- sentence had sufficient similarities to a mandatory life sentence imposed on an adult murderer to make it appropriate to deal with the question of release on life licence of prisoners in both categories under the same provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	910	As I understood the argument it involves saying that Parliament in effect assimilated the two sentences and that in fixing a tariff for Venables and Thompson the Home Secretary was entitled to proceed on the basis that , like adults serving mandatory life sentences , they had forfeited the rest of their lives to the state . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	911	This argument crucially depends on two sections in the Criminal Justice Act 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	912	Section 43 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1991 provides that the provisions for release apply to section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- sentences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	913	This is a reference to section 35 -LRB- 2 -RRB- which provides that if the Parole Board so recommends , the Home Secretary may , after consulting the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge , release on life licence a life prisoner who is not a discretionary life prisoner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	914	By section 35 -LRB- 2 -RRB- `` life prisoner '' includes a child or young person sentenced under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	915	These provisions are perfectly consistent with the policy that a sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure is a sentence different in conception from a sentence of mandatory life imprisonment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	916	These are procedural provisions which do not alter the nature of the section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	917	It is true that there is similarity between a section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- sentence and a sentence of life imprisonment in the sense that all persons released on licence shall remain in force until their death : section 37 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Act of 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	918	That is unremarkable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	919	It tells us nothing about the nature of a section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	920	It is necessary to put counsel 's arguments in context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	921	It postulates that in 1991 Parliament reversed the policy it had adopted in 1908 , and reaffirmed subsequently , by assimilating the sentences of children and young persons convicted of murder with adults convicted of murder . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	922	Given that no dissatisfaction with the conception of a sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure ever became public such a change of direction would have been surprising . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	923	The merits of such a radical change , contrary to the long standing policy of differentiating between the sentences of adults and children , were never debated in public or in Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	924	The Act of 1991 was preceded by a White Paper published by the Government : Crime , Justice and Protecting the Public , February 1990 , reprinted in -LRB- 1990 -RRB- , -LRB- Cm . 965 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	925	The White Paper contained no proposal for assimilating the two sentences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	926	Moreover , since 1908 there has been an ever-increasing awareness of the need to treat juvenile criminals as a separate class . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	927	It became an axiom of our criminal justice system . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	928	The reason for this change in public perception was neatly encapsulated in the following proposition : `` No civilized society regards children as accountable for their actions to the same extent as adults '' -LRB- Howard , Criminal Law , 4th ed . -LRB- 1982 -RRB- , p. 343 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	929	This proposition is a quotation endorsed by Lord Lowry in C. -LRB- A Minor -RRB- v. Director of Public Prosecutions -LSB- 1996 -RSB- 1 A.C. 1 , 40C , in a speech which carried the agreement of all his fellow Law Lords . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	930	Against this contextual scene an express legislative proposal to assimilate section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- sentences for juvenile murderers with mandatory life sentences for adult murderers , or to substitute for the sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure for children a sentence of detention for life , would have been deeply controversial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	931	In effect counsel for the Home Secretary has put forward an argument that Parliament achieved this radical result by an oblique legislative method . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	932	If his argument were to be accepted it would amount to legislation by stealth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	933	But the truth is that the argument that in 1991 Parliament intended to assimilate section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- sentences and mandatory life sentences is misconceived . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	934	It follows that in making his decisions the Home Secretary wrongly equated the sentences of Venables and Thompson with that applicable to adults convicted of murder . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	935	I will assume that the Home Secretary was entitled to apply a `` practice '' that a prisoner serving a mandatory life sentence has forfeited his life to the State and that the `` presumption '' must be that the prisoner will spend the rest of his days in prison . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	936	But in my judgment this practice is plainly not legitimate in respect of the different sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	937	Section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- is based on the premise that , to some extent , children are less accountable for their actions than adults . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	938	Subject to continued detention for reasons of risk , a section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- was intended to be a more merciful punishment than life imprisonment : see Lord Woolf M.R. 's observations on this point in : Reg . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

87	940	The Home Secretary misunderstood the legal nature of the sentence in respect of which he was called upon to exercise a discretion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	941	He did take the ages of Venables and Thompson into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	942	But he misinterpreted the sentence prescribed by law for children convicted of murder . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	943	He did so to the detriment of Venables and Thompson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	944	The Home Secretary 's decisions were therefore unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	945	For the same reasons his policy statement of 27 July 1993 to the House of Commons was unlawful so far as it related to section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- sentences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	946	The public clamour for an increase in the tariff The Home Secretary rightly invited representations about the level of the tariff from solicitors acting for the two young prisoners . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	947	The letter written on his behalf included the following paragraph : `` The Bulger family have submitted a petition , signed by some 278,300 members of the public , in the following terms : ` We , the undersigned , urge the Home Secretary when considering the `` tariff '' sentence to be imposed on Robert Thompson and Jon Venables to take account of our belief that they should not be released in any circumstances and should be detained for life . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	948	At the same time , the family submitted some 4,400 letters to them from members of the public in their support . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	949	Mr. George Howarth M.P. -LRB- Knowsley North -RRB- has submitted a petition at the request of relatives of the Bulger family . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	950	It is signed by some 5,900 members of the public , and is in the following terms : ` We the undersigned are of the opinion that the minimum sentence served by Robert Thompson and Jon Venables should be twenty-five years . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	951	A total of 22,638 items of correspondence has been received directly by the Home Office at the time of writing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	952	This comprises 21,281 Sun newspaper coupons in support of a whole life tariff , and 1,357 letters and small petitions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	953	The coupons linked with the Sun newspaper followed a campaign under headlines such as `` 80,000 call T.V. to say Bulger killers must rot in jail . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	954	Each coupon contained the word `` Dear Home Secretary I agree with Ralph and Denise Bulger that the boys who killed their son James should stay in jail for LIFE . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	955	The decision letters of the Home Secretary dated 22 July 1994 contained the following paragraph : `` In making his decision , the Secretary of State had regard to the circumstances of the offence , the recommendations received from the judiciary , the representations made on your behalf and the extent to which this case could be compared with other cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	956	He also had regard to the public concern about this case , which was evidenced by the petitions and other correspondence the substance of which were disclosed to your solicitors by our letter of 16 June 1994 , and to the need to maintain public confidence in the system of criminal justice . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	957	-LRB- My emphasis -RRB- The Home Secretary regarded `` the public concern about this case '' as evidenced by the `` petitions and other correspondence '' as evidence in favour of increasing the tariff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	958	It is clear from the earlier letter that the `` correspondence '' included the 21,281 Sun coupons which were treated as part of the 22,638 items of correspondence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	959	It is perfectly understandable that the family of the murdered boy felt very strongly about the sentence to be served by the killers of the little boy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	960	But it is quite another matter whether the Home Secretary was entitled to take into account such protests , and other media inspired protests , about the level of the tariff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	961	The Home Secretary in fixing a tariff may , like a sentencing judge , take into account the general consideration of public confidence in the criminal justice system . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	962	He may also take into account a more specific feature such as public concern about the severity , or lack of severity , of sentences imposed on children for crimes of violence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	963	But may the Home Secretary take into account public clamour about the tariff to be fixed in a particular case ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	964	May he treat as relevant a newspaper campaign to obtain an increase in the tariff ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	965	May he take into account a demonstration in Queen Anne 's Gate to protest about the tariff to be imposed ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	966	For my part the matter can be decided on a twofold basis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	967	First , the material in fact taken into account by the Home Secretary was worthless and incapable of informing him in a meaningful way of the true state of informed public opinion in respect of the tariff to be set in the cases of Venables and Thompson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	968	By `` informed public opinion '' I mean public opinion formed in the knowledge of all the material facts of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	969	Plainly , the `` evidence '' to which the Home Secretary referred did not measure up to his standard . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	970	It was therefore irrelevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	971	But the Home Secretary was influenced by it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	972	He gave weight to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	973	On this ground his decision is unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	974	But the objection to the course adopted by the Home Secretary is more fundamental . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	975	The starting point must be to inquire into the nature of the power to fix a tariff which the Home Secretary exercised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	976	Writing on behalf of the Home Secretary the Home Office explained in correspondence placed before us that : '' -LSB- The Home Secretary -RSB- must ensure that , at all times , he acts with the same dispassionate sense of fairness as a sentencing judge . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	977	The comparison between the position of the Home Secretary , when he fixes a tariff representing the punitive element of the sentence , and the position of a sentencing judge is correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	978	In fixing a tariff the Home Secretary is carrying out , contrary to the constitutional principle of separation of powers , a classic judicial function : see Lord Diplock 's explanation of the importance of the separation of powers between the Executive and the judiciary in Hinds v . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	979	The Queen -LSB- 1977 -RSB- A.C. 195 , 212 ; and Dupont Steels Ltd. v. Sirs -LSB- 1980 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 142 , 157 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	980	Parliament entrusted the underlying statutory power , which entailed a discretion to adopt a policy of fixing a tariff , to the Home Secretary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	981	But the power to fix a tariff is nevertheless equivalent to a judge 's sentencing power . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	982	Parliament must be assumed to have acted have entrusted the power to the Home Secretary on the supposition that , like a sentencing judge , the Home Secretary would not act contrary to fundamental principles governing the administrative of justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	983	Plainly a sentencing judge must ignore a newspaper campaign designed to encourage him to increase a particular sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	984	It would be an abdication of the rule of law for a judge to take into account such matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	985	The same reasoning must apply to the Home Secretary when he is exercising a sentencing function . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	986	He ought to concentrate on the facts of the case and balance considerations of public interest against the dictates of justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	987	Like a judge the Home Secretary ought not to be guided by a disposition to consult how popular a particular decision might be . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	988	He ought to ignore the high voltage atmosphere of a newspaper campaign . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	989	The power given to him requires , above all , a detached approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	990	I would therefore hold that public protests about the level of a tariff to be fixed in a particular case are legally irrelevant and may not be taken into account by the Home Secretary in fixing the tariff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	991	I conclude that the Home Secretary misdirected himself in giving weight to irrelevant considerations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	992	It influenced his decisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	993	And it did so to the detriment of Venables and Thompson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	994	For this further reason I conclude that his decisions were unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	995	Procedural unfairness For the reasons I have already given I would also hold that by giving weight to public clamour about the tariff the Home Secretary acted in a procedurally unfair way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	996	In my judgment the remaining allegations of procedural unfairness are not made out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	997	Form of relief It follows that for substantive reasons I would allow the cross-appeals and for a procedural reason I would dismiss the appeal . 	lord steyn	self	outcome	0.8	NAN
87	998	In my judgment declaratory relief is not necessary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

87	1001	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	1002	Two questions require to be answered in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	1003	The first is whether the Secretary of State acted unlawfully when he applied to the applicants , who had been sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 , the same policy as he applies to adult mandatory life sentence prisoners in regard to the period to be served by them in custody to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence -- the tariff period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	1004	The second is whether his decisions on the tariff , as set out in the letters dated 22 July 1994 which were written on his behalf to the applicants , were reached in a manner which was procedurally unfair to them and was thus an improper exercise of the discretion which is vested in him by section 35 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	1005	I have come to the view that each of these two questions should be answered in the affirmative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	1006	The offence of which the applicants were convicted was , when measured by the ordinary standards of human conduct , an exceptionally cruel and sadistic one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	1007	As the writer of the two decision letters has pointed out , it was committed over a period of several hours against a victim who was very young and defenceless . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	1008	It was all the more horrifying because the two perpetrators were themselves of such a young age . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	1009	If it had been committed by an adult an exceptionally long tariff period would have been entirely justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	1010	But the applicants were not adults when they committed this offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	1011	They were children , and because they were only ten years old at the time they were only just within the age of criminal responsibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	1012	Had the applicants been only a few months younger -- Jon Venables was born on 13th August 1982 , Robert Thompson was born on 23 August 1982 and the murder was committed ten years and six months later on 12 February 1993 -- they could not have been held responsible for this crime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	1013	As it was , since they were over ten but under fourteen years old , and of an age when the understanding , knowledge and ability to reason of children is still developing , the presumption that they were doli incapax had to be rebutted in their case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	1014	The fact that it was rebutted meant that they could be convicted of the crime , on the view that they were fully responsible for their actions because they knew that what they were doing was seriously wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	1015	But the fact that they were under the age of 18 when the offence was committed meant that they could not be sentenced to life imprisonment The mandatory sentence which was passed in their case was that they were to be detained during her Majesty 's pleasure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	1016	It is this feature of the case which has presented and will continue to present the Secretary of State with questions of unusual difficulty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	1017	It was inevitable that the trial and the conviction of the applicants would attract widespread publicity and that strong emotions would be aroused . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	1018	The fact that the tariff-fixing process has been conducted in public also and that it has resulted in this litigation , one effect of which will be to prolong that publicity , has greatly increased the difficulty of dealing with the case in a just way , which takes proper account of the age of the applicants and the nature of the sentences which were passed by the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	1019	I believe that some measure of detachment from the pressure of public opinion is essential if a just result which is consistent with the rights of the applicants as children is to be achieved in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
87	1020	A judge when passing a determinate sentence or when advising the Secretary of State about the tariff to be served by a life prisoner is expected to be able to resist that pressure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1021	Indeed he can be relied upon to do so , in view of his independence which is such a vital characteristic of the judiciary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1022	It is so much more difficult for the Secretary of State to do this as he is , in the exercise of the discretion which is given to him by section 35 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1991 , in the end answerable to Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1023	But there are limits to his discretion , as he can not adopt a policy which is unlawful or act unfairly in matters of procedure in the application of his policy to the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1024	It is at this point that his decisions appear to have come into conflict with the rights of the applicants who , although convicted of a crime of such extreme gravity , were and are nevertheless still children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1025	They are entitled to be dealt with fairly according to a policy which is lawful as they begin to serve the sentences which were imposed on them as required by the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1026	The policy Every system of criminal justice has had to face up to the problem of how to deal with children who commit crimes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1027	It is worth repeating here the words with which Harper J. began his judgment in Regina -LRB- A Child -RRB- v. Whitty -LRB- 1993 -RRB- 66 A.Crim.R . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

87	1041	These rules have now been modified -LRB- 1 -RRB- by raising the threshold of criminal responsibility , first to eight years and then to ten years : see section 50 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 , as amended by section 16 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Children and Young Persons Act 1963 ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- by introducing a system of penalties and other disposals which have been designed specially for young offenders : see Part V of the Children Act 1908 , on which all subsequent statutes dealing with this matter have been based .

87	1043	One has to look at the whole picture , including the nature of the sentences which the court can impose and the way in which they are administered , in order to see whether the effect of placing criminal responsibility on children as young as the applicants are in this case is objectionable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1044	Nor is the fact that the United Kingdom stands alone in Europe in requiring the court to impose an indeterminate sentence on children and young persons convicted of murder which is not to be judicially supervised necessarily a ground for criticism either , provided that the right policy is applied to the working out of these sentences .

87	1045	It is not for your Lordships to say what that policy should be . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1046	This is a matter which must be left to the Secretary of State , to whom the discretion in this matter has been entrusted by Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

87	1050	The context for the decision which is under review in this case is provided by Part III of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 , in which section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of that Act appears . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1051	That Part is entitled `` Protection of Children and Young Persons in relation to Criminal and Summary Proceedings . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1052	Section 44 of the same Act , which also appears in Part III and has as its headnote the words `` Principles to be observed by all Courts in dealing with Children and Young Persons , '' states that every court in dealing with a child or young person who is brought before it `` shall have regard to the welfare of the child or young person . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1053	Protection and welfare thus lie at the heart of the provisions in this Part of the Act , although many of the sections which it contains are concerned also with punishment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1054	Your Lordships were not referred to any enactment which suggests that these principles are not still applicable to the way children and young persons are entitled to be treated by the courts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1055	It was suggested that section 44 could not apply to the provisions of section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , as the sentence which is laid down by that section is mandatory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1056	But there is no indication in Part III of the Act that this subsection is in a different position from the other provisions which that Part of the Act contains . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1057	Where there is a discretion to be exercised -- and the discretion to make a recommendation under section 1 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Murder -LRB- Abolition of Death Penalty -RRB- Act 1965 is one example -- the welfare of the child must be taken into account by the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

87	1059	That seems to me to follow from the fact that the sentence which he is required to administer is one which has been laid down by this Part of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1060	The principles of protection and welfare are therefore as relevant to section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- detainees as they are to those who are serving determinate sentences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1061	They apply to plans for the future of these detainees as well as to the conditions under which they are presently being held . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

87	1063	It is worth noting also that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child -LRB- 1989 -RRB- 28 International Legal Materials 1448 , which was ratified by the United Kingdom on 16 December 1991 , draws attention to the rights of the child who has committed an offence .

87	1067	Mr. Pannick 's submission for the Secretary of State was that the nature of the sentence under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 did not confine the discretion of the Secretary of State as to release under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1068	It was on this ground that he sought to defend the policy which the Home Secretary announced to Parliament on 27 July 1993 , when he stated that everything he had said about the practice of the Secretary of State in relation to mandatory life prisoners applied equally to prisoners who were , or would be , detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 and to persons who had been , or would be , sentenced to custody for life under section 8 of the Criminal Justice Act 1982 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1069	In his statement he specifically endorsed this part of a statement to Parliament by the then Minister of State , Dame Angela Rumbold , on 16 July 1991 : `` According to the judicial process , the offender has committed a crime of such gravity that he forfeits his liberty to the State for the rest of his days -- if necessary , he can be detained for life without the necessity for subsequent judicial intervention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1070	The presumption is , therefore , that the offender should remain in custody until and unless the Home Secretary concludes that the public interest would be better served by the prisoner 's release than by his continued detention . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1071	The theory as restated in that passage was said in Regina v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte Doody -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 A.C. 531 , 556B-C by Lord Mustill to be the only theory which could justify the retention of the mandatory sentence of imprisonment for life for adult persons convicted of murder , which the court must impose under section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Murder -LRB- Abolition of Death Penalty -RRB- Act 1965 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1072	As he pointed out in the same passage , the theory and the practice for convicted murderers are out of tune , as the practice established by Mr. Leon Brittan , the then Home Secretary , in 1983 is based on the proposition that within the life term there is concealed a fixed period of years which is the penal element . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1073	It is this practice which has led to the fixing of the `` tariff '' by the Home Secretary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1074	The release of the mandatory life sentence prisoner on life licence is a measure of leniency , as the proper `` tariff '' sentence for murder is life imprisonment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1075	But I do not think that the same theory , and the practice which has been developed from it , can be applied to persons who have been sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 as substituted by section 1 -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the Act of 1965 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1076	If the same theory could be applied to them as to adult prisoners there would have been no point in providing for the imposition on them of a different penalty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1077	Yet section 1 -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the Act of 1965 went out of its way to require that a different sentence from that of life imprisonment under section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of that Act was to be imposed in the case of children and young persons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1078	It did not just re-enact the provisions of section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 , which had re-enacted in almost precisely the same words the provisions of section 103 of the Children Act 1908 , which was in these terms : `` Sentence of death shall not be pronounced on or recorded against a child or young person , but in lieu thereof the court shall sentence the child or young person to be detained during His Majesty 's pleasure , and , if so sentenced , he shall , notwithstanding anything in the other provisions of this Act , be liable to be detained in such place and under such conditions as the Secretary of State may direct , and whilst so detained shall be deemed to be in legal custody . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1079	What section 1 -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the Act of 1965 did was to amend that section by directing attention to the age of the person at the time when the offence was committed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1080	It provides that a person convicted of an offence : `` who appears to the court to have been under the age of eighteen years at the time the offence was committed shall not , if he is convicted of murder , be sentenced to imprisonment for life , nor shall sentence of death be pronounced on or recorded against him . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1081	There is here an express prohibition against the imposition on him of a sentence of life imprisonment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1082	And it is not just the word `` imprisonment , '' which is plainly inappropriate in the case of a child or young person , that has been removed by this direction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1083	The word `` life '' also has been removed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1084	The sentence which is to be imposed instead is that of `` detention , '' which is to be not for life but `` during Her Majesty 's pleasure . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1085	Moreover that direction is related specifically to the age of the person at the time of the offence , not at the time of sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1086	It does not matter how old the person is at the time when he is convicted of the crime and is being sentenced for his offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1087	Even if he is over twenty-one , and thus liable to be imprisoned as an adult prisoner , his sentence must be one of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure if he was under eighteen years when he committed the murder . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1088	In my opinion the effect of section 1 -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the Act of 1965 is that the sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure is a separate and distinct sentence from that of life imprisonment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1089	It recognises the special characteristics of the young offender , and especially of the child offender . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1090	There is built into the sentence a measure of leniency in view of the age of the offender at the time of the offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1091	The measure of that leniency is that , in his case , in the working out of the sentence punishment and welfare , present and future , are both equally relevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1092	He is to be detained without limit of time , but expressly on terms which do not deprive him of his liberty for the rest of his days . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1093	I agree with the Master of the Rolls -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 2 W.L.R. 67 , 83H-84A , that the discretion as to release which is to be exercised by the Secretary of State in the case of these two sentences is a different one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1094	In the case of the mandatory life sentence it is a discretion to bring custody to an end . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1095	In the case of the detainee during Her Majesty 's pleasure , it is a discretion to continue custody for as long , but only for as long , as this is appropriate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1096	This means that the child 's progress and development while in custody , as well as the requirements of punishment , must be kept under review throughout the sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1097	A policy which ignores at any stage the child 's development and progress while in custody as a factor relevant to his eventual release date is an unlawful policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1098	The practice of fixing the penal element as applied to adult mandatory life prisoners , which has no regard to the development and progress of the prisoner during this period , can not be reconciled with the requirement to keep the protection and welfare of the child under review throughout the period while he is in custody . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1099	It may be said that this approach is so out of line with what happens in the case of children and young persons who are sentenced to determinate sentences , or to detention for life at the discretion of the trial judge under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 , that it is not sustainable and must be rejected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1100	But I am not persuaded by this objection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1101	The sentences which are imposed in these cases are all judicial sentences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1102	A determinate sentence is one which has been selected by the trial judge , having due regard to the provisions of section 44 of the Act of 1933 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1103	A discretionary life sentence also is one which the trial judge has selected , and to which he has applied the penal element as he is required to do by section 34 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1104	In neither case is the child or young person exposed to the determination of the penal element by the Secretary of State after taking into account considerations of policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1105	And if , as can not be doubted , section 44 of the Act of 1933 must be taken into account by the judge when passing the sentence which he decides to impose , it would seem both illogical and unfair if the child or young person were to be deprived of that protection in cases where the mandatory sentence under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- was pronounced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1106	Mr. Pannick submitted that it was clear that Parliament had not adopted a special regime for those sentenced to detention under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 because it had expressly provided in section 43 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1991 that , for the purpose of release , the provisions relating to life sentences were to apply also to section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- sentences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1107	There is no doubt that section 43 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Act of 1991 does have that effect , but that does not mean that the whole regime is the same . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1108	What section 43 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- does is to apply the provisions of Part II of the Act to those sentenced to detention under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 as well as to those sentenced to life imprisonment -- that is , to discretionary life imprisonment -- under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the same Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1109	In the result those sentenced to discretionary life imprisonment under section 53 -LRB- 2 -RRB- are classed as discretionary life prisoners . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1110	They require to be dealt with under the same procedure for early release as adult life sentence prisoners under section 34 of the Act of 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1111	Those sentenced to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure as classed as life prisoners for the purposes of that Part of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1112	In this respect , but in this respect only , they are to be dealt with in the same way as adult mandatory life sentence prisoners under section 35 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Act of 1991 , which provide : '' -LRB- 2 -RRB- If recommended to do so by the -LSB- Parole -RSB- Board , the Secretary of State may , after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice together with the trial judge if available , release on licence a life prisoner who is not a discretionary life prisoner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1113	-LRB- 3 -RRB- The Board shall not make a recommendation under subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- above unless the Secretary of State has referred the particular case , or the class of case to which that case belongs , to the Board for its advice . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1114	Where I part company with Mr. Pannick 's argument is with respect to the conclusion which he sought to draw from the assimilation of the section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- detainee with the adult mandatory life prisoner for the purposes of the Act of 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1115	He said that this meant that the Secretary of State was entitled to apply the same criteria in regard to the exercise of discretion about the release of prisoners in each of these two categories . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1116	His argument was that Parliament was satisfied that the two sentences had sufficient similarities to make it appropriate to deal with them under the same provisions when it came to their release on life licence , and that if Parliament had intended different criteria to apply it was impossible to understand why it had provided for the release of prisoners in both categories under the same general provision which conferred a broad discretion on the Secretary of State as to their release . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1117	In my opinion this argument confuses questions of procedure with questions as to the criteria which may be applied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1118	Part II of the Act of 1991 was concerned essentially with questions of procedure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1119	It set out to classify the various categories of prisoner with a view to providing for their early release from custody . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1120	A distinction was drawn , as regards the duty to release , between short-term and long-term prisoners . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1121	These were to be the two categories which were to be applicable to those sentenced to determinate sentences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1122	A further distinction was drawn between discretionary life sentence prisoners and mandatory life prisoners , who were described as life prisoners for the purposes of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1123	In the case of discretionary life prisoners , section 34 laid down the conditions under which there was to be a duty to release this category of prisoner on licence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1124	Following the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Thynne , Wilson and Gunnell v. United Kingdom -LRB- 1990 -RRB- 13 E.H.R.R. 666 that the applicants were entitled to judicial control of their detention by virtue of Article 5 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the European Convention , the Secretary of State was to release this category of life prisoner or detainee when the Parole Board directed his release . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1125	In the case of mandatory life prisoners there was to be no such duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1126	Instead , in their case , there was to be a power to release under the procedure which section 35 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and -LRB- 3 -RRB- laid down . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1127	But nothing is said in either of these two subsections about the criteria which the Secretary of State is to apply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1128	They are concerned only with the procedure which he has to follow , which involves a recommendation for release by the Parole Board and prior consultation with the judiciary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1129	Furthermore the procedure which these two subsections lay down is precisely the same as that which was set out for all life prisoners , and for all detainees under section 53 of the Act of 1933 , in section 61 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1130	What the Act of 1991 did , when it repealed that section , was to separate out the various kinds of life prisoners and detainees into two different categories . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1131	It did so in order to distinguish between those sentences which were discretionary and those which were mandatory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1132	I can find nothing in the legislative history or in the terminology of these provisions which would entitle the Secretary of State to conclude that the distinction between the sentences of life imprisonment and of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure , which was preserved so clearly by section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the Act of 1965 , has been removed by the Act of 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1133	Nor can I find anything which would entitle him to conclude that he was entitled to treat them , for the purposes of their consideration for release on life licence , as if the effect of the Act of 1991 was that the section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- detainee had had imposed on him the same consequences in regard to punishment as in the case of the mandatory life sentence prisoner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1134	In my opinion the Secretary of State 's policy , as described by him in his statement of 27 July 1993 , was unlawful because it failed to recognise that different criteria continue to apply to those sentenced to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure , having regard both to the terms of the sentence and to its history . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1135	The wording of the sentence indicates that the duration of the sentence , as well as the place and the conditions of the detention , must be kept under review by the Secretary of State during the time while the detainee remains in custody . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1136	At one time a direction that a convicted person was to be detained during His Majesty 's pleasure was a means of enabling the execution of the sentence to be deferred with a view to the possibility of a reprieve . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1137	Then the phrase came to be used for the disposal where the person was suffering from a mental disorder or , in Scotland , was unable to stand trial for this reason or was found to be insane by the jury : see section 87 of the Lunacy -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1857 and section 2 of the Trial of Lunatics Act 1883 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1138	Neither consideration is , of course , relevant to a sentence of detention which is passed under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1139	But the selection of the words appropriate for this form of disposal can not be regarded as wholly detached from their historical background . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
87	1140	It is the concept of continuing review , with the prospect of rehabilitation and release from custody at some time in the future , albeit on life licence , which marks this sentence out for the application of different criteria from the sentence of life imprisonment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1141	The Secretary of State 's policy has overlooked that distinction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1142	Judgments - Reg . v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte V. and Reg . v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte T. continued That oversight has , in its turn , vitiated the decision which he took in regard to the tariff which was to be served by the applicants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1143	I agree with Pill L.J. in the Divisional Court that it was inconsistent with the duty to keep their detention under review to fix a tariff of 15 years in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1144	The effect of such a long tariff was to preclude consideration of their case by the Parole Board for twelve years , by which time the applicants would have ceased to be young persons and would have been moved into prison conditions with adults . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1145	But it is not only the length of the tariff which gives rise to concern . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1146	The absence of any reference in the decision letters to a recognition by the Secretary of State of the duty to keep the progress and development of the children under review shows that he has proceeded upon an unlawful policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1147	I do not regard the assurance at the end of these letters that he was prepared to consider any fresh representations and to reduce the tariff if appropriate as providing an answer to this criticism . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1148	He made it clear in his policy statement that he would do this only in exceptional circumstances , and your Lordships were informed that this would not include the progress or development of the applicants while they were in custody . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1149	In paragraph 8 of his affidavit , Mr Ian Newton of H.M. Prison Service , whose responsibilities in the Lifer Section include consideration of and advice on the setting of the tariff period of imprisonment , states : `` If , as a result of Home Office psychiatric assessments of the Applicants , any fresh information comes to light which is relevant to the circumstances of the offences , or the Applicants ' state of mind when the offences were committed , the Secretary of State will consider its relevance to the tariff , and act accordingly -LRB- whether or not he is asked to do so by the Applicants or their representatives -RRB- . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1150	This statement is consistent with the view that the tariff period has fixed the penal element of the sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1151	But it clearly has nothing to do with the question of keeping the period of detention under review in order to take account of the applicants ' progress while in custody . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1152	I agree also with the Master of the Rolls -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 2 W.L.R. 67 , 92C that there was an almost irresistible case here for considering whether the tariff approach should be departed from . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1153	I mention this not by way of criticism of the decision on procedural grounds , but rather to emphasise what I see as a serious conflict between the process of tariff-fixing which the Secretary of State embarked upon in this case and his duty to keep the period of detention under review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1154	It is to be noted that section 35 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1991 does not require a tariff to be fixed in any of the cases to which that subsection applies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1155	The subsection deals only with what the Secretary of State must do before he exercises his discretion to release . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1156	It does not oblige him to seek advice or to take any decisions about the period to be served at the outset , although he may of course do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1157	The tariff approach which is currently in use has its origins in a policy which was announced to Parliament by the Home Secretary , Mr Leon Brittan , on 30 November 1983 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1158	But what was contemplated in that policy statement was the seeking of an initial judicial view -- the word `` initial '' was appropriate , because the Secretary of State was still required to consult the judiciary before release from custody -- on the requirements of retribution and deterrence , in order to provide guidance to the Secretary of State as to the appropriate date for the first consideration of the case by the Parole Board . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1159	And it was made clear that it was to remain possible for the Secretary of State exceptionally to revise that view of the minimum period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1160	The use of the word `` tariff , '' which implies fixture , as in a table of fixed charges for services , has led to a development of this policy which , in the case of detainees under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 , risks replacing the duty of review with the blanket of rigidity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1161	If the matter had been allowed to rest in this case at the stage of seeking advice from the judiciary -- advice which was relevant to the Secretary of State 's function , but from which he could depart if and when he thought appropriate -- that would have been one thing and no harm would have been done . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1162	But for the Secretary of State to set his own tariff , of the kind indicated by his present policy and then to communicate his decision to the applicants -- as he was required to do by Regina v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte Doody , but which had the inevitable result of publicity -- seems to me to have had the unreasonable result of imposing a fetter on the discretion which he is required to exercise if these sentences are to be kept under review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1163	It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the tariff approach in its current form is objectionable where adult mandatory life prisoners are concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1164	The objection with which we have to deal applies only in the case of children and young persons , whose sentence is one of detention under section 53 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1933 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1165	The younger the child the more objectionable it becomes , because the factors which favour special treatment in their case grow stronger the closer they were to the minimum age of criminal responsibility when the offence was committed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1166	The tariff as applied to them fails to recognise that the welfare of the child , in the light of progress and development while in custody , may require consideration of his case by the Parole Board at an earlier date than would otherwise be indicated by the application to his case of a fixed period in respect of the penal element . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1167	The contrast between the flexibility which regard for the protection and welfare of the child requires and the rigidity of the policy indicates the reason for regarding the policy , as it was applied in this case , as unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1168	The decision The Secretary of State 's decision has been criticised on various procedural grounds , but the only ground which has any real force , in my opinion , is that he wrongly took into account in fixing his tariff of material derived from public petitions and through the media , and in this respect reached a decision which was unfair to the applicants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1169	I agree entirely with what my noble and learned friend , Lord Goff of Chieveley , has said about all the other grounds , in which , as he has said , there is no substance . 	lord hope	lord goff	NAN	1	NAN
87	1170	In my opinion one need look no further than the two decision letters in order to see that this material was irrelevant to the tariff and that it should have been left entirely out of account at this stage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1171	In the opening paragraph it was stated that the Secretary of State 's decision was on the period to be served `` to meet the requirements of retribution and deterrence -LRB- ` the tariff ' -RRB- . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1172	But in the explanation which followed it was stated that he had had regard not only to the circumstances of the offence , the recommendations from the judiciary , the representations made on behalf of the applicants and the extent to which the case could be compared with other cases , but also `` to the public concern about this case and to the need to maintain public confidence in the system of criminal justice . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1173	It seems to me that the Secretary of State has confused two quite different things in reaching his decision on this matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1174	On the one hand there is the minimum period to be fixed for retribution and deterrence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1175	That is the matter on which advice is sought in the first instance from the judiciary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1176	On the other hand there is the question whether the person should be released from custody once the tariff has been served , as a preliminary to which his case must be considered and he must then be recommended for release by the Parole Board . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1177	That is a matter which is at the discretion of the Secretary of State under section 35 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Act of 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1178	He is entitled then to decide , for policy reasons , that the case should not be referred to the Parole Board or , if the Parole Board have recommended release , that the prisoner should not be released from custody . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1179	The policy considerations to be applied at that stage are a matter for him , subject to what I have already said about his duty of review in the case of section 35 -LRB- 1 -RRB- detainees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1180	But the imposition of a tariff , which is intended to fix the minimum period to be spent in custody is , in itself , the imposition of a form of punishment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1181	This has , as Lord Mustill observed in Regina v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex parte Doody , at p. 557A-B , the characteristics of an orthodox judicial exercise , which is directed to the circumstances of the offence and those of the offender and to what , having regard to the requirements of retribution and deterrence , is the appropriate minimum period to be spent in custody . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1182	The judge , when advising the Secretary of State about the tariff , must and does confine his attention to these matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1183	He does not take account of public petitions or public opinion as expressed through the media . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1184	Expressions of opinion from these sources , however sincere and well presented , are rarely based on a full appreciation of the facts of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1185	More importantly , they can not be tested by cross-examination or by any other form of inquiry in which the prisoner for his interest can participate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1186	Natural justice requires that they be dismissed as irrelevant to the judicial exercise , as it would be unfair for the judge to allow himself to be influenced by them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1187	If the Secretary of State wishes to fix a tariff for the case -- in order to replace the views of the judiciary with a view of his own about the length of the minimum period -- he must be careful to abide by the same rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1188	He must leave out of account at this stage and for this purpose those factors which the judge would have to leave out of account in reaching a decision which was fair . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1189	It would be unfair for him to do otherwise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1190	This is not to say that those other factors may not have a part to play when the time comes for the selection of a proposed release date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1191	But circumstances may have changed by then , and the factors which at one time may have seemed important may by then have acquired a different significance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1192	The more rigid the approach to the tariff -- and the decisions which the Secretary of State took in this case in the light of his declared policy indicate a desire on his part for rigidity in order to maintain public confidence -- the more important it is that these requirements should be observed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1193	They were departed from in this case , and I regard the decisions as procedurally unreasonable on this ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1194	Conclusion The appeal was taken by the Secretary of State against the decision of the Divisional Court , which the Court of Appeal upheld , that the decision which he reached was unfair for procedural reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1195	On the single ground which I have described in the previous paragraph I would dismiss the appeal . 	lord hope	self	outcome	1	NAN
87	1196	The cross-appeals were taken by the applicants against the decision of the Court of Appeal that the Secretary of State was entitled to adopt the same policy with regard to a child detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure as in the case of an adult mandatory life prisoner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1197	For the reasons which I have given in the earlier part of this speech I would allow the cross-appeals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
87	1198	In the result I agree with both the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal that the decision must be quashed , and I would decline to grant declaratory relief on the ground that this is unnecessary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
