193	8	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord mance
193	9	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord mance
193	10	I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend , Lord Mance . 	lord hope	lord mance	ackn	0	lord mance
193	11	I agree with it , and for the reasons he gives I too would dismiss the appeal . 	lord hope	lord mance	fullagr	0	lord mance
193	11	I agree with it , and for the reasons he gives I too would dismiss the appeal . 	lord hope	self	outcome	0	lord mance
193	12	I wish to add only a few observations of my own on the first issue : was there a contract for the carriage of goods by road within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Goods by Road -LRB- `` CMR '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord mance
193	13	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord mance
193	14	The reach of article 1 of CMR is very wide . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord mance
193	15	It applies to every contract for the carriage of goods by road , provided it is a contract for reward and the place of taking over the goods and the place designated for delivery , as specified in the contract , are situated in two different countries of which at least one is a contracting country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord mance
193	16	The place of residence and the nationality of the parties are irrelevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord mance
193	17	All the qualifications as to the kind of contract that the article contemplates are met in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	18	The questions are whether , in the events that happened , the three packages that UPS 's driver uplifted from Datec 's premises in Milton Keynes for delivery to Incoparts ' agents in Amsterdam were being transported under a contract and , if so , whether it was a contract of carriage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	19	It is not disputed that , if there was a contract of carriage , CMR applies to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	20	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	21	The underlying facts point strongly towards there having been a contract between the parties of some kind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	22	UPS 's driver presented himself at Datec 's premises in response to a computer booking for the transportation of the packages to Amsterdam . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	23	This was to be done in consideration of a transportation charge for which Date was to be billed through its account with UPS . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	24	He accepted the packages and carried them by road to Luton . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	25	From there they continued on their journey by air to Cologne and then on by road to Amsterdam . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	26	The essential elements of a contract were all present . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	27	I think that the surrounding circumstances indicate that the transaction was being undertaken on both sides with reference to the framework agreement which the parties entered into on 8 March 2001 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	28	This was a standard form contract to which terms and conditions of carriage -LRB- `` the conditions '' -RRB- were attached . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	29	The problem arises , as Lord Mance has explained , because each of the three packages exceeded the limit of value set out in clause 3 -LRB- a -RRB- -LRB- ii -RRB- of the conditions . 	lord hope	lord mance	partagr	0.1	lord mance
193	30	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	31	Clause 3 of the conditions begins with these words : The conditions must , of course , be read as a whole . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	32	So the provisions which follow must be read in the light of the guidance as their purpose which is to be found in these two opening sentences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	33	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	34	Various service restrictions and conditions are set out in para -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	35	These include restrictions on the size , value and contents of packages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	36	Among these restrictions is para -LRB- a -RRB- -LRB- iv -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	37	It provides that packages must not contain goods which might endanger human or animal life or any means of transportation or which might otherwise taint or endanger other goods being transported by UPS . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	38	Para -LRB- a -RRB- also makes the shipper responsible , among other things , for the accuracy and completeness of the particulars inserted in the waybill and for ensuring that all packages set out adequate contact details for the shipper and receiver of the package . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	39	A breach of the limits set by some of the restrictions and conditions may be capable of being identified by inspection at the outset before any carriage takes place : see para -LRB- a -RRB- -LRB- i -RRB- , which relates to the weight and size of packages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	40	Others may not be discovered until something happens : see para -LRB- a -RRB- -LRB- iv -RRB- , which relates to packages which may damage other goods being transported by UPS . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	41	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	42	The consequences of a failure to meet the requirements of para -LRB- a -RRB- are set out in paras -LRB- c -RRB- , -LRB- d -RRB- and -LRB- e -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	43	If it comes to the attention of UPS that any package does not meet any of the restrictions or conditions set out in para -LRB- a -RRB- , it may suspend carriage and hold the package or shipment to the shipper 's order : para -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- i -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	44	It may also do this if , among other things , it has been given an incorrect address for delivery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	45	The shipper is responsible for the reasonable costs and expenses of UPS and for all claims against UPS because a package does not meet any of the restrictions and conditions in para -LRB- a -RRB- : para -LRB- d -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	46	UPS is not liable for any losses which the shipper may suffer arising out of UPS 's carrying packages which do not meet the restrictions and conditions set out in para -LRB- a -RRB- : para -LRB- e -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	47	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	48	The service which UPS offers is an express package and document service which is designed to handle high volumes with the minimum of delay and inconvenience to customers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	49	The commercial purpose of the framework agreement is to allocate responsibility between the parties in events which may be expected to happen in contracts of that kind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	50	Two situations are contemplated by clause 3 -LRB- c -RRB- , which is headed `` refusal and suspension of carriage '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord mance
193	51	To these a third must be added , which is this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	52	The first is where the fact that package does not meet any of the restrictions or conditions comes to the attention of the driver at the outset before it is accepted for carriage by UPS . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	53	In this situation UPS may `` refuse to transport '' the package . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	54	The second is where this fact comes to the attention of UPS after carriage has begun and while the package is still in transit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	55	In this situation UPS may `` suspend carriage '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	56	The third is where carriage has begun and the fact does not come to the attention of UPS until the package is lost or damaged before or at the point of delivery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	57	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	58	In the first situation there is no contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	59	The package does not meet the terms of UPS 's offer , so UPS is entitled not to accept it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	60	In the second and third situations , however , I do not think that it can be said that there was no contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	61	The package has been handed over and accepted , and it is being or has been carried . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	62	The conditions explain how the transaction is then to be regulated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	63	In the case of suspension , the package is held for the shipper 's order and may be returned to the shipper at the discretion of UPS : para -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- iii -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	64	In the case of suspension or where loss or damage occurs , UPS is relieved of any liability to the shipper by para -LRB- d -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	65	The fact that the conditions are designed to deal with these situations indicates that a transaction which gets this far falls within the contract of carriage and is regulated by it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	66	It is , of course , obvious that the conditions can not mean one thing when they are applied to domestic carriage and other when they are applied to carriage which is international . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	67	I would have expected UPS to have wished to take advantage of the conditions if the carriage which was being undertaken was internal to the UK . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	68	It is the disadvantage that flows from the application of CMR that lies behind the contention that there was no contract of carriage in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	69	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	70	In the result I would construe the conditions in the framework agreement in this way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	71	If UPS is made aware at the outset that a package that it is asked to carry does not meet any of the restrictions or conditions , it may refuse to accept it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	72	The framework agreement permits it to do this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	73	There is no contract of carriage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	74	But if UPS accepts the package and the undertaking to transport it is performed to any extent , there is a contract of carriage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	75	This is what the framework agreement itself contemplates , and its actions must be taken to be referable to a contract of carriage that has been made under it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	76	The consequences are those which the framework agreement sets out , as modified by CMR if the contract is one to which article 1 of CMR applies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance

193	78	LORD WALKER OF GESTINGTHORPE 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance

193	80	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	81	On the first issue in this appeal I am in full agreement with the reasoning and conclusions of my noble and learned friends Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Mance , whose opinions I have read in draft . 	lord walker	lord hope	ackn	0.2	lord mance

193	82	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	83	On the second issue -LRB- the judge 's conclusion that wilful misconduct had not been proved on the balance of probabilities -RRB- I feel real doubt whether the Court of Appeal had sufficient grounds for reversing the trial judge , who had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	84	He set out his findings fully and clearly and nothing in his judgment suggests to me that he failed to make full use of that advantage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord mance
193	85	In principle there are clear distinctions between findings of primary fact , factual inferences and the evaluation of factual matters , but in practice they often start to run into one another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	86	An appellate court should be cautious about differing from the trial judge in any of his findings , for the reasons explained by my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann in a passage in Biogen Inc v Medeva Ltd -LSB- 1997 -RSB- RPC 1 , 45 which is so well known as not to need repetition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	87	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	88	But I do not think it necessary to press my doubt to the point of dissent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	89	I too would dismiss this appeal . 	lord walker	self	outcome	0.3	lord mance
193	90	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	91	LORD MANCE 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	92	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	93	Introduction 14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	94	This appeal raises , first , a legal issue of general interest relating to the Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Goods by Road -LRB- `` CMR '' -RRB- , scheduled to the Carriage of Goods by Road Act 1965 and , secondly , a factual issue on which the courts below have differed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	95	The appellants , United Parcels Service Limited -LRB- `` UPS '' -RRB- , perform a parcels delivery service on a worldwide basis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	96	On Thursday , 25 July 2002 , the first respondents , Datec Electronics Holdings Ltd -LRB- `` Datec '' -RRB- , as consignors handed over to UPS in Milton Keynes three packages of Pentium IV computer processors , with a view to their delivery next morning to L & A Freight BV -LRB- `` L&A '' -RRB- , as agents for the second respondents , Incoparts BV -LRB- `` Incoparts '' -RRB- , in Amsterdam . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	97	The packages reached UPS 's hub -LRB- or feeder -RRB- premises in Amsterdam , but the judge , Andrew Smith J , found that they were never delivered to L&A . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	98	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	99	The issue of law arises because the packages were carried partway by road internationally . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	100	UPS took them first by road to Luton Airport , then by air to Cologne -LRB- apparently by UPS 's own cargo service -RRB- and from there by road to Amsterdam . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	101	The leg between Cologne and L&A in Amsterdam is international carriage within the potential scope of CMR . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	102	The respondents ' primary claim is that CMR applied to this leg , that UPS is liable for the loss of the packages during this leg under article 17 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and that the probable cause of loss was wilful misconduct by UPS or its agents or servants within article 29 , displacing the limitation of liability otherwise available to UPS under article 23 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of CMR . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	103	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	104	UPS rely in response on their standard terms and conditions -LRB- which I shall for convenience call `` UPS 's conditions '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	105	These were incorporated in an umbrella or framework agreement which Datec and UPS made on 8 March 2001 to regulate their frequent dealings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	106	Further , when making the computer booking for this particular consignment on 25 July 2002 , Datec had to click on a box expressly confirming acceptance of UPS 's conditions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	107	Under such conditions UPS sought to ensure that it did not carry any individual package worth more than US$ 50,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	108	The three packages each had a value well in excess of that limit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	109	Their total value was US$ 377,856 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	110	The processors were stored within them in eight smaller boxes - two boxes in one package which weighed 17kg , and three boxes in each of the other two packages which each weighed 25kg . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	111	Each box had a value of US$ 47,232 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	112	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	113	In these circumstances , UPS 's case is that that there was never any contract at all relating to the three packages or that , if there was , it was not a contract for carriage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	114	On the former analysis , UPS accept that they were bailees , but invoke exemptions in their conditions as the terms of the non-contractual bailment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	115	On the latter analysis , they maintain that there was a contractual bailment on the terms of the same exemptions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	116	The respondents deny that UPS 's standard conditions have either alleged effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	117	If that be wrong , however , they submit that nothing in UPS 's conditions exempts UPS from liability for the loss which occurred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord mance
193	118	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	119	On the issue whether CMR applied , the respondents succeeded both before the judge , Andrew Smith J : -LSB- 2005 -RSB- 1 Lloyd 's Rep 470 , and before the Court of Appeal -LRB- Brooke V-P and Sedley and Stephen Richards LJJ : -LSB- 2006 -RSB- 1 Lloyd 's Rep 279 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	120	The factual issue then arose whether the respondents had discharged the burden on them of establishing wilful misconduct under CMR . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	121	The judge held that they had not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	122	The Court of Appeal disagreed and held UPS liable for the full amount of the respondents ' loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	123	Against this decision , UPS now appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	124	I wish to express my appreciation for the quality of the written and oral submissions on both sides in what may , for its subject-matter , be regarded as an unusually difficult case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	125	I take the two broad issues in turn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	126	The contractual issue 19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	127	UPS 's conditions provide as follows : 20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	128	UPS 's Service and Tariff Guide , referred to in clause 1A of UPS 's conditions , contains further references to the $ 50,000 restriction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	129	Under the heading `` Sending and receiving shipments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	130	Declared value charge for insurance '' , the Guide mentions the facility to increase the limit of UPS 's liability by declaration , but adds that `` The value of the goods concerned should not however in any event exceed US$ 50,000 -LRB- US$ 500 in the case of jewellery other than costume jewellery -RRB- ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	131	as UPS does not offer carriage for goods with values above these amounts '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	132	A later provision headed `` Service restrictions '' reads : `` The maximum value or declared value per package is US$ 50,000 ... . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	133	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	134	A further statement headed `` Prohibited articles '' lists various articles as `` prohibited from shipment to all countries '' including `` Articles of exceptional value -LRB- e.g. works of art , antiques , precious stones , gold and silver -RRB- '' and `` Dangerous goods/Hazardous materials '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	135	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	136	There was originally common ground on the pleadings that UPS had entered into a contract for the carriage of the three packages of processors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	137	But , by amendment at the trial , UPS pleaded that under their conditions they did not offer , and so had never agreed , to carry these packages , which were accordingly not `` goods '' for the purposes of CMR . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	138	The amendment was permitted on the basis that it involved no new allegations of fact . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	139	The judge emphasised the limited ambit of the new argument -LSB- 2005 -RSB- 1 Lloyd 's Rep 470 , para 116 : 22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	140	The first issue is ultimately a short one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	141	Under section 1 of the Carriage of Goods by Road Act 1965 , the provisions of CMR have the force of law Article 1 of CMR states : Here , UPS had discretion as to the route and means -LRB- cf clause 1D of their conditions -RRB- , and they chose to perform as an international road carrier between Cologne and the final destination in Amsterdam . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	142	The $ 50,000 question apart , it is common ground that CMR would apply as between UPS and the respondents to the international road carriage which UPS was entitled , and chose , to undertake : cf Quantum Corpn Inc. v. Plane Trucking Ltd. -LSB- 2002 -RSB- EWCA Civ 350 ; -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 Lloyd 's Rep 25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	143	Whether CMR in fact applied thus depends on whether there was any `` contract for the carriage '' of these packages from Milton Keynes to Amsterdam . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	144	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	145	The umbrella agreement did not cover the despatch of particular packages - indeed it did not oblige Datec to despatch any packages at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	146	In the case of packages conforming to UPS 's conditions , a contract for carriage would come into existence either when a shipment was booked by computer or at latest when it was collected pursuant to such a booking . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	147	That some form of contract was intended by UPS 's conditions even in respect of packages not meeting UPS 's restrictions seems clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	148	The `` consequences '' of a shipper presenting non-conforming packages for carriage were stated to involve rights on the part of UPS to suspend carriage -LRB- clause 3 -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- i -RRB- and -LRB- ii -RRB- -RRB- , to retain any carriage charges paid -LRB- clause 3 -LRB- e -RRB- -RRB- and to open and inspect any package tendered to it for transportation -LRB- clauses 3 -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- i -RRB- and -LRB- ii -RRB- and -LRB- f -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	149	The conditions also include a positive obligation on the part of the shipper to be responsible for costs and expenses , for losses , taxes and customs duties suffered and for claims made against UPS because of the non-compliance -LRB- clause 3 -LRB- d -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	150	This last is an obligation which one can well envisage UPS wishing to be able enforce against a shipper - for example , in the case of dangerous goods damaging other goods or damaging the carrying vehicle itself , or in the case of goods prohibited for import , which resulted in UPS incurring a customs penalty or costs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	151	The critical question is to my mind whether the contract was for carriage subject to such rights and obligations , or was for some form of bailment capable of conversion into a contract for carriage only if UPS discovered the non-conformity and decided to proceed with , rather than suspend , the actual carriage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord mance
193	152	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	153	Short though the issue is , it is not an easy one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	154	But I have come to the conclusion that the courts below were correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	155	I would adopt the reasons given succinctly by Andrew Smith J in paras 118-119 of his judgment , when he said : 25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	156	To these reasons , I would add that the assumption behind the concluding words of clause 3 -LRB- e -RRB- is that , where carriage occurs without the non-conformity being detected or the carriage being suspended , carriage charges are without more due contractually . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	157	An argument that they are due as reward for carriage inadvertently performed under a bailment which was not for carriage seems to run into the commercial unreality which the judge had in mind in para 119 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	158	To the case of mutual ignorance which the judge postulated in the second sentence of para 119 , one may also add that many situations can be conceived in which there was room for disagreement or mistake about whether some of the restrictions applied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	159	Differences of view or mistakes could well arise as to whether articles were of `` unusual value '' or `` might ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	160	taint or damage other goods being transported by UPS '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	161	Finally , it is material to note that clause 3 regulates some situations where there is on any view a contract for carriage : cf the concluding sentence of clause 3 -LRB- a -RRB- , clause 3 -LRB- b -RRB- , clause 3 -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- ii -RRB- read with -LRB- iii -RRB- and the last words of clause 3 -LRB- e -RRB- as well as clause 3 -LRB- f -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	162	The more natural inference is , in my view , that the whole of clause 3 provides a contractual regime governing carriage of non-conforming goods . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	163	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	164	It is well to remember that , in many circumstances , particularly in cases of domestic carriage and carriage not subject to mandatory rules , this conclusion , and the first issue , would not be significant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	165	There would be no problem about UPS restricting its liability , whether or not there was a contract for carriage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	166	Whether clause 3 -LRB- e -RRB- would be sufficient to do this is a different matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	167	Mr Reeve for the respondents submitted that it would not be , because loss by failure to take due care or worse can not be regarded as loss `` arising out '' of UPS carrying non-conforming packages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	168	The word `` loss '' was not amplified by the usual phrases to embrace loss caused `` howsoever '' or by negligence , still less by employee misconduct or theft -LRB- cf Canada Steamship Lines Ltd. v . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	169	The King -LSB- 1952 -RSB- AC 192 , 208 , per Lord Morton -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	170	However , I would reserve any opinion on the correctness of Mr Reeve 's submission , at least in relation to loss or damage by negligence , in circumstances where , under clause 9.2 and apart from situations governed by Convention or mandatory national rules , UPS would not anyway be liable except for negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	171	I should mention that Mr Flaux QC representing UPS disclaimed any submission that clause 9.2 could apply if there was no contract for carriage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	172	UPS 's argument that there was no contract for carriage of the three packages was aimed solely at invoking clause 3 -LRB- e -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	173	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	174	UPS 's difficulties in relying on clause 3 , if there was a contract for carriage of the three packages , arise from the application to international carriage of the Warsaw Convention in the case of air transport and -LRB- more pertinently in this case -RRB- of CMR in the case of road transport . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	175	These Conventions regulate the liability of international carriers by air and road for loss of or damage or delay to goods in terms from which no derogation is permissible : cf in particular Chapters IV and VII of CMR . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	176	For the benefit of carriers , they also include certain exclusions and strict limits on the extent of liability -LRB- 8.33 units of account , about # 10 , per kilogram in the case of CMR : article 23 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -RRB- ; and these apply in relation to extra-contractual as well as contractual claims against the carrier , its servants and agents and others of whose services the carrier makes use : article 28 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	177	In most situations , therefore , the application of the CMR regime to the carriage of non-conforming packages would not expose UPS to unlimited exposure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	178	But the CMR exclusions and limits are not available if the claimant is able to prove wilful misconduct or its equivalent : article 29 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	179	The carrier is then exposed to unlimited liability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	180	Hence , in the present case , UPS 's concern to establish that CMR is inapplicable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	181	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	182	Exposure to unlimited liability in respect of wilful misconduct of its servants or agents is not normally a matter in respect of which a carrier can expect sympathy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	183	But a carrier is entitled to refuse to carry particular goods or to require the shipper to give an undertaking as to the nature or qualities of goods which it agrees to carry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	184	A carrier who unwittingly receives and carries goods which do not comply with stated restrictions is unlikely to be the ordinary carrier whom the drafters of CMR had in the forefront of their mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord mance
193	185	It is relevant to consider whether the fact that goods did not conform to the carrier 's restrictions retains any relevance if CMR applies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	186	There are various ways in which it might do so , some of them discussed before the judge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	187	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	188	First , if the non-conforming nature of the goods -LRB- e.g. excess weight -RRB- itself led to damage to the goods themselves , this could be relevant under article 17 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of CMR both to show that the damage occurred through circumstances which the carrier could not avoid and , quite possibly , to show that it was caused by wrongful act or neglect of the claimant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	189	In the present case , UPS advanced before the judge the more ambitious contention that the loss was caused by wrongful act or neglect of the respondents through despatching goods worth more than US$ 50,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	190	The judge at para 127 was not persuaded that the despatch of excess-value packages was a `` wrongful act '' by Datec , and he did not regard it as necessary or permissible to interpret the contract as containing an implied undertaking not to despatch such packages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	191	I have considerable doubts about this part of the judge 's reasoning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	192	But the judge also rejected UPS 's contention for the more persuasive reason that the excessive value of the packages did not in any way cause the loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	193	The packages were not , in other words , lost because of their individual value -LRB- although , as will appear , they may well have been targeted because of the value of their contents -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	194	The judge further found that , had Datec not ignored the package value restriction , it could and would in any event have despatched the contents of the packages -LRB- that is the eight boxes each having a value of less than US$ 50,000 -RRB- as separate packages via UPS . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	195	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	196	Article 41 of CMR renders null and void `` any stipulation which would directly or indirectly derogate from the provisions of this Convention '' , adding that `` the nullity of such a stipulation shall not involve the nullity of the other provisions of the contract '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	197	So far as the first part of clause 3 -LRB- e -RRB- of UPS 's conditions purports to remove liability for loss , damage or delay which UPS would otherwise incur under article 17 of CMR , clause 3 -LRB- e -RRB- is null and void . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	198	But CMR does not supersede all aspects of the contractual or legal relationship between a carrier and those contracting for the carrier 's services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	199	It is at least arguable that clause 3 -LRB- d -RRB- of UPS 's conditions would enable UPS to cross-claim , against those contracting for UPS 's services , in respect of any excess exposure over and above US$ 50,000 per package which UPS could show that they only incurred as a result of the shipment of non-conforming packages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	200	Before the House , the possibility that there might be or have been some relief based on an implied misrepresentation or misstatement of the characteristics of the packages being despatched was also raised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	201	The limited scope of the first issue -LRB- cf paragraph 21 above -RRB- means that the validity of these arguments has not been tested . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	202	But , if they are not sound , the harsh , but clear-cut position will be that , where a carrier contracts unwittingly to carry non-conforming goods and chooses to perform internationally by road , CMR applies with its benefits and burdens , and that the carrier 's restrictions will be relevant only if and in so far as they may assist the carrier to avoid liability under article 17 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	203	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	204	I would therefore reject UPS 's challenge to the application of CMR to the carriage of the three packages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance

193	207	Some further facts need stating . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	208	The three packages bore barcode labels with separate identification numbers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	209	These labels were all twice scanned at about 7.30 a.m. on Friday , 26 July 2002 shortly after the packages arrived at UPS 's hub premises in Amsterdam . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	210	The hub premises consisted of a yard surrounded by a 3 metre fence with one pedestrian and two vehicular gates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	211	Inside the yard was a large secure warehouse , with gates on one side against which incoming vehicles reversed in such a way as to make it `` virtually impossible '' for anyone to enter or leave the warehouse along either side of the vehicles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	212	Short feeder conveyors were extended into the backs of incoming vehicles , and staff called `` unloaders '' used these to discharge packages to a main conveyor belt inside the shed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	213	The barcodes were scanned first on `` import '' and then , on reaching the main conveyor belt , as `` out for delivery '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance

193	215	Packages were unloaded from the spurs either by the driver for the relevant vehicle or by `` pre-loaders '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	216	Loading was a quick operation giving very little time to assess what packages contained or their value -LRB- although Mr van Beusekom of UPS said in his written statement that a driver loading his own vehicle `` might have more of an opportunity to assess '' such matters -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	217	Loaded vans left the warehouse through roll-doors opened by `` proximity '' card . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance
193	218	The vans had automatic locks on the doors between the cabin and their rear , as well as padlocks to their rear doors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord mance

193	257	On the basis that there was non-delivery , the judge turned to consider the likelihood of theft by an employee of UPS . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mance
193	258	Mr van Beusekom 's evidence was that the hub had lost only eighteen packages due to theft between 1998 and 2002 , with `` 17 of them being lost to a crime ring that was broken in March 2001 '' , and that UPS 's security systems were sound and UPS 's approach to theft that it was always prosecuted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mance
193	259	He also said that the hub lost 41 packages in July 2002 alone , an average of around 1 in every 2712 packages handled , and gave various possible explanations as to how packages could go missing `` inexplicably '' -LRB- as the judge put it -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mance
193	260	They included delivery without any record being made , mis-delivery and theft from a van on its rounds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mance
193	261	So far as Mr van Beusekom in his witness statement expressed opinions as to what might have happened to the three packages , Mr Reeve did not cross-examine , taking the view that this was a matter for the experts called on either side -LRB- and the judge in a comment during cross-examination endorsed this approach -RRB- .

193	263	Experts were called and examined on both sides , Mr Holmes for the respondents and Mr Heinrich-Jones for UPS . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mance

193	268	Mr Holmes went on to make clear that he believed that he had said that the probable cause was theft by Mr Kadim or another UPS employee and that this was indeed both `` highly likely '' and the probable cause , although `` one can not be 100 % certain '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mance

193	271	Mr Julian Flaux QC for UPS stressed in his submissions that , based on an original list by Mr Heinrich-Jones , the experts had in a joint memorandum identified a range of 17 possibilities , grouped under four headings : -LRB- I -RRB- Misplaced , -LRB- II -RRB- Delivery Issues , -LRB- III -RRB- Labelling Issues and -LRB- IV -RRB- Theft . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mance
193	272	Two such possibilities , `` Delivered but no proof of delivery '' under head II and `` Bar code problems '' under head -LRB- III -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mance
193	273	fall out of the picture in the light of the judge 's finding that the packages were not delivered to L&A . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mance
193	274	There is nothing in Datec 's or UPS 's documentation or in the course of known events to suggest any likelihood of the remaining possibilities listed as `` Labelling Issues '' under head III , that is Incorrectly labelled , Incorrectly addressed or Over labelled . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mance
193	275	This is particularly so when -LRB- a -RRB- it would be a remarkable coincidence if three or four packages due for delivery to the same place all went astray on 26 July 2002 for such a reason , -LRB- b -RRB- all four packages were satisfactorily scanned both on import and as `` out for delivery '' at UPS 's hub on the morning of 26 July 2002 , and -LRB- c -RRB- Mr Kharbouche checked the labels on the three packages and found them visually in order just before they were due for loading on 26th July .

193	276	Two possibilities under head IV -LRB- Theft by UPS Delivery Driver and by Unknown UPS Employee -RRB- involve wilful misconduct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mance
193	277	The remaining possibilities listed under head IV were Third party theft from the hub , Theft following forcible entry , In transit theft from delivery vehicle and Theft by deception . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mance
193	278	Mr Heinrich-Jones considered that the security and operations at the hub effectively precluded the first two , that the third could not be eliminated as one of the likely causes of the loss , and that the last -LRB- in the form of deception persuading the driver to deliver the packages to unconnected third parties -RRB- was `` possible '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mance
193	279	However , as he observed , there was no DIAD signature to suggest that Mr Kadim or any other driver was innocently deceived into any such mis-delivery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mance
193	280	There was also no positive support for the possibility of theft from the delivery vehicle without the complicity of the driver . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mance
193	281	Even if one confines attention to the three packages -LRB- and the loss of the Axxis package would involve a remarkable coincidence , if due to some entirely different cause to that causing the loss of the three packages -RRB- , an untargeted , adventitious theft of three heavy packages during an unguarded moment would be unlikely .

193	282	It is far more likely , as Mr Heinrich-Jones recognised in paragraph 6.78 of his report , that any theft `` would be a clear example of theft of high value targeted items '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mance
193	283	But , if these packages were targeted , it is also highly likely that there was collaboration or information as to their movement from within UPS . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mance
193	284	Consistently with this , the judge accepted -LRB- at paragraph 59 -RRB- that `` if they were stolen , it is probable that an employee of UPS was responsible for the theft '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mance
193	285	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord mance
193	286	The judge concluded that the probable cause of loss was not theft , but was accidental , so falling within one of the three possibilities given as under head I , Misplaced -LRB- viz Missorted , Mislaid or Damaged then thrown away -RRB- or within one of the remaining two possibilities under head II , Delivery issues -LRB- viz Failed delivery , Mis-delivery or Delivered in error -RRB- .

193	288	Richards LJ gave the principal judgment in the Court of Appeal with which Brooke LJ agreed : -LSB- 2006 -RSB- 1 Lloyd 's Rep 279 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	289	Richards LJ summarised the criticisms made of the judge 's approach by Mr Reeve in his submissions as follows , at p 295 : 43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	290	At paras 67 to 76 , Richards LJ accepted the substance of Mr Reeve 's criticisms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	291	He said : 44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	292	It is right at this point to say a word about Mr Kadim 's position , although I agree with Richards LJ that it is not ultimately critical . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	293	The judge in addressing Mr Kadim 's position treated four considerations as casting `` real doubt '' on any contention that he had stolen the packages : the fact that Mr Kadim went voluntarily to the police , the fact that it was not obvious from the labelling and documentation that the packages were particularly valuable -LRB- and there was no evidence that Mr Kadim knew that they were , although it was `` possible '' that he did -RRB- , the fact that he did deliver one package to L&A on 26 July 2002 and the absence of any convincing evidence that the packages were loaded on his vehicle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	294	Richards LJ commented : I agree with Richards LJ 's comments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	295	I do not regard either Mr Kadim 's voluntary visit to the police , when he knew they were seeking to arrest him , or his delivery of one package to L&A as any particular indication of innocence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	296	Mr Kadim 's statement -LRB- quoted in paragraph 35 above -RRB- was also not that he was not on 26th July familiar with the Schiphol South East route - all that is known is that this had not been his regular route . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	297	But , as the judge said , the respondents ' case does not depend on putting the blame on any specific employee of UPS . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	298	If Mr Kadim is right in suggesting that another unscheduled UPS driver may have taken these three -LRB- or presumably all four -RRB- missing packages for delivery , the questions arise why this driver took the packages and why he never delivered them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	299	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	300	Mr Flaux for UPS submits that the Court of Appeal , in concluding that employee theft was the relevant cause , paid insufficient attention to the primacy of the judge 's findings , that it was lured into a process of elimination -LRB- which could at best arrive a conclusion as to which of many possible causes was the least unlikely , rather than a conclusion as to any cause which was more probable than all the others viewed together -RRB- and that , despite lip service to the need for clear and cogent evidence , it found wilful misconduct when there was an absence of any such evidence .

193	302	As to the correct approach in an appellate court to findings and inferences of fact made by a judge at first instance after hearing evidence , there was no disagreement between counsel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	303	In Assicurazioni Generali SpA v. Arab Insurance Group -LSB- 2003 -RSB- 1 WLR 577 , Clarke LJ summarised the position , referring also to a passage in a judgment of my own : The judgment of Ward LJ in the Assicurazioni Generali case may be read as advocating a different test , which would equate the approach of an appellate court to findings of fact with its approach to decisions taken in the exercise of a discretion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	304	As Waller LJ correctly pointed out in Manning v. Stylianou -LSB- 2006 -RSB- EWCA Civ 1655 , that is not the correct test , and it is the judgment of Clarke LJ in the paragraphs quoted above from his judgment that gives proper guidance as to the role of the Court of Appeal when faced with appeals on fact .

193	305	47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	306	In the present case , the judge 's findings of primary fact have not been challenged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	307	One or two small points have been made on factual matters , but they are of no or minor relevance and do not justify Mr Flaux 's submission that the Court of Appeal exceeded its proper role in reviewing the judge 's conclusions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	308	Essentially , what have been in issue have been the inferences with regard to the causation of loss to be drawn from primary facts which are not in dispute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	309	Mr Flaux , in my view correctly , accepted this was a correct analysis of the central issues , when opening the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	310	I note in parenthesis that Richards LJ appears to have treated as applicable the steeper appellate hurdle that would have applied if the appeal had been related to an evaluation or judgment or a decision analogous to the exercise of a discretion ; even so he arrived at the conclusion he did on the basis that the judge had in his paragraph 66 failed to take into account relevant considerations ; in particular the judge had failed to follow through the two examples he gave of accidental loss and to consider what each involved and how plausible each might be -LRB- cf paras 85 to 87 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	311	I do not disagree with Richards LJ 's latter comments , but in my view the situation is one where an appellate court is well placed and entitled to re-consider for itself the judge 's findings as to what should or should not be inferred regarding causation from the primary facts which he found . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	312	48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	313	Nor do I accept Mr Flaux 's submission that Richards LJ was lured , by a process of elimination , into accepting as the probable cause the least unlikely of a range of possibilities all of them unlikely . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	314	That was the error the House identified in the approach taken by the judge at first instance in Rhesa Shipping Co SA v. Edmunds -LRB- The `` Popi M '' -RRB- -LSB- 1985 -RSB- 1 WLR 948 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	315	The reasoning of Sedley LJ in the present case may be open to criticism both for suggesting that sufficient was known for the court to base its conclusions on the least improbable cause and for doing this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	316	But that of Richards LJ , with whom Brooke LJ agreed , is not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	317	49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	318	Richards LJ summarised his conclusions as follows : 50 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	319	I find the reasons given by Richards LJ for reversing the judge compelling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord mance
193	320	None of the possibilities mentioned by the judge in para 66 affords any plausible explanation of the disappearance of the three packages , still less of all the four that were due for delivery to L&A on 26th July 2002 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord mance
193	321	In their joint memorandum the two experts were in fact agreed that the possibilities of loss , Missorted , Mislaid and Damaged/thrown away/sold at auction , under head I were each `` less likely than others '' , in view of the sighting of the packages by Mr Karbouche correctly stacked and labelled on the spur shortly before loading . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord mance
193	322	None of these possibilities anyway offers any comprehensible explanation for the disappearance of three -LRB- or in fact four -RRB- large and valuable packages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord mance
193	323	The possibilities , Mis-delivered and Delivered in error , under head II run up , as previously stated , against the inherent implausibility of three or four separate packages due for delivery to L&A all being innocently misdelivered on the same day without any DIAD signature being obtained from anyone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord mance
193	324	The possibilities floated before the judge -LRB- but not even mentioned by him in his paragraph 66 -RRB- under head II , Labelling issues , are remote in the extreme for the reasons given in paragraph 27 above . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord mance
193	325	As to head IV , Theft , the joint memorandum categorised all the possibilities as `` less likely '' , except for those involving a UPS driver or employees , and the judge found that , if the packages were stolen , it was probably by a UPS employee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord mance
193	326	Inevitably , any systematic consideration of the possibilities is subject to a risk that it may become a process of elimination leading to no more than a conclusion regarding the least unlikely cause of loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord mance
193	327	But , as I have said , I do not consider that Richards LJ fell into that trap . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord mance
193	328	I share , without hesitation , the view which he formed overall that theft involving a UPS employee was shown on a strong balance of probability to have been the cause of this loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord mance
193	329	51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord mance
193	330	In agreement with the reasoning of the majority contained in the judgment of Richards LJ in the Court of Appeal , I would therefore dismiss this appeal . 	lord mance	self	outcome	1	lord mance
