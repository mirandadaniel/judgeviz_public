38	22	I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Scott of Foscote . 	lord millett	lord scott	ackn	0.1	lord millett, lord scott

38	24	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	25	The limitation of actions is entirely statutory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	26	The first statute was The Limitations Act 1623 -LRB- 21 Jac 1 , c 16 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	27	For almost four centuries , therefore , it has been the policy of the legislature that legal proceedings should be brought , if at all , within a prescribed period from the accrual of the cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	28	The statutes of limitation have been described as `` statutes of peace '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	29	They are regarded as beneficial enactments and are construed liberally . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	30	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	31	The underlying policy to which they give effect is that a defendant should be spared the injustice of having to face a stale claim , that is to say one with which he never expected to have to deal : see Donovan v Gwentoys Ltd -LSB- 1990 -RSB- 1 WLR 472 , 479A per Lord Griffiths . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	32	As Best CJ observed nearly 200 years ago , long dormant claims have often more of cruelty than of justice in them : see A'Court v Cross -LRB- 1825 -RRB- 3 Bing 329 , 332-333 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	33	With the passage of time cases become more difficult to try and the evidence which might have enabled the defendant to rebut the claim may no longer be available . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	34	It is in the public interest that a person with a good cause of action should pursue it within a reasonable period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	35	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	36	But this assumes that the plaintiff knows or ought to know that he has a cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	37	In common justice a plaintiff ought not to find that his action is statute-barred before he has had a reasonable opportunity to bring it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	38	To this end the Limitation Acts contain provisions which extend , suspend or postpone the commencement of the limitation period in prescribed circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	39	The particular provision with which your Lordships are concerned is contained in section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Limitation Act 1980 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	40	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	41	Section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- of the 1980 Act postpones the commencement of the limitation period where `` any fact relevant to the plaintiff 's right of action has been deliberately concealed from him by the defendant '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	42	In such a case the period of limitation does not begin to run until the plaintiff discovers the concealment or could with reasonable diligence discover it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	43	The rationale for this provision is plain : if the defendant is not sued earlier , he has only himself to blame . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	44	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	45	Section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- provides : For the purposes of subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- above , deliberate commission of a breach of duty in circumstances in which it is unlikely to be discovered for some time amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in that breach of duty . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	46	The rationale for this is less clear , but becomes apparent from the case law on earlier statutes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	47	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	48	In Brocklesby v Armitage & Guest -LRB- Note -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 WLR 598 the plaintiff claimed that the defendants , who were a firm of solicitors , had negligently failed to procure his release from his mortgage obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	49	The defendants were not accused of any impropriety or deliberate wrongdoing or of having deliberately concealed anything from the plaintiff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	50	They denied that the plaintiff was their client or that they owed him any duty of care , and denied that they had been negligent in any event . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	51	They also pleaded that the action was statute-barred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	52	In his reply the plaintiff sought to rely on section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act , but he did not and could not allege that the defendants were aware of the fact that they had been negligent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	53	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	54	Despite the absence of any allegation of deliberate wrongdoing , a two-man Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff had sufficiently pleaded a `` deliberate commission of a breach of duty '' within the meaning of section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1980 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	55	In the course of an extempore judgment Morritt LJ held that ignorance of the law is no defence , and that it is sufficient to bring the case within the subsection that the defendant should have known that he was acting -LRB- or presumably failing to act -RRB- ; it was not necessary that he should also have known that his act -LRB- or failure to act -RRB- gave rise to a breach of duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	56	It was sufficient that -LRB- at p 605G -RRB- `` the commission of the act was deliberate in the sense of being intentional and that that act or omission , as the case may be , did involve a breach of duty whether or not the actor appreciated that legal consequence . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	57	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	58	On this footing a person who sets out conscientiously to perform his duty but does so in a way which is subsequently found to have been negligent , thus constituting a breach of his duty of care , is liable to be sued without limit of time even where he denies that his conduct was negligent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	59	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	60	Brocklesby v Armitage & Guest was followed in Liverpool Roman Catholic Archdiocese Trustees Inc v Goldberg -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 1 All ER 182 , where the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had given it negligent tax advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord millett, lord scott
38	61	The defendant denied that his advice had been wrong , let alone negligently wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	62	Following the decision in the Brocklesby case , Laddie J held that it was sufficient to bring the case within section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- that the defendant had intentionally given the advice in question and that -LRB- if negligent -RRB- it amounted to a breach of duty ; it was not necessary that he should have appreciated that his advice was wrong or that he had been negligent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	63	Even if all the facts are known to a plaintiff , the judge held , the intentional commission of a breach of duty in circumstances where the breach is unlikely to be discovered for some time results in a legal fiction , namely that the facts are unknown . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	64	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	65	In the present case counsel for Mr Cave has found himself unable to support this reasoning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	66	He points out that the legal fiction , if any , is not that the facts are unknown to the plaintiff , but that they have been deliberately concealed from him by the defendant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	67	In such circumstances , however , the start of the limitation period is postponed only until the plaintiff discovers the concealment or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	68	If the relevant facts are already known to him , counsel concedes , treating them as deliberately concealed from him is of no effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	69	The start of the limitation period is not postponed even momentarily , for the facts which are deemed to be concealed from the plaintiff are at once discovered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	70	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	71	For my own part , I do not accept that all the facts were known to the plaintiff in the Goldberg case , for it did not know that the advice was wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	72	But neither did the defendant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	73	Nor will that fact be known to either party until the case is tried on the merits . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	74	The effect of Brocklesby v Armitage & Guest is to deprive a professional man , charged with having given negligent advice and who denies that his advice was wrong let alone negligent , of any effective limitation defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	75	However stale the claim , he must defend the action on the merits , for he will not have the benefit of a limitation defence unless he can show that his advice was not negligent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	76	This subverts the whole purpose of the Limitation Acts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	77	The harshness of the rule is evident . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	78	In the absence of any intentional wrongdoing on his part , it is neither just nor consistent with the policy of the Limitation Acts to expose a professional man to a claim for negligence long after he has retired from practice and has ceased to be covered by indemnity insurance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	79	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	80	The decision in the Brocklesby case has been the subject of much criticism , not least by the Law Commission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	81	In the present case a full Court of Appeal -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 WLR 581 expressed strong reservations about the decision but considered themselves bound by it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	82	They noted , at p 589 , that it was an unreserved judgment in a case in which numerous authorities both judicial and textbook were not cited : 17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	83	The question is whether the words `` deliberate commission of a breach of duty '' in section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1980 Act mean `` deliberate commission of -LSB- an act or omission , being an act or omission which gives rise to -RSB- a breach of duty '' or simply mean `` deliberate breach of duty '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	84	If the latter , then they refer only to a breach of duty which has been committed intentionally . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	85	The distinction is between intentional wrongdoing on the one hand and negligence or inadvertent wrongdoing on the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	86	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	87	In a vigorous defence of the decision in the Brocklesby case counsel for Mr Cave conducted a sustained analysis of the relationship between section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- and section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	88	He submitted that , on the defendants ' construction , section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- is otiose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	89	If it is limited to deliberate wrongdoing of which the defendant was aware but the plaintiff was not , then this must be the result of deliberate concealment which is already covered by section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	90	`` Concealment '' means `` keeping secret '' , and -LRB- he said -RRB- the pre-1980 case law showed that it covered non-disclosure as well as active concealment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	91	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	92	A defendant was formerly unable to take advantage of the Limitation Acts if he had been guilty of `` concealed fraud '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	93	This equitable doctrine was given statutory effect by section 26 -LRB- b -RRB- of the Limitation Act 1939 , which postponed the start of the limitation period where the plaintiff 's right of action had been `` concealed by the fraud of -LSB- the defendant or his agent -RSB- '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	94	This was an inapt and inelegant expression which caused much difficulty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	95	It put the emphasis on the fraud rather than the concealment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	96	Section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- and section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1980 Act were designed to clarify and , if necessary , change the law by removing all reference to fraud and substituting the more appropriate concept of `` deliberate concealment '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	97	In such circumstances reference to the antecedent statute and case law is of limited value , since there can be no assumption that the later statute merely reproduced the pre-existing law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	98	But in my opinion it can be referred to if it helps either to identify the mischief which the later statute set out to remedy or to explain why Parliament chose to adopt the particular language or drafting technique which it did when enacting the later statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	99	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	100	Lord Denning MR explained the meaning of the expression `` concealed by the fraud of -LSB- the defendant or his agent -RSB- '' in King v Victor Parsons & Co -LSB- 1973 -RSB- 1 WLR 29 , 33-34 as follows : `` The word ` fraud ' here is not used in the common law sense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord millett, lord scott
38	101	It is used in the equitable sense to denote conduct by the defendant or his agent such that it would be ` against conscience ' for him to avail himself of the lapse of time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	102	The cases show that , if a man knowingly commits a wrong -LRB- such as digging underground another man 's coal -RRB- ; or a breach of contract -LRB- such as putting in bad foundations to a house -RRB- , in such circumstances that it is unlikely to be found out for many a long day , he can not rely on the Statute of Limitations as a bar to the claim : see Bulli Coal Mining Co v Osborne -LSB- 1899 -RSB- AC 351 and Applegate v Moss -LSB- 1971 -RSB- 1 QB 406 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	103	In order to show that he ` concealed ' the right of action ` by fraud ' , it is not necessary to show that he took active steps to conceal his wrongdoing or breach of contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	104	It is sufficient that he knowingly committed it and did not tell the owner anything about it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	105	He did the wrong or committed the breach secretly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	106	By saying nothing he keeps it secret . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	107	He conceals the right of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	108	He conceals it by ` fraud ' as those words have been interpreted in the cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	109	To this word ` knowingly ' there must be added recklessly ' : see Beaman v ARTS Ltd -LSB- 1949 -RSB- 1 KB 550 , 565-566 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	110	Like the man who turns a blind eye . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	111	He is aware that what he is doing may well be a wrong , or a breach of contract , but he takes the risk of it being so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	112	He refrains from further inquiry least it should prove to be correct : and says nothing about it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	113	The court will not allow him to get away with conduct of that kind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	114	It may be that he has no dishonest motive : but that does not matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	115	He has kept the plaintiff out of the knowledge of his right of action : and that is enough : see Kitchen v Royal Air Force Association -LSB- 1958 -RSB- 1 WLR 563 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	116	If the defendant was , however , quite unaware that he was committing a wrong or a breach of contract , it would be different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	117	So if by an honest blunder he unwittingly commits a wrong -LRB- by digging another man 's coal -RRB- , or a breach of contract -LRB- by putting in an insufficient foundation -RRB- then he could avail himself of the Statute of Limitations '' -LRB- emphasis added -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	118	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	119	Concealment and non-disclosure are different concepts , but they have this much in common ; they both require knowledge of the fact which is to be kept secret . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	120	A man can not sensibly be said either to conceal or to fail to disclose something of which he is ignorant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	121	In King v Victor Parsons & Co the Court of Appeal unanimously held that section 26 -LRB- b -RRB- of the 1939 Act did not extend to the case where the defendant ought to have known but did not in fact know the relevant facts which constituted the cause of action against him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	122	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	123	In Beaman v ARTS Ltd -LSB- 1949 -RSB- 1 KB 550 active concealment was not alleged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	124	But the defendants were guilty of conversion , an intentional tort , and had failed to inform the plaintiff of what they had done . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	125	Quoting , at pp 559-560 , from the judgment of Lord James of Hereford in Bulli Coal Mining Co v Osborne -LSB- 1899 -RSB- AC 351 363-364 the Court of Appeal held that active concealment was not necessary if the defendant was accused of intentional wrongdoing in circumstances where he could `` safely calculate on not being found out for many a long day . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	126	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	127	As I have explained , in enacting the 1980 Act Parliament substituted `` deliberate concealment '' for `` concealed fraud '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	128	This is a different and more appropriate concept . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	129	It can not be assumed that the law remained the same . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	130	But reference to the old law explains why Parliament enacted section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and did not rely on section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- alone to cover the whole ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	131	With all reference to fraud or conscious impropriety omitted , there was an obvious risk that `` deliberate concealment '' might be construed in its natural sense as meaning `` active concealment '' and not as embracing mere non-disclosure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	132	Section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- was therefore enacted to cover cases where active concealment should not be required . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	133	But such cases were limited in two respects : first , the defendant must have been guilty of a deliberate commission of a breach of duty ; and secondly , the circumstances must make it unlikely that the breach of duty will be discovered for some time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	134	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	135	Given that section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- is -LRB- or at least may be -RRB- required to cover cases of non-disclosure rather than active concealment , the reason for limiting it to the deliberate commission of a breach of duty becomes clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	136	It is only where the defendant is aware of his own deliberate wrongdoing that it is appropriate to penalise him for failing to disclose it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	137	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	138	In my opinion , section 32 deprives a defendant of a limitation defence in two situations : -LRB- i -RRB- where he takes active steps to conceal his own breach of duty after he has become aware of it ; and -LRB- ii -RRB- where he is guilty of deliberate wrongdoing and conceals or fails to disclose it in circumstances where it is unlikely to be discovered for some time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	139	But it does not deprive a defendant of a limitation defence where he is charged with negligence if , being unaware of his error or that he has failed to take proper care , there has been nothing for him to disclose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	140	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord millett, lord scott
38	141	That this is the meaning of section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- is supported by the text . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	142	In the first place , the subsection itself distinguishes between the breach of duty and the facts involved in the breach of duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	143	In the second place , where a defendant is charged with negligence , his breach of duty consists of his failure to take reasonable care . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	144	The tax adviser who inadvertently fails to take account of a provision in the latest Finance Act may well incur liability for negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	145	But his breach of duty does not consist of giving the advice -LRB- which is deliberate and of which he is aware -RRB- or even of giving erroneous advice -LRB- which is not deliberate and of which he is unaware -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	146	It consists of his failure to take reasonable care , which is unlikely to be deliberate and of which he is unlikely to be aware . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	147	If he afterwards discovers the error and deliberately conceals it from the plaintiff , his conduct may come within section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- ; but while he remains ignorant of the error and of his own inadvertent breach of duty , there is nothing for him to disclose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	148	In my opinion such conduct can not be brought within section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	149	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	150	A further consideration is even more telling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	151	There is no rational justification for depriving a defendant of a limitation defence where neither his original wrongdoing nor his failure to disclose it to the plaintiff was deliberate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	152	If Brocklesby v Armitage & Guest -LRB- Note -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 WLR 598 is correct , then a surgeon who negligently leaves a swab in a patient 's stomach but does not realise that he has done so can plead a limitation defence ; but a solicitor who gives his client negligent advice can not plead such a defence because he knows what advice he has given , even though he does not realise that it was wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	153	There is no sensible basis for such a distinction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	154	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	155	Another example will illustrate the anomalies to which the reasoning in the Brocklesby case gives rise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	156	Take the case of the anaesthetist who negligently administers the wrong drug , with consequent harm to his patient . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	157	The anaesthetist 's selection of the wrong drug may be variously explained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	158	He may have administered the drug deliberately , knowing perfectly well what drug he was administering and intending to administer it , but having negligently overlooked the fact that in the particular circumstances of the case it was dangerous to use it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	159	Or he may simply have picked up the wrong bottle , and negligently but inadvertently administered one drug when he intended to administer another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	160	There can be no rational justification for distinguishing between the two cases by allowing the anaesthetist in the second case a limitation defence which is denied to the anaesthetist in the first . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	161	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	162	The Court of Appeal justified the construction which it placed upon section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- in the Brocklesby case by reference to the maxim that ignorance of the law is no defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	163	But the defendant solicitors in that case were not relying on their ignorance of the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	164	The negligent solicitor or tax adviser is well aware that he is subject to a duty of care and generally does not deny it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	165	In the Brocklesby case itself the defendants denied that the plaintiff was their client ; but they did not deny that , if he was , they owed him a duty of care . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	166	In cases of professional negligence the defendant is normally aware of his legal duty to take care but unaware of the fact that he has broken it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	167	Of course , if he is giving legal advice he may have failed in his duty of care because he inadvertently overlooked the existence of a particular legal rule , but the fact that he has done so or otherwise misstated the law is as much a fact as any other , of which he may be or become aware or remain ignorant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	168	The maxim that ignorance of the law is no defence does not operate to convert a lawyer 's inadvertent want of care into an intentional tort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	169	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	170	In agreement with my noble and learned friend Lord Scott of Foscote , I too would allow the appeal . 	lord millett	lord scott	fullagr	0.4	lord millett, lord scott

38	171	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	172	LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	173	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	174	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	175	This appeal comes to your Lordships ' House on a preliminary point in a solicitors ' negligence action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	176	The point is whether the claim is barred by the Limitation Act 1980 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	177	The cause of action sued on accrued in March 1989 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	178	The action was not commenced until 16 January 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	179	So unless the claimant is able to rely on one or other of the provisions of the 1980 Act extending time or postponing the running of time , his action is time-barred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	180	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord millett, lord scott
38	181	In his pleading the claimant put forward three grounds on which , he contended , his time for commencing the action was extended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	182	For reasons that I will explain later , two of these do not raise issues that are live before your Lordships . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	183	It is the third ground that raises the issue your Lordships must decide . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	184	The issue is whether the claimant can take advantage of section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1980 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	185	The Court of Appeal , expressing some disquiet but regarding themselves as bound by the exposition of the meaning and effect of section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- given by Morritt LJ -LRB- as he then was -RRB- in Brocklesby v Armitage & Guest -LRB- Note -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 WLR 598 , found in favour of the claimant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	186	This appeal is , therefore , in effect an appeal against the construction of section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- adopted in Brocklesby . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	187	The facts 33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	188	The essential facts of the present case that are relevant to the section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- issue can be shortly stated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	189	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	190	The claimant , Mr Cave , the respondent in this House , instructed a firm of solicitors , Robinson Jarvis & Rolf , the appellants , to act for him in connection with a transaction under which a company , Hyde Securities Ltd , was to grant him mooring rights for a period of 100 years over land of the company at Fishbourne , Isle of Wight . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	191	A Mr Clarke of Robinson Jarvis & Rolf acted for Mr Cave in the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	192	Mr Clarke drafted , or approved the drafting of , the document by which the mooring rights were to be granted and the transaction was completed in March 1989 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	193	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	194	In January 1994 receivers of the company were appointed by the company 's bank and in early February 1994 the receivers informed Mr Cave that his moorings rights were no longer exercisable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	195	For a while Mr Cave did nothing about the information he had received but in November 1995 he wrote to Mr Clarke . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	196	Your Lordships have not seen the letter but , presumably , Mr Cave complained that the mooring rights he thought he had been granted were being challenged and asked for Mr Clarke 's assistance in resisting the challenge or for an explanation as to what had gone wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	197	Mr Cave received no answer to his letter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	198	He wrote again on a number of occasions in 1996 but still did not receive any answer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	199	He eventually consulted other solicitors and his writ claiming damages in negligence from the appellants was issued on 16 January 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	200	The pleadings 36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	201	Mr Cave 's main pleaded complaints of negligence are , first , that the document drafted or approved by Mr Clarke granted him merely contractual rights instead of rights that would be enforceable both against the company and against its successors in title , and , secondly , that Mr Clarke failed to protect the rights by registration in the Land Registry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	202	He also pleaded in his statement of claim , in reliance on section 14A of the 1980 Act , that he had not had the knowledge required for bringing his action until March 1996 when he received a letter from the Tunbridge Wells District Land Registry informing him that there was no entry on the register relating to his mooring rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	203	He contended that he had therefore had three years from March 1996 within which to bring his action -LRB- see section 14A -LRB- 4 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	204	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	205	The solicitors , in their defence , denied negligence but pleaded also that the action was time-barred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	206	As to the section 14A point , they contended that , even if section 14A -LRB- 4 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- did apply , the three year limitation period would have run from February 1994 , when Mr Cave had been told that his mooring rights were no longer exercisable , and would , therefore , have expired before the action had been commenced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	207	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	208	Mr Cave served a reply that , in its re-amended form , took two section 32 points . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	209	It was alleged , first , that the solicitors ' failure to answer Mr Cave 's letters in 1995 and 1996 constituted `` deliberate concealment '' for the purposes of section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	210	The second point was the section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	211	The reply alleged : `` 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	212	A Further , the negligent drafting by the defendant of an agreement which did not confer on the claimant the rights which it ought to have conferred was -LRB- i -RRB- an intentional act -LRB- although , for the avoidance of doubt , it is not alleged that it was done in the knowledge that it was a breach of duty -RRB- ; and -LRB- ii -RRB- done in circumstances in which the breach of duty was unlikely to be discovered for some time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	213	In the premises , pursuant to section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Limitation Act 1980 , time did not begin to run until the claimant discovered or could with the exercise of reasonable diligence have discovered the breach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	214	Even on the defendant 's case , that date was not before February 1994 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	215	Accordingly the proceedings were issued within the primary limitation period . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	216	Paragraph 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	217	A raises the Brocklesby point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	218	The Brocklesby point 39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	219	Section 32 of the Act provides , so far as relevant : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	220	where in the case of any action for which a period of limitation is prescribed by this Act , either -- -LRB- a -RRB- the action is based upon the fraud of the defendant ; or -LRB- b -RRB- any fact relevant to the plaintiff 's right of action has been deliberately concealed from him by the defendant ; or -LRB- c -RRB- the action is for relief from the consequences of a mistake ; the period of limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff has discovered the fraud , concealment or mistake -LRB- as the case may be -RRB- or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it .

38	221	... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord millett, lord scott
38	222	-LRB- 2 -RRB- For the purposes of subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- above , deliberate commission of a breach of duty in circumstances in which it is unlikely to be discovered for some time amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in that breach of duty .

38	223	... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	224	-LRB- 5 -RRB- Sections 14A and 14B of this Act shall not apply to any action to which subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- above applies -LRB- and accordingly the period of limitation referred to in that sub-section , in any case to which either of those sections would otherwise apply , is the period applicable under section 2 of this Act -RRB- . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	225	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	226	The statutory predecessor of section 32 of the 1980 Act was -LRB- via section 7 of the Limitation Amendment Act 1980 -RRB- section 26 of the Limitation Act 1939 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	227	The wording of section 26 was not the same as the wording of section 32 and , in particular , section 26 had no provision comparable to section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	228	Nonetheless it was generally believed that the broad effect of section 26 had been continued under section 32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	229	Paragraph 31-19 of Clerk & Lindsell on Torts , 17th ed -LRB- 1995 -RRB- , p 1593 -LRB- 18th ed -LRB- 2000 -RRB- , para 33-25 , p 1723 -RRB- said that section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- `` preserves and confirms the case law on section 26 of the Limitation Act 1939 , according to which the start of the limitation period is postponed whenever the defendant has committed the wrong , knowingly or recklessly , in circumstances such as to prevent the plaintiff coming to know of his cause of action '' -LRB- cited by Janet O'Sullivan in her article `` Intentional acts , breaches of duty and the Limitation Act - a warning for negligent professionals '' -LSB- 2000 -RSB- Professional Negligence 241 , 242 , n 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	230	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	231	The case law on section 26 of the 1939 Act had established that a merely negligent act was insufficient to enable the benefit of the section to be claimed : see , for example , Kitchen v Royal Air Force Association -LSB- 1958 -RSB- 1 WLR 563 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	232	In King v Victor Parsons & Co -LSB- 1973 -RSB- 1 WLR 29 , Lord Denning MR emphasised that if the benefit of section 26 was to be available there must be something more than mere negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	233	He said , at p 34 : `` So if by an honest blunder he unwittingly commits a wrong -LRB- by digging another man 's coal -RRB- , or a breach of contract -LRB- by putting in an insufficient foundation -RRB- then he could avail himself of the Statute of Limitations '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	234	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	235	It is clear , therefore , that , under the pre 1980 law , a pleading on the lines of paragraph 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	236	A of the re-amended reply would have been unsustainable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	237	The pleader would have had to have alleged something more than an intentional but negligent act or omission in order to claim the benefit of section 26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	238	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	239	The approach to construction of section 32 was considered by this House in Sheldon v R H M Outhwaite -LRB- Underwriting Agencies -RRB- Ltd -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 102 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	240	The case was concerned not with section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- but with section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	241	Deliberate concealment of relevant facts -LRB- see section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- -RRB- had been relied on by the plaintiffs in their pleaded reply to the defendants ' Limitation Act defence and was based on acts or omissions by the defendants which had taken place after the date on which the plaintiffs ' cause of action had accrued . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	242	The question was whether the deliberate concealment merely suspended the running of time for Limitation Act purposes until the date when the plaintiffs could reasonably have discovered the relevant facts or whether a complete new limitation period , three years or six years as the case might be , would start afresh from that date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	243	This is not a point which arises in the present case , nor did it arise in Brocklesby , but it is the guidance given by the House to the approach to construction of section 32 that is in point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	244	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	245	Lord Browne-Wilkinson , noting that the 1980 Act was a consolidating Act , said , at p 144 , that : `` unless there is an ambiguity , it is not permissible to construe consolidating Acts in the light of their statutory history '' and that `` much of the difficulty in this case is raised by the investigation of the statutory history and the decisions of the courts on earlier statutes '' He held , at p 145 , that : `` Section 32 of the Act of 1980 is not ambiguous . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	246	On the plain meaning of the words any deliberate concealment of relevant facts falls within section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- with the consequence that , in applying the statutory time limits , time does not begin to run until the concealment is discovered . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	247	Lord Keith of Kinkel expressed himself in much the same terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	248	He said , at p 140 , that : `` Recourse to the antecedents of a consolidation statute should only be had where there is a real difficulty or ambiguity incapable of being resolved by classical methods of construction : Farrell v Alexander -LSB- 1977 -RSB- AC 59 , 73 , per Lord Wilberforce . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott

38	250	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	251	Lord Lloyd of Berwick , however , with whose opinion Lord Mustill , at p 146 , agreed , thought that `` Parliament has left a gap '' and that in order to try to fill the gap recourse to the history of the legislation was necessary and , therefore , legitimate : see at pp 146D and 151H-152A . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	252	Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead , too , at p 153E-F , discerned an ambiguity in section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- but he joined Lord Keith and Lord Browne-Wilkinson in the result . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	253	46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	254	The importance of Sheldon for present purposes is that it insists that if the language of section 32 is clear , effect must be given to that language without regard to the section 's legislative history . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	255	This was the point taken up in Brocklesby . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	256	47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	257	For the purpose of establishing an important point of principle on the construction and effect of section 32 , Brocklesby is , in my opinion , a very unsatisfactory vehicle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	258	It was an interlocutory appeal on a pleading point , and heard by a two-man Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	259	The case was completed within the day and one extempore judgment , by Morritt LJ , was delivered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	260	The issue in the case was whether sufficient particulars of a pleaded allegation of deliberate concealment had been given . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	261	The case was , like the present , a solicitors ' negligence case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord millett, lord scott
38	262	The transaction in respect of which it was alleged that the solicitors had been negligent was a conveyancing transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott
38	263	In January 1989 a company in which Mr Brocklesby held a minority interest had sold some commercial premises to him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott

38	274	His action was commenced in June 1997 , more than six years after his cause of action had accrued . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott
38	275	The solicitors pleaded in their defence that the action was time-barred and applied to strike it out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott
38	276	Mr Brocklesby served a reply in which it was pleaded that the solicitors ' breaches of duty had been deliberately committed in circumstances in which they had been unlikely to be discovered and had not in fact been discovered until mid-1982 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott
38	277	Such particulars as were given relating to these allegations indicated that Mr Brocklesby 's case was that the solicitors had known that the re-sale to the company would not be completed but had failed to inform him of this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott

38	279	Morritt LJ -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 WLR 598 , 602 summarised Mr Brocklesby 's case thus : `` Mr Brocklesby relies on paragraph -LRB- b -RRB- of section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LSB- of the 1980 Act -RSB- as expanded by subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott
38	280	He contends that there were three breaches of duty , that is the failure to take steps to procure Mr Brocklesby 's release from the obligations to the building society ; the failure to do anything with the executed contract/transfer ; and the failure to inform Mr Brocklesby of either of the first or second breaches of duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott
38	281	He suggests that each of them was deliberate in the sense of being intentional and each was committed in circumstances where , by their nature , they were unlikely to be discovered for some time . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott

38	283	After referring to Sheldon v R H M Outhwaite -LRB- Underwriting Agencies -RRB- Ltd -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 102 and King v Victor Parsons & Co -LSB- 1973 -RSB- 1 WLR 29 and to paragraph 2.9 of the Law Reform Committee 's Final Report on Limitation of Actions -LRB- 1977 -RRB- -LRB- Cmnd 6923 -RRB- that had preceded the 1980 Act , Morritt LJ expressed his conclusions in the following passage , at p 605 : `` When one turns to the terms of section 32 -LSB- of the 1980 Act -RSB- itself , under subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- there is a clear contrast between the action based on fraud and paragraph -LRB- b -RRB- , the concealment of any fact relevant to the plaintiff 's right of action being deliberate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott
38	284	The requirement is that the fact relevant to the cause of action has been deliberately concealed from him by the defendant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott
38	285	But subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- amplifies what is meant by deliberate concealment and requires that for the purposes of subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- deliberate commission of a breach of duty , etc , amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in the breach of duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott
38	286	Generally speaking , and I do not say that there may not be exceptions , the civil law , and , so far as I know , the criminal law , does not require that a person should know the legal consequences of the act which he commits . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott
38	287	Generally speaking , if he knows of the act and he intends the act , but is unaware of the legal consequences , his unawareness is immaterial , for it is trite law that ignorance of the law is no defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott
38	288	It appears to me that had Parliament intended in the case of a deliberate concealment under section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- -LSB- of the 1980 Act -RSB- , as amplified by subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- , that there should be both deliberate commission of an act in the sense of knowingly and intentionally committing the act and also knowledge that such commission gave rise to a particular legal consequence , then it required clearer words to spell that out than are to be found in subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- or subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott
38	289	Accordingly , the conclusion I reach is that it is not necessary for the purpose of extending the limitation period pursuant to section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- to demonstrate that the fact relevant to the plaintiff 's right of action has been deliberately concealed in any sense greater than that the commission of the act was deliberate in the sense of being intentional and that that act or omission , as the case may be , did involve a breach of duty whether or not the actor appreciated that legal consequence . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott
38	290	50 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott
38	291	The result of this interpretation of section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- is that whenever there is an intentional act which constitutes , whether or not to the knowledge of the actor , a breach of duty in circumstances in which it , i e , the breach of duty , is unlikely to be discovered for some time , sub-section -LRB- 2 -RRB- comes into play . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott
38	292	This interpretation reversed what previously had been believed to be the position , namely that mere negligence would never by itself be enough to bring about a section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- postponement of time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott
38	293	51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott
38	294	Basing himself on the view of section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- that I have described , Morritt LJ concluded that the pleaded particulars of Mr Brocklesby 's case were sufficient to sustain his cause of action against the Limitation Act defence and to resist the strike out application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott
38	295	52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott
38	296	It is worth noting , however , that the Lord Justice then went on to give an alternative , uncontroversial and , if I may respectfully say so , plainly sound reason for coming to the same conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott
38	297	He said , at p 606 : `` in addition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott

38	301	Discovery of documents has not yet taken place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord millett, lord scott
38	302	Most of the relevant facts were inevitably in the knowledge of the solicitors rather than Mr Brocklesby . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	303	There was no imminent trial such that an insufficiently particularised pleading might be embarrassing.It may be that in the light of what is disclosed on discovery he will be able to supplement the particulars already given but without such supplementation I do not consider that his case as pleaded is so thin that the court is justified in , in effect , striking it out .

38	307	The defendant , Mr David Goldberg QC , a well-known specialist in tax law , had given certain tax advice to the archdiocese . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	308	The archdiocese contended that the advice was wrong , had been negligently given and had caused the archdiocese financial loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	309	A negligence action was commenced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	310	The problem was that the allegedly negligent advice had been given in 1989 and 1992 but the action was not commenced until 1997 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	311	Mr Goldberg pleaded that an action in respect of his 1989 advice was time barred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	312	The archdiocese , in answer , sought to rely on the Brocklesby interpretation of section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	313	They proposed to amend their pleading so as to allege , inter alia : '' -LRB- a -RRB- The acts and omissions pleaded in paragraph 14 of the statement of claim -LSB- ie in relation to the 1989 advice -RSB- constituted the deliberate commission of breach of duty within the meaning of section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act in that they were intentional .

38	314	For the avoidance of doubt it is not alleged that the defendant knew that he was thereby committing a breach of duty . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	315	54 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott

38	317	A -LRB- i -RRB- of the re-amended reply in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	318	This pleading might now , I suppose , be called the Brocklesby disclaimer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	319	Laddie J applied , as he had to , the interpretation of section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- adopted in Brocklesby . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	320	He said , in paragraph 22 of his judgment , at pp 190-191 : '' ` deliberate commission of a breach of duty ' should be read consistently with the Brocklesby case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	321	Any intentional act which amounts to a breach of duty amounts to a deliberate commission of a breach of duty and triggers section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1980 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	322	The fact that in the proposed amendment to the reply , the archdiocese concedes that Mr Goldberg did not know he was committing a breach of duty does not , therefore , exclude operation of the section . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	323	Mr Goldberg 's advice was given intentionally . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	324	On the assumption , which I have to make for the purpose of this application , namely that it amounted to a breach of duty , that breach was committed deliberately within the meaning of the section . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	325	The present case : Newman J 55 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	326	In the present case Newman J at first instance , applying Brocklesby and concluding on the facts that the solicitors ' assumed breach of duty would have been unlikely to have been discovered for some time , held that section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- applied and that the six-year limitation period did not begin to run until , at earliest , February 1994 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	327	So the action was commenced well within the six-year period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	328	56 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	329	The judge held , also , that the three-year period prescribed by section 14A would have started to run from February 1994 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	330	It followed that Mr Cave was unable to rely on section 14A as a ground for resisting the solicitors ' Limitation Act defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	331	Mr Cave did not appeal against this finding . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	332	The Court of Appeal 57 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	333	The bulk of the argument in the Court of Appeal -LRB- Potter , Sedley and Jonathan Parker LJJ -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 WLR 581 appears to have centred on the question whether the court was bound by the decision of the two-man Court of Appeal in Brocklesby . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	334	They held that they were . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	335	That being so , the decision to dismiss the solicitors ' appeal was inevitable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	336	Jonathan Parker LJ , however , confessed to being uneasy about the decision in Brocklesby . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	337	He noted that in Sheldon both Lord Browne-Wilkinson and Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead had regarded unconscionability and impropriety as the `` underlying rationale '' of section 32 -LRB- see eg -LSB- 1996 -RSB- 1 AC at 145H -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	338	`` Yet '' , observed Jonathan Parker LJ , `` if Brocklesby is right , a wholly innocent act or omission may suffice to deprive a defendant of a limitation defence '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	339	That this may be so is demonstrated by the Goldberg case and , indeed , also the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	340	Was the Brocklesby construction of section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- correct ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	341	58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord millett, lord scott
38	342	In my opinion it was not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	343	I would start by adopting the approach prescribed by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in Sheldon . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	344	Unless there is some ambiguity in the statutory language , recourse to legislative history is unnecessary and impermissible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	345	The relevant words in section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- are `` deliberate commission of a breach of duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	346	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	347	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	348	amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in that breach of duty . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	349	These are clear words of English . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	350	`` Deliberate commission of a breach of duty '' is to be contrasted with a commission of a breach of duty which is not deliberate , i e , a breach of duty which is inadvertent , accidental , unintended - there is a number of adjectives that can be chosen for the purpose of the contrast , and it does not matter which is chosen . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	351	Each would exclude a breach of duty that the actor was not aware he was committing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	352	59 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	353	Mr Doctor QC , counsel for Mr Cave , the respondent , submitted that in order for a fact to be `` deliberately concealed '' for subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- purposes , the concealment must be an intended concealment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	354	I would respectfully agree with that . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	355	He followed with the submission that in every case in which there was a deliberate commission of a breach of duty in circumstances in which the victim was unlikely to discover for some time that there had been a breach , there must have been a deliberate concealment for subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	356	In which case , he concluded , subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- would add nothing to subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	357	But Parliament must have intended subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- to add something of significance to subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- and the Brocklesby interpretation does add something to subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	358	60 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	359	I hope I have done justice to the argument but , in my opinion , it can not be accepted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	360	I find it easy to accept that Mr Doctor 's submissions as to the meaning of section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- are correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	361	I agree that deliberate concealment for section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- purposes may be brought about by an act or an omission and that , in either case , the result of the act or omission , i e , the concealment , must be an intended result . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	362	But I do not agree that that renders subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- otiose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	363	A claimant who proposes to invoke section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- in order to defeat a Limitation Act defence must prove the facts necessary to bring the case within the paragraph . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	364	He can do so if he can show that some fact relevant to his right of action has been concealed from him either by a positive act of concealment or by a withholding of relevant information , but , in either case , with the intention of concealing the fact or facts in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	365	In many cases the requisite proof of intention might be quite difficult to provide . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	366	The standard of proof would be the usual balance of probabilities standard and inferences could of course be drawn from suitable primary facts but , nonetheless , proof of intention , particularly where an omission rather than a positive act is relied on , is often very difficult . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	367	Subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- , however , provides an alternative route . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	368	The claimant need not concentrate on the allegedly concealed facts but can instead concentrate on the commission of the breach of duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	369	If the claimant can show that the defendant knew he was committing a breach of duty , or intended to commit the breach of duty - I can discern no difference between the two formulations ; each would constitute , in my opinion , a deliberate commission of the breach - then , if the circumstances are such that the claimant is unlikely to discover for some time that the breach of duty has been committed , the facts involved in the breach are taken to have been deliberately concealed for subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	370	I do not agree with Mr Doctor that the subsection , thus construed , adds nothing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	371	It provides an alternative , and in some cases what may well be an easier , means of establishing the facts necessary to bring the case within section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	372	61 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	373	Morritt LJ said , in a passage I have cited , that in general a person is assumed to know the legal consequences of his actions and that , therefore , if an act has been done intentionally , the actor 's unawareness of its legal consequences would be immaterial and no defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	374	The premise is , in my opinion , much too wide to constitute a satisfactory approach to construction of a statutory provision such as section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	375	A person may or may not know that an act of his or an omission to do or say something or other constitutes a breach of tortious or contractual duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	376	His knowledge or lack of it may well be immaterial to the question whether a cause of action for which he is liable has accrued to the person injured by the act or omission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	377	But that is no reason at all why Parliament , in prescribing the circumstances in which the person injured by the act or omission can escape from a Limitation Act defence , should not distinguish between the case where the actor knows he is committing a breach of duty and the case where he does not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	378	The clear words of section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -- `` deliberate commission of a breach of duty '' -- show that Parliament has made that distinction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	379	62 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	380	It follows that , in my opinion , the construction of section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- adopted in Brocklesby was wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	381	I wish to make clear that I do not think the case was wrongly decided . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord millett, lord scott
38	382	As I have already said , Morritt LJ 's alternative ground for reaching the same decision seems to me to have been sound . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord scott
38	383	63 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord scott
38	384	I do , however , think that the Goldberg case was wrongly decided . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord scott
38	385	The Brocklesby disclaimer required , in my opinion , the conclusion that section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- could not apply and that the archdiocese 's claim in respect of the 1989 advice was time-barred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord scott
38	386	64 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord scott
38	387	There is one further point I want to make on the construction of section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- and section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord scott
38	388	Mr Davidson QC , counsel for the appellants , submitted that some degree of unconscionability in the conduct of a defendant was necessary before the defendant could be deprived under section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- , with or without the help of section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , of a Limitation Act defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord scott
38	389	This was , I think , based mainly on Lord Browne-Wilkinson 's comment in Sheldon that `` unconscionable behaviour by deliberately concealing the facts relevant to the plaintiffs ' cause of action '' was `` the underlying rationale '' of section 32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord scott
38	390	65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord scott
38	391	I respectfully agree that it is difficult to think of a case of deliberate concealment for section 32 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- purposes that would not involve unconscionable behaviour and that most cases of deliberate commission of breach of duty for section 32 -LRB- 2 -RRB- purposes would be in the same state . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord scott
38	392	But the statutory language does not require that the behaviour of the defendant be unconscionable and its addition as a criterion to be satisfied before a case can be brought within section 32 is , in my opinion , unnecessary and unjustified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord scott
38	393	The plain words of the statutory requirements , `` deliberately concealed '' and `` deliberate commission of a breach of duty '' need no embellishment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord scott
38	394	The authority of the Brocklesby decision 66 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord scott
38	395	Your Lordships have not heard any argument on the question whether the Court of Appeal in the present case was correct to hold itself bound by the Brocklesby decision and I do not wish to express any view on that issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord scott
38	396	The result 67 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord scott
38	397	In the present case the Brocklesby disclaimer in paragraph 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord scott
38	398	A of the re-amended reply means that that paragraph of the reply can not succeed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord scott
38	399	Mr Cave still has , however , his paragraph 3 point and , under a conditional compromise agreed between the parties after the Court of Appeal judgments but before the hearing in this House , Mr Cave is entitled to recover an agreed sum from the respondent solicitors , albeit less than the agreed sum he would have been entitled to recover had your Lordships upheld the Brocklesby construction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord millett, lord scott
