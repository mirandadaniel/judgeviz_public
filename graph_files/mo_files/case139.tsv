139	19	LORD HOFFMANN 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
139	20	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
139	21	By section 64 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Employment Protection -LRB- Consolidation -RRB- Act 1978 the right not to be unfairly dismissed does not apply to a dismissal which takes place after less than two years ' employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
139	22	The Act originally specified a period of one year but the Secretary of State has power under section 149 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- to vary this period by order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
139	23	The Unfair dismissal -LRB- Variation of Qualifying Period -RRB- Order 1985 -LRB- S.I. 1985 No. 782 -RRB- -LRB- `` the Order '' -RRB- extended it to two years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
139	24	In 1991 Ms Seymour-Smith and Ms Perez -LRB- `` the employees '' -RRB- were each dismissed by their respective employers after more than one but less than two years ' employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
139	25	They complain that a two year qualifying period indirectly discriminates against women because in practice they find it more difficult to qualify than men . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
139	26	In judicial review proceedings against the Secretary of State , they sought to have the Order quashed on the ground that it was contrary to article 5 of Council Directive 76/207/E.E.C . , generally known as the Equal Treatment Directive -LRB- `` the Directive '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
139	27	The Divisional court , after examining substantial statistical and other evidence , concluded that the Order had not been shown to be discriminatory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
139	28	In any case , they would not have been willing to quash it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
139	29	The Court of Appeal took a different view of the merits and held that the Order was discriminatory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
139	30	It agreed that it should not be quashed but made a declaration that , as at the date of the employees ' dismissals , it was incompatible with the Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
139	31	The Court of Appeal also gave the employees leave to amend their grounds of application to include a complaint that the Order infringed article 119 of the E.C. Treaty , which lays down the principle that `` men and women should receive equal pay for equal work . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
139	32	It considered , however , that it could not decide that `` pay '' included the right to compensation for unfair dismissal without referring the question to the European Court of Justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
139	33	As it had granted a declaration in respect of the Directive , as a matter of discretion , it decided not to make a reference and granted no relief under article 119 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
139	34	The Secretary of State now appeals to your Lordships ' House against the grant of the declaration by the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
139	35	In opening the appeal , Mr. Elias Q.C. submitted that even if the Court of Appeal was right on the question of discrimination , it should not have made a declaration that the Order was incompatible with the Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
139	36	It could serve no purpose because even if there had been incompatibility at the dates of the dismissals , the Directive could not affect the respective rights and duties of the employees and their employers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
139	37	As for article 119 , Mr. Elias said that it should not be considered in proceedings for judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
139	38	If the employees were right , it conferred upon them rights in private law which they could enforce in an industrial tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
139	39	The latter was therefore the appropriate forum in which the question of discriminatory effect should be decided and which could , if necessary , make a reference to the European Court of Justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
139	40	Your Lordships decided to hear argument on these submissions by way of preliminary points because if they were well founded , the appeal would have to be dismissed without any reference to the Court of Justice or inquiry into whether the Order had a discriminatory effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
139	41	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
139	42	The Equal Treatment Directive Mr. Allen Q.C. , who appeared for the employees , submitted that the declaration of incompatibility with the Equal Treatment Directive made by the Court of Appeal would affect the legal rights of his clients . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
139	43	They would be able to go back to the industrial tribunal and argue that the Order , being incompatible with Community law , should not be given effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
139	44	This would leave them in possession of their rights under the original legislation by which they qualified after one year of employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
139	45	He said that even if your Lordships were not fully persuaded that a directive could have this effect , the contrary was not acte claire and the question should be referred to the Court of Justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
139	46	For the purposes of the preliminary point , it must be assumed that the Order brought English law into conflict with the terms of the Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
139	47	But , by virtue of a consistent jurisprudence expressed in a series of decisions of the Court of Justice , it is in my view acte claire that a directive , as such , has no effect upon the private rights of parties such as the employees in this case and their employers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
139	48	The position is otherwise when the question concerns the rights and duties of the citizen as against the State or one of its emanations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
139	49	The basis of the distinction is explained in the decision of the Court of Justice in Marshall v. Southampton and South-West Hampshire Area Health Authority -LRB- Case 152/84 -RRB- -LSB- 1986 -RSB- E.C.R. 723 , 748-749 : `` 47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
139	50	a Member State which has not adopted the implementing measures required by the directive within the prescribed period may not plead , as against individuals , its own failure to perform the obligations which the directive entails . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
139	51	`` 48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
139	52	With regard to the argument that a directive may not be relied upon against an individual , it must be emphasised that according to article 189 of the EEC Treaty the binding nature of a directive , which constitutes the basis for the possibility of relying on the directive before a national court , exists only in relation to ` each Member State to which it is addressed . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
139	53	It follows that a directive may not of itself impose obligations on an individual and that a provision of a directive may not be relied upon as such against such a person . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
139	54	This reasoning has been reaffirmed by the Court in Faccini Dori v. Recreb S.r.l. -LRB- Case C-91 / 92 -RRB- -LSB- 1994 -RSB- E.C.R. 1-3325 , 1-3355-6 , paras . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
139	55	20-25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
139	56	But Mr. Allen submitted that the recent decision of the court in CIA Security International SA v. Signalson SA -LRB- Case C-194 / 94 -RRB- -LRB- Judgment 30 April 1996 -RRB- shows a departure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
139	57	I do not agree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
139	58	The case arose out of an action for unfair trade practice by a Belgian manufacturer of alarm systems . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
139	59	He complained that a competitor had wrongfully published an assertion that his product did not comply with Belgian law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
139	60	The domestic regulations with which it was said not to comply should have been notified to the Commission under Directive 83/189/EEC and the Court of Justice held that they were accordingly unenforceable against individuals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
139	61	It went on to say that the national court should decline to apply them in the unfair trade practice litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
139	62	There is no hint in the judgment of the court that it intended to depart from its previous jurisprudence and a clear explanation in the opinion of the Advocate-General -LRB- para . 73 -RRB- which shows that he saw no incompatibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
139	63	The case was one in which , unusually , the issue in litigation between private parties was whether , as a matter of public law , the manufacturer was doing something unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
139	64	If the regulation alleged to have been infringed could not be enforced against him by the State , it could not be right for the defendant to say that his alarm system did not comply with the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
139	65	I therefore regard the CIA case as plainly distinguishable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
139	66	Mr. Allen tried to build upon the Marshall doctrine that directives can confer rights upon individuals against the State by saying that the employees had a right against the State as legislator that it should implement , or not legislate incompatibly with , a directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
139	67	On this basis they were entitled to have relief against the State clearing the Order out of their path and leaving them free to sue their employers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
139	68	But this seems to me no more than a play upon words , a piece of legerdemain with the word `` right . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
139	69	The basis of the enforceability of directives against the State and its emanations is a species of estoppel : the Member State `` may not plead , as against individuals , its own failure to perform the obligations which the directive entails . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
139	70	But the individual has no right to a mandamus against the State in his national court requiring that the directive be implemented : see the opinion of the Advocate General , Sir Gordon Slynn in Marshall at pp. 734-735 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
139	71	In the last resort it is for the Commission to take proceedings under article 169 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
139	72	The `` right '' asserted by Mr. Allen would be something quite different from the rights against the State applied in Marshall . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
139	73	The effect would be to give the Directive , by an easy two-stage process , the very effect which the jurisprudence of the Court says it can not have , namely to impose obligations upon an individual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
139	74	Furthermore , those obligations would be imposed arbitrarily and retrospectively , depending upon whether and when some interested person brought proceedings in public law to assert his `` right '' against the State to have incompatible domestic law set aside . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
139	75	This seems to me inconsistent with the principle of legal certainty which is one of the fundamental doctrines of European law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
139	76	Finally Mr. Allen said that the employees were not asserting any rights under the Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
139	77	Their complaint to the industrial tribunal will be based upon section 54 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act of 1978 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
139	78	They relied upon the Directive only for the negative purpose of disapplying the restriction upon the rights conferred by that section which was created by the Order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
139	79	This again seems to me a play upon words . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
139	80	Section 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the European Communities Act 1972 says : `` All such rights , powers , liabilities , obligations and restrictions from time to time created or arising by or under the Treaties as in accordance with the Treaties are without further enactment to be given legal effect or used in the United Kingdom shall be recognised and available in law , and be enforced , allowed and followed accordingly ; '' Section 2 -LRB- 4 -RRB- says : '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
139	81	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
139	82	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
139	83	any enactment passed or to be passed shall be construed and have effect subject to the foregoing provisions of this section ; '' Thus domestic legislation is to have effect subject to such European rights or restrictions `` as in accordance with the Treaties are without further enactment to be given legal effect or used in the United Kingdom . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
139	84	In other respects , the validity of domestic legislation is unaffected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
139	85	The effect of the decisions in Marshall and Faccini Dori is that , except in proceedings which bring into question the legal relations between the individual and the State or its emanations , directives do not give rise to rights or restrictions which without further enactment are required to be given legal effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
139	86	Accordingly , section 2 -LRB- 4 -RRB- does not enable them to affect the validity or construction of domestic legislation such as the Order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
139	87	Mr. Allen 's distinction between using a directive as a source of rights and as a means of disapplying a restriction on rights which otherwise be available in domestic law is in my view quite unworkable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
139	88	It would produce arbitrary results according to whether domestic legislation was framed by reference to positive conditions or as a general rule subject to exceptions , even though the substantive effect was precisely the same . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
139	89	I therefore think that it is acte clair that a declaration such as was made by the Court of Appeal would not enable the employees to pursue their proceedings in the industrial court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
139	90	Would it serve any other purpose ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
139	91	Two have been suggested . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
139	92	In the first place , it is said that although a citizen of a Member State may not be entitled to a mandamus requiring a directive to be implemented , he should be able to obtain a declaration that domestic law is incompatible with Community law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
139	93	This would draw the matter to the attention of the government and fulfil the function of supervising the implementation of the Treaties which the Court of Justice in N.V. Algemene Transport - en Expeditie Onderneming van Gend en Loos v. Nederlandse administratie der belastingen -LSB- 1963 -RSB- E.C.R. 1 , 13 said could be fulfilled by the vigilance of individuals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
139	94	Secondly , it was submitted that such a declaration could form a foundation for a claim for damages against the State for its failure to implement the Directive under the rule laid down by the Court of Justice in Francovich & Boniface v. Italian Republic -LRB- Cases C-6 and 9/90 -RRB- -LSB- 1995 -RSB- I.C.R. 722 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
139	95	In Reg . v. Secretary of State for Employment , Ex parte Equal Opportunities Commission -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 1 A.C. 1 , this House decided that there was jurisdiction to make a declaration that United Kingdom legislation on the threshold conditions for redundancy pay was incompatible with the Equal Treatment Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
139	96	It also decided that the Equal Opportunities Commission had a `` sufficient interest in the matter '' within the meaning of R.S.C. , Ord . 53 , r. 3 -LRB- 7 -RRB- to have locus standi to apply for such a declaration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
139	97	Like Balcombe L.J. in the Divisional Court in this case , I think it would be curious if individuals who assert that they are directly affected by failure to implement a directive should not have locus standi to apply for a similar declaration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
139	98	The difficulty is that the declaration made by the Court of Appeal was not that United Kingdom legislation was incompatible with Community law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
139	99	It was that such incompatibility existed in May of 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
139	100	This was founded upon evidence that the two year qualifying period had a considerable greater adverse impact upon women than upon men during the years 1985-1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
139	101	Non constat that it was having such a discriminatory effect at the time of the judgment in the summer of 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
139	102	On the contrary , the evidence showed that by 1993 the gap between the ratios of men and women who qualified had narrowed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
139	103	Thus the declaration made by the Court of Appeal neither enabled the employees to sue for unfair dismissal nor told the Government -LRB- or any other interested party -RRB- that United Kingdom legislation needed to be changed because it was incompatible with Community law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
139	104	Nor do I think it would be right for your Lordships to declare , upon a fresh examination of the evidence , that incompatibility existed at some later date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
139	105	Your Lordships are a court of appeal and it is not your function to make fresh findings of fact to support a declaration which was never sought in the Divisional Court or Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
139	106	In the Divisional Court -LSB- 1995 -RSB- I.C.R. 889 , Balcombe L.J. said , at pp. 901-902 : `` The applicants are not presently interested in anything less than an order to quash the Order of 1985 : a declaration , such as that made in Reg . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
139	107	v. Secretary of State for Employment , Ex parte Equal Opportunities Commission -LSB- 1994 -RSB- I.C.R. 317 , that its provisions are incompatible with the Equal Treatment Directive , would not help them in their claims for compensation for unfair dismissal '' By the time the case came to the Court of Appeal , the employees were content to ask , in the alternative , for the declaration which was made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
139	108	It is clear , however , from the argument submitted to your Lordships by Mr. Allen , that this declaration was sought with a view to persuading an industrial tribunal that it should disregard the extension of the qualification period made by the Order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
139	109	It was therefore , as the Court of Appeal specified , related to the dates of dismissal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
139	110	There was no argument on the question of whether in the then state of the employment market , the Order was having a discriminatory effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
139	111	Neither side produced any evidence of the position after 1993 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
139	112	The second contention is that the Court of Appeal declaration can found a Francovich claim against the State . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
139	113	In the Equal Opportunities Commission case -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 1 A.C. 1 , this House refused to make a declaration on similar grounds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
139	114	Lord Keith of Kinkel said , at p. 32 : `` In my opinion it would be quite inappropriate to make any such declaration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
139	115	If there is any individual who believes that he or she has a good claim to compensation under the Francovich principle , it is the Attorney-General who would be defendant in any proceedings directed to enforcing it , and the issues raised would not necessarily be identical with any of those which arise in the present appeal . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
139	116	For my part , I can see no grounds upon which this reasoning does not apply to the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
139	117	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
139	118	Article 119 of the Treaty Mr. Elias accepted that if the Order was contrary to the terms of article 119 , the employees have directly enforceable rights which they are entitled to assert in the industrial tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
139	119	For that very reason , he says that the House should not entertain the question in proceedings for judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
139	120	The industrial tribunal is the more appropriate forum . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
139	121	He relied upon the Equal Opportunities Commission case -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 1 A.C. 1 , in which the House refused to entertain an application for judicial review by a second applicant , a Mrs Day , who was employed by the Hertfordshire County Council . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
139	122	Since the Council counted as an emanation of the State for the purposes of the Marshall principle , Mrs Day was entitled to rely upon the Directive in proceedings against her employer in an industrial tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
139	123	Lord Keith of Kinkel said , at p. 25 : `` Mrs Day 's claim against her employers is a private law claim , and indeed she has already started proceedings to enforce it in the appropriate industrial tribunal , these having been adjourned to await the outcome of the present case . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
139	124	I interpolate that the employees in this case are in the same position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
139	125	Lord Keith of Kinkel went on : `` The industrial tribunal has jurisdiction to decide questions as to objective justification for discrimination measures , and has done so on many occasions , in particular in the Marshall case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
139	126	I see no good reason why a purely private law claim should be advanced in the Divisional Court against the Secretary of State , who is not the claimant 's employer and is not liable to meet the claim , if sound . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
139	127	The determination of such claims has been entrusted by statute to the industrial tribunal , which is fully competent to deal with them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
139	128	It is suggested that different industrial tribunals might reach different decisions on the facts in relation to objective justification , but a suitable test case upon the question of principle , supported by the E.O.C. under the power conferred upon it be section 75 of the Act of 1975 , would be capable of settling the question definitively . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
139	129	I conclude that the Divisional Court was not the appropriate forum to adjudicate upon what so far as Mrs Day is concerned is her private law claim , and would dismiss her appeal , but without costs . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
139	130	Mr. Elias says that the same reasoning applies in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
139	131	If the employees are right about article 119 , they have a private law claim which they should pursue in an industrial tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
139	132	I agree , for the reasons so cogently stated by Lord Keith of Kinkel , that a person claiming to be entitled as a matter of private law to compensation for unfair dismissal should ordinarily bring her proceedings in the industrial tribunal , even if they will raise an issue of incompatibility between domestic and Community law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
139	133	But this is an exceptional case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
139	134	The question of compatibility with article 119 was raised for the first time in the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
139	135	I need not discuss the reasons why it was raised so late : the Court of Appeal was satisfied that it was right to give leave to amend . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
139	136	Subject to the question of the meaning of `` pay , '' it raised the same issues as the question of incompatibility with the Directive and could be resolved on the evidence which had been put before the Divisional Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
139	137	The position is the same before this House and the parties have come prepared to deal with it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
139	138	I therefore think it would be wrong for the House to tell the employees at this stage that they must start again before the Industrial Tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
139	139	The House should in my view entertain the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
139	140	But the parties are agreed that it is necessary to enable the House to give judgment that the European Court of Justice should be requested to give preliminary rulings on certain questions on the construction of article 119 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
139	141	Your Lordships have received the submissions of the parties on the drafting of those questions and , having considered those submissions , I would propose that the following questions be referred : 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
139	142	Does an award of compensation for breach of the right not to be unfairly dismissed under national legislation such as the Employment Protection -LRB- Consolidation -RRB- Act 1978 constitute `` pay '' within the meaning of article 119 of the EC Treaty ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
139	143	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
139	144	If the answer to question 1 is `` yes , '' do the conditions determining whether a worker has the right not to be unfairly dismissed fall within the scope of article 119 or that of Directive 76/207 ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
139	145	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
139	146	What is the legal test for establishing whether a measure adopted by a Member State has such a degree of disparate effect as between men and women as to amount to indirect discrimination for the purposes of article 119 of the EC Treaty unless shown to be based upon objectively justified factors other than sex ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
139	147	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
139	148	When must this legal test be applied to a measure adopted by a Member State ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
139	149	In particular at which of the following points in time , or at what other point in time , must it be applied to the measure : -LRB- a -RRB- When the measure is adopted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
139	150	-LRB- b -RRB- When the measure is brought into force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann

139	152	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
139	153	What are the legal conditions for establishing the objective justification , for the purposes of indirect discrimination under article 119 , of a measure adopted by a Member State in pursuance of its social policy ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
139	154	In particular , what material need the Member State adduce in support of its grounds for justification ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
139	155	I would therefore discharge the declaration made by the Court of Appeal and adjourn further consideration of the appeal until after the judgment of the Court of Justice . 	lord hoffmann	self	outcome	0.9	lord hoffmann
139	156	For the convenience of your Lordships and the parties I would suggest that further argument should not necessarily be before the same Appellate Committee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
139	157	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
139	158	Does an award of compensation for breach of the right not to be unfairly dismissed under national legislation such as the Employment Protection -LRB- Consolidation -RRB- Act 1978 constitute `` pay '' within the meaning of article 119 of the EC Treaty ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
