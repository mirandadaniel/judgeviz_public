86	6	Not without some hesitation I align myself with the reasoning and conclusion of Lord Neuberger . 	lord phillips	lord neuberger	fullagr	0	NAN
86	7	It seems to me that the draftsman of sections 26 , 28 , 103 and 105 of the Extradition Act 2003 was concerned not merely to make provision for the speedy implementation of the appropriate process for bringing an appeal , but for giving notice of this with equal expedition to those so vitally concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
86	8	Where extradition has been ordered the authority that has , should there be no appeal , the responsibility for procuring the extradition within the very short ` required period ' needs to know at the earliest opportunity if there is to be an appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
86	9	Equally , if discharge has been ordered , the person whose extradition is sought will be anxious to know at the earliest opportunity if the warrant or the extradition request is `` disposed of '' , within the provisions of section 213 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN

86	28	LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	29	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	30	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	31	If someone who is facing extradition wishes to appeal against the order of the District Judge , does section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- or 103 -LRB- 9 -RRB- of the Extradition Act 2003 -LRB- `` the 2003 Act '' -RRB- require that he should not only file his appellant 's notice but serve it on the respondent within the specified period of 7 or 14 days ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	32	Your Lordships agree with my noble and learned friend , Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury , that the Act requires that both should be done within that time . 	lord rodger	all	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	33	Indeed , to my noble and learned friend , Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood , that construction is `` tolerably plain '' . 	lord rodger	all	partagr	0.1	NAN
86	34	I content myself with saying that I find the reasons advanced for your Lordships ' construction unpersuasive . 	lord rodger	all	partdisa	0.1	NAN
86	35	In my view , all that Parliament requires is that the appeal should be filed within the specified period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	36	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	37	I approach the interpretation of sections 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- and 103 -LRB- 9 -RRB- on the basis that Parliament rarely gets involved in matters of procedure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	38	It may lay down a time for raising proceedings or bringing an appeal , but it stops at the door of the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	39	Parliament does n't teach its grandmother to suck eggs : it proceeds on the assumption that the courts are experienced in matters of procedure and their rule-making bodies know best how they should be regulated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	40	Given the umpteen rules and countless practice directions in the Civil Procedure Rules -LRB- `` CPR '' -RRB- , not to mention their equivalents in Scotland and Northern Ireland , that seems a fair assumption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	41	Rules on service are quintessentially matters of procedure , which are liable to differ in the different jurisdictions and which may be altered from time to time in the light of experience and advances in technology . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	42	So if , exceptionally , Parliament had intended to enter the realm of procedure and prescribe an immovable date for service of an extradition appeal , I should have expected it to spell that out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	43	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	44	What is the practical issue which lies behind these appeals ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	45	Presumably , it is illustrated by Mr Mucelli 's case where the appellant 's notice was filed within the 14 day period permitted by section 103 -LRB- 9 -RRB- , but was not served on the Crown Prosecution Service -LRB- on behalf of the Government of Albania -RRB- until about two weeks later . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	46	Since PD22 .6 A -LRB- 5 -RRB- provides that the notice must be filed and served before the expiry of 14 days , this was a clear breach of the practice direction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	47	Admittedly , if section 103 -LRB- 9 -RRB- does not prescribe a time-limit , there may be no clear sanction for such a breach , but the same applies to all appeals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	48	If the lack of a sanction means that the rules for service of appeals are not being observed and this is causing practical problems , it is surprising that they have not been amended before now . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	49	In fact , however , Mr Nicol QC , who appeared for the Albanian Government and the French prosecutor , did not put forward anything to show that , when the 2003 Act was passed , this was recognised to be a significant problem with appeals in general or was anticipated as being a particular problem with extradition appeals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	50	In other words , there is nothing to show that this was a mischief which Parliament was addressing in sections 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- and 103 -LRB- 9 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	51	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	52	A relatively short but utterly rigid deadline for bringing an appeal is readily understandable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	53	Even so , it imposes a substantial burden on a prospective appellant and his advisers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	54	The question is whether Parliament considered that , exceptionally , the matter of service had to be taken out of the hands of the courts and subjected to the same immovable time-limit - with failure to meet the deadline resulting in the prisoner 's extradition , however meritorious the appeal that had been filed , however venial the slip that had resulted in service being late , and however little the prejudice that it had caused to the respondent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	55	The potential for substantial injustice is striking . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	56	Busy practitioners with many demands on their time may , quite understandably , fall down from time to time - as Mr Moulai 's case vividly illustrates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	57	Rules of court on procedural matters are designed to allow for these realities and to enable substantial justice to be done . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	58	If the intention was , on this occasion , to ignore these realities and impose a rigid deadline for service , I would again have expected the Bill to say so in clear terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	59	Members of Parliament could then have seen that this was what they were being asked to enact and could have pondered the consequences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	60	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	61	The suggestion is that , despite all this , Parliament did indeed lay down a rigid time-limit for service in section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- because of the emphasis in the Framework Directive on the need for speed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	62	As Lord Neuberger acknowledges , this argument is weakened by the fact that the wording in section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- , which is supposed to have been prompted by the Framework Directive , also turns up in section 103 -LRB- 9 -RRB- - and that provision deals with appeals which have nothing to do with the Framework Directive . 	lord rodger	lord neuberger	partagr	0.1	NAN
86	63	It is further weakened by the fact that Parliament did not find it necessary to enact other , more obvious , measures to ensure the speedy disposal of appeals , e g , prescribing a timetable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	64	Instead , these have been left , entirely appropriately , to the courts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	65	And - no doubt , with official encouragement - the relevant rule-making bodies have met the challenge by prescribing a timetable which aims to ensure that extradition appeals are heard quickly : PD22 .6 A -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- and -LRB- 4 -RRB- , -LRB- 9 -RRB- - -LRB- 11 -RRB- in England and Wales ; rule 34.4 , especially paras -LRB- 5 -RRB- and -LRB- 6 -RRB- , of the Act of Adjournal -LRB- Criminal Procedure -RRB- Rules 1996 -LRB- `` the Act of Adjournal '' -RRB- in Scotland ; Order 61A , rule 4 , of the Rules of the Supreme Court -LRB- Northern Ireland -RRB- in Northern Ireland . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	66	If Parliament could trust the rule-making bodies to ensure the rapid disposal of appeals , it is hard to see why it could not trust them to deal with the lesser matter of timely service . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	67	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	68	With these considerations in mind , I turn to look at sections 24 -LRB- 6 -RRB- and 104 -LRB- 3 -RRB- themselves . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	69	In interpreting them , like Lord Neuberger , I pay no attention whatever to the explanatory notes as an indication of their meaning . 	lord rodger	lord neuberger	partagr	0.1	NAN
86	70	In this case the notes do not identify the mischief behind the enactments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	71	Nobody outside government knows who drafted them , or revised them or on what basis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	72	They can not be regarded as any kind of authoritative guide to the meaning of the provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	73	The focus must be on the words of the provisions themselves . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	74	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	75	Section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- says that `` Notice of an appeal under this section must be given in accordance with rules of court before the end of the permitted period '' of 7 days . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	76	To state my conclusion : I consider that a person threatened with extradition would read these words as telling him that , if he wanted to appeal , he must give notice of his appeal within 7 days in the manner indicated in the relevant rules of court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	77	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	78	When interpreting the provision , the House has to bear in mind that section 26 , like most of the relevant provisions of the Extradition Act , extends not only to England and Wales but to the whole of the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	79	The provisions are drafted , and must be interpreted , on that basis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
86	80	This is indeed of some immediate relevance in the case of sections 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- and 103 -LRB- 9 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	81	In Scotland , the people still walk in darkness and upon them hath the light of the CPR not shined . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	82	So there can be no question of interpreting the terms of the statute in the light of the CPR - or of the Scottish or Northern Irish rules , for that matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	83	Indeed , the idea that someone threatened with extradition and wondering how to appeal would read section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- or 103 -LRB- 9 -RRB- with the terminology of the English , Scottish or Northern Irish rules already in mind is unrealistic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	84	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	85	Nevertheless , if he wants to know how he is to go about giving due notice of his appeal , a potential appellant has to have regard to the requirements imposed by the rules of court for the jurisdiction in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	86	As they stand at present , within the period specified in the Act , the appellant 's notice must be `` filed '' in England , the originating motion must be `` issued '' in Northern Ireland , and the notice of appeal must be `` lodged '' in Scotland . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	87	Of course , all or any of these ways of starting an appeal can change at any time if the relevant rule-making body chooses to amend the rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	88	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	89	In arguing that the obligation under the 2003 Act goes further , Mr Nicol made a number of detailed points on sections 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- and 103 -LRB- 9 -RRB- , which are similar in all material respects . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	90	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	91	He rightly drew attention to the change in language from `` an appeal under this section may be brought '' in subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- of section 26 to `` Notice of an appeal under this section must be given '' in subsection -LRB- 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	92	The suggestion was that , since subsection -LRB- 4 -RRB- could have been drafted as `` An appeal under this section must be brought ... , '' the language actually used must mean something different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	93	Lord Neuberger accepts that argument . 	lord rodger	lord neuberger	partagr	0.2	NAN
86	94	For my part , I readily accept that it is a point to bear in mind , but its significance has to be assessed in the context of all the other relevant considerations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	95	If the matter is viewed in that way , it seems to me that the draftsman has just chosen a familiar form of words for referring to the bringing of an appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	96	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	97	Mr Nicol argued , however , that the form of words in section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- was special , since it referred to notice of `` an '' appeal being given . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	98	From this use of the indefinite article he deduced that Parliament envisaged the appellant first filing the appeal and then serving notice of the appeal which he had brought by filing it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	99	So service on the Serious Organised Crime Agency -LRB- `` SOCA '' -RRB- was caught by the provision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	100	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	101	This argument ignores the fact that in section 35 Parliament uses `` notice of an appeal '' in subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- and `` notice of appeal '' in subsections -LRB- 4 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- and -LRB- 6 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- interchangeably . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	102	Indeed - at the risk of engaging in a `` minute examination of a large number of the 2003 Act 's many sections '' - the simple reality is that the draftsman prefers to use `` notice of an appeal '' when saying that notice of an appeal `` is '' or `` must be '' given -LRB- sections 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- , 28 -LRB- 4 -RRB- , 103 -LRB- 8 -RRB- and -LRB- 9 -RRB- , 105 -LRB- 5 -RRB- and 124 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- -RRB- or when referring to situations where no notice of an appeal `` is '' given -LRB- sections 35 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- and 117 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- -RRB- , but uses `` notice of appeal '' when referring to the period `` for giving '' notice of appeal -LRB- sections 35 -LRB- 4 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- and 6 -LRB- a -RRB- , 117 -LRB- 4 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- , 213 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- and -LRB- 5 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- , 214 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- and -LRB- 4 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	103	The choice of expression appears to be based on purely stylistic grounds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	104	Since the expressions with and without the indefinite article are used interchangeably , there is no basis for attributing particular legal significance to the indefinite article in section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	105	The provision would have meant the same if the draftsman had said `` Notice of appeal under this section must be given ... '' Therefore , the inclusion of the indefinite article is not a sound basis for inferring that Parliament envisages notice being given to the CPS of an appeal that has already been brought by filing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	106	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	107	In fact , Parliament speaks about giving notice of appeal in all kinds of statutes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	108	Most obviously , perhaps , section 18 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 provide inter alia that a person who wishes to appeal to the Court of Appeal `` shall give notice of appeal ... in such manner as may be directed by rules of court '' and that `` -LSB- n -RSB- otice of appeal ... shall be given within twenty-eight days from the date of conviction '' etc. . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	109	What matters for present purposes is that , under Part 68 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2005 , -LRB- SI 2005/384 -RRB- there is no requirement on the potential appellant to give notice of the appeal to any other person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	110	So the obligation in section 18 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- to give notice of appeal has not been interpreted as imposing an obligation to notify anyone , apart from the court , about the appeal within 28 days . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	111	Of course , the meaning of words as used in one Act can not be determined by their meaning as used in a different Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	112	Nevertheless , in interpreting what looks like a stock expression , it would be unwise to ignore completely the usage elsewhere . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	113	This suggests that the words simply refer to notifying the relevant court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	114	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	115	Mr Nicol 's argument was that the words `` Notice of an appeal under this section must be given in accordance with rules of court '' in section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- were to be interpreted as themselves imposing a requirement for both filing and service to be effected within 7 days . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	116	In other words , the draftsman is supposed to have used the phrase `` notice of an appeal is to be given '' to impose not one obligation , but two distinct obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	117	That would , in itself , be most unusual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	118	But , if that had indeed been the intention , the provision would have had to say on whom service was to be made - even if only by saying that it was to be made on the persons to be specified in an order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	119	Of course , Lord Neuberger sees the problem and he seeks to supply that crucial omission by praying in aid the rules of court : `` there is nowhere else to look . '' 	lord rodger	lord neuberger	partagr	0.2	NAN
86	120	Quite so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	121	But that is simply another way of saying that section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- itself does not actually impose any requirement for service on anyone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	122	Suppose that , like the Criminal Appeal Rules , the CPR contained no rule requiring service of an extradition appeal on anyone and left it up to the registrar to notify interested parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	123	On Lord Neuberger 's reading , section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- would then impose no obligation to serve the appeal notice on SOCA or anyone else within seven days . 	lord rodger	lord neuberger	partagr	0.2	NAN
86	124	Which shows that the obligation to serve is not to be found in the subsection itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	125	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	126	The supposed requirement for an appellant first to file and then to serve may be attractive to a reader who is familiar with the CPR , which generally provide for filing followed by service . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	127	The same sequence seems to be envisaged for extradition appeals in Northern Ireland : Order 61 , Rule 3 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	128	But an interpretation is not to be preferred because of its supposed conformity with particular national rules of court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	129	After all , as already explained , the sequence in the Scottish rule on extradition appeals is precisely the reverse . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	130	Under rule 34.3 no note of appeal can be lodged without an execution of service on the Crown Agent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	131	So the appellant must have , say , posted a copy of the note of appeal to the Crown Agent before the appeal is `` made '' by `` lodging '' the note of appeal -LRB- rule 34.3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	132	This is not the product of some invariable rule for Scottish criminal appeals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
86	133	On the contrary , practice varies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	134	For example , under rule 9A .7 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of Adjournal , in appeals from a preliminary hearing , the appellant is merely required to send a copy of the note of appeal to the other parties -LRB- including the Crown -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	135	So the requirement for prior service in rule 34.3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- may well have been deliberately chosen for extradition appeals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	136	Of course , the sequence in rule 34.3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- does not show that Lord Neuberger 's preferred interpretation of section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- is wrong - any more than the sequence in the CPR and the Northern Irish Rules shows that it is correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	137	In that respect they are all irrelevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	138	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	139	But , in another sense , the sequence in the CPR is highly relevant - because it is actually the source of the perceived problem that people will file their extradition appeals within 7 days , but then ignore the requirement of PD22 .6 A that they should serve a copy on SOCA or the CPS within 7 or 14 days . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	140	This in turn is taken as justification for interpreting sections 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- and 103 -LRB- 9 -RRB- as imposing a deadline for service as well as filing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	141	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	142	In Scotland , that problem should not arise because rule 34.3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- has been framed to provide that in an extradition case no note of appeal can be lodged without an execution of service . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	143	Similarly , under direction 4.14 of the House of Lords Practice Directions Applicable to Criminal Appeals , in extradition appeals a certificate of service on the government concerned or the Director of Public Prosecutions must be endorsed on the back of the original petition of appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	144	So , again , when section 32 -LRB- 6 -RRB- of the 2003 Act provides that an application to the House of Lords for leave to appeal must be made within 14 days , the words are to be interpreted in a straightforward way , as referring to the lodgment of the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	145	Thanks to the practice direction , however , service as well as lodgment should have taken place within 14 days . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	146	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	147	There is nothing in the Ten Commandments or in any statute which requires the English High Court to insist on the sequence of filing and then service in extradition appeals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	148	So , if there is a real practical problem of late service under the present version of PD22 .6 A -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- , the Lord Chief Justice has the power to address it by amending the direction to bring it into line with the practice direction of the House of Lords , not to mention rule 34.3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- in the Act of Adjournal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	149	Such a rule change would still , of course , leave the court with a measure of flexibility to deal with situations where the appeal has been filed but , for some reason , service has not actually been effected in accordance with the rule . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	150	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	151	A rule of that kind would meet the possible difficulties in operating section 35 which are prayed in aid as a reason for reading section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- as referring to service . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	152	It is hard , in any event , to see that these could have been the reason for the language used in sections 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- and 103 -LRB- 9 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	153	After all , exactly the same language is used in sections 28 -LRB- 4 -RRB- and 105 -LRB- 5 -RRB- , which deal with appeals against the person 's discharge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	154	Section 35 has no part to play in appeals of that kind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	155	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	156	For all these reasons I am not persuaded by either the substantive or the linguistic arguments advanced in favour of Lord Neuberger 's interpretation . 	lord rodger	lord neuberger	fulldisa	0.3	NAN
86	157	I would interpret sections 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- and 103 -LRB- 9 -RRB- as simply requiring the appellant 's notice to be filed within 7 and 14 days respectively . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	158	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	159	So far as filing an appellant 's notice is concerned , I respectfully agree with Lord Neuberger 's conclusion that the time limits under sections 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- and 103 -LRB- 9 -RRB- can not be extended . 	lord rodger	lord neuberger	NAN	0.3	NAN

86	161	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	162	For my part , I would dismiss the appeal in Mr Moulai 's case since his appellant 's notice was filed within 7 days , as required by both the 2003 Act and the relevant practice direction , and it was also , in fact , served within 7 days as required by the practice direction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	163	In Mr Mucelli 's case , his appellant 's notice was filed within 14 days , as required by both the 2003 Act and the relevant practice direction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	164	Admittedly , his notice was not served on the Crown Prosecution Service within 14 days , but that was simply a requirement of PD22 .6 A -LRB- 5 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	165	The Divisional Court would therefore have had power to extend the time for service or to dispense with service . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
86	166	But , on any view , the mere failure to serve within the time specified in the practice direction is not a basis for dismissing an appeal which has been duly filed within the 14 days allowed by Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

86	191	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	192	Section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the Extradition Act 2003 provides that : `` Notice of an appeal -LSB- against a district judge 's order for extradition -RSB- must be given in accordance with rules of court before the end of seven days starting with the day on which the order is made '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	193	A number of other sections in the Act provide in similar terms for the giving of notices of appeal within a specified period , sometimes seven days , sometimes fourteen . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	194	The core questions at the heart of these two appeals are , first , what is meant by the requirement that notice be `` given '' -- does that mean merely filed with the court or both filed with the court and served on the respondent ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	195	; secondly , whichever is meant , is such judicial discretion as is ordinarily available under the rules of court -- variously to extend time for compliance with any rule -LRB- CPR r. 3.1 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- -RRB- , to vary the time limit for filing an appeal notice -LRB- r. 52.6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- , to dispense with service -LRB- r. 6.9 -RRB- , or perhaps more generally to remedy errors -LRB- r. 3.10 -RRB- -- available in this context to overcome any failure to give notice within the specified time ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	196	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	197	In both cases before your Lordships it so happens that notice of the proposed appeal was filed with the court within the specified time -- seven days in Moulai 's case , fourteen days in Mucelli 's -LRB- under section 103 -LRB- a -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	198	But in neither case was it served within the specified time -- unless receipt of the notice of Moulai 's appeal on the respondent 's fax machine by just after 4 pm on the seventh day can be regarded as service before the end of that day for the purposes of section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- , a question to which I shall return . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	199	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	200	On both these central issues -- the meaning in section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of `` given '' and the question whether any discretion arises -- your Lordships were treated to a series of elaborate arguments involving the minute examination of a large number of the 2003 Act 's many sections . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	201	I confess to having found most of them ultimately unhelpful -- and , indeed , there is a risk of the court actually being misled by them , as was Hooper LJ in Moulai 's case by the reference in section 213 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- to the `` period permitted for giving notice of an appeal to the High Court , '' an expression which he understood to mean that notice had to be given -LRB- only -RRB- to the High Court , but is no less capable of meaning that notice -LRB- of an appeal to the High Court -RRB- has to be given , leaving open the question of whether only to the Court or also to the respondent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	202	For my part I think the issues can be comparatively shortly resolved and are best considered compendiously rather than as two discrete questions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	203	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	204	Article 17 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Framework Decision requires that European arrest warrants `` be dealt with and executed as a matter of urgency '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	205	Part 1 of the 2003 Act was enacted to give effect to this obligation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	206	It is hardly surprising , therefore , that section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- should specify so short a time limit or that section 35 should , in turn , require the fugitive 's extradition within 17 days -LRB- it used to be only 10 -RRB- of the judge 's extradition order , unless -LRB- section 35 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- -RRB- `` notice of an appeal under section 26 is given before the end of the -LSB- 7-day -RSB- period '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	207	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	208	On any view section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- requires the notice of appeal to be filed within 7 days . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	209	It is scarcely even arguable that the 7-day period is extendable under the rules in respect of filing , and certainly this was not the view of either Divisional Court below : plainly something must be done to keep the extradition challenge alive and to stop time running for the fugitive 's physical removal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	210	But if the 7-day period is unextendable for filing , why should it not have been intended to apply also to service and to be unextendable in respect of that too ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	211	Plainly the respondent has to be served and needs to know , not least for section 35 purposes , whether the 17-day period for effecting extradition has stopped running . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	212	If `` giving '' meant only filing and not also serving , then there would be no statutory provision at all for service and that matter would be left entirely to the rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	213	-LRB- In Scotland , of course , filing follows service so that a time limit for filing by definition encompasses also service . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	214	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	215	If , moreover , the time for filing is unextendable , surely it makes no sense to allow time for service to be extendable , let alone to allow service to be dispensed with . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	216	True , in these particular cases , certainly in Mucelli , it would make a difference . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	217	But generally that would not be so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	218	There is no more difficulty in serving in time than in filing in time and usually both will be , and invariably both should be , achieved more or less contemporaneously before the specified period elapses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	219	And just as there is really very little purpose in allowing flexibility for the time of service when there can be none for the time of filing , so too there would be disproportionate disadvantages in such an arrangement , notably the complete loss of clarity and certainty so essential to the efficient and expeditious working of the new extradition scheme . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	220	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	221	Against this background it seems to me tolerably plain both that section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- is requiring the notice of any appeal to be both filed and served within the stipulated 7-day period and that this , being a statutory time limit , is unextendable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	222	The rules of court are to dictate everything about the filing and serving of the notice save only the period within which this must be done ; this is expressly dictated by the section itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	223	Whatever discretions arise under the rules are exercisable only insofar as is consistent with the filing and serving of the notice before the statutory time limit expires . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	224	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	225	But by the same token that the court has no discretion under the rules to extend time for filing and serving the notice beyond the 7-day limit , so too the rules themselves can not operate to limit the period for achieving service to less than the stipulated 7 days . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	226	Effectively that is what rule 6.7 -LRB- 1 -RRB- does by deeming a faxed notice , transmitted after 4 pm on a business day , to be served not on that day but on the next business day . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	227	On any view the court can not be denied a discretion to make an order which operates to extend time up to midnight on the seventh day . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
86	228	Here all that is required in Moulai 's case is to treat his failure to complete the transmission of his faxed notice of appeal by 4 pm as remediable under rule 3.10 , alternatively to extend time for faxing the notice to shortly after 4 pm on the day in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

86	314	The requirement that notice of an appeal must be given 54 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	315	The first question to be considered is whether the requirements in sections 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- and 103 -LRB- 9 -RRB- that `` Notice of an appeal ... must be given '' within the period specified requires only that an appeal notice be filed at the Court Office or whether it also requires the notice to be served on the respondent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	316	I propose first to address this question by reference to section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	317	55 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	318	In that connection , it is important to recognise from the outset that , while the argument before your Lordships focussed on the procedure in the courts of England and Wales , whence both these appeals originate , the 2003 Act applies across the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	319	Accordingly , as my noble and learned friend , Lord Rodger of Earlsferry points out , the question , indeed all three questions on this appeal , must be considered by reference to the court procedures in the jurisdictions of Scotland and of Northern Ireland , as well as that of England and Wales , with a view to producing fair and workable answers , which not only comply with the statutory language , but which also produce consistency across the United Kingdom . 	lord neuberger	lord rodger	partagr	0.6	NAN

86	321	The word `` given '' in connection with notices of appeal is not to be found in CPR Part 52 , which contains the rules of court , concerned with civil appeals in England and Wales , including those to the High Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	322	Thus , para 22.6 A of Practice Direction 52 , which applies to extradition appeals , by virtue of CPR 52.2 , requires `` the appellant 's notice '' to be `` filed and served before the expiration of 7 days '' , reflecting the language of CPR 52.4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and CPR 52.4 -LRB- 3 -RRB- Although CPR 52 refers to `` an appeal notice '' , that expression covers a respondent 's notice as well as an appellant 's notice -LRB- see e.g. CPR 52.5 and 52.6 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	323	57 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	324	The position with regard to the language of the relevant provisions which govern appeals under the 2003 Act outside England and Wales is as follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	325	The word `` given '' is to be found in the relevant provisions of the Act of Adjournal -LRB- Criminal Proceedings -RRB- 1996 applicable in Scotland . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	326	Rule 34.3 of the Act of Adjournal refers to `` notice of an appeal '' being `` given '' by `` serving a copy of the note of appeal '' , and an appeal being `` made '' by `` lodging '' the note at the appropriate court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	327	The concept of `` giving '' notice of an appeal is not to be found in the relevant procedural rule in Northern Ireland , Order 61A rule 3 of the Rules of the Supreme Court -LRB- Northern Ireland -RRB- , which refers to `` issu -LSB- ing '' a `` notice of motion '' , `` enter -LSB- ing -RSB- '' the appeal `` for hearing in the appropriate office '' , and `` serv -LSB- ing -RSB- a copy of the notice of motion '' .

86	328	58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	329	The preliminary procedures relating to the bringing of an appeal under section 26 in England and Wales and in Northern Ireland also differ from those in Scotland . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	330	In the former cases , the appellant 's notice must be filed at court before it is served on the respondent -LRB- see CPR 52.4.3 and Order 61A , rule 3 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	331	In Scotland , however , rule 34.3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Act of Adjournal provides that execution of service of the note of appeal on the Crown Agent must be effected before the appeal is made by lodging it with the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	332	59 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	333	At the end of the argument before your Lordships , based as it was solely on the court procedures in England and Wales , my initial conclusion was that section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- requires an appellant 's notice to be both filed and served within the seven day period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	334	On reading in draft the impressive and cogent opinion of Lord Rodger , explaining why he had arrived at a different result , I realised that it was necessary for me comprehensively to reconsider the question . 	lord neuberger	lord rodger	ackn	0.6	NAN
86	335	For instance , I initially thought that the use of the expressions `` given '' and `` notice of appeal '' in section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- , could be contrasted with `` filed '' or `` served '' and `` appellant 's notice '' in CPR 52.4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	336	However , it now seems to me that the wording of the section is explained by the good sense of using expressions which are equally appropriate throughout the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	337	Having reconsidered the question on a less parochial basis than before , I have decided to adhere to my conclusion , for a number of reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	338	60 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	339	First , it appears clear that section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- requires one to refer to the relevant court rules to discover to whom `` a notice of appeal '' is required to be `` given '' : there is nowhere else to look . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	340	At least as I see it , if a notice of appeal is required by the relevant rules to be provided to more than one person , the use of the word `` given '' suggests that notice of an appeal must be provided to all such persons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	341	For instance , if there were two respondents , it would not have been `` given '' if it was served on only one of them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	342	As a matter of ordinary English , therefore , I consider that the rules in all three jurisdictions require a notice of appeal -LRB- i.e. the appellant 's notice in England and Wales , the note of appeal in Scotland , and the notice of motion in Northern Ireland to be `` given '' both to the representative of the authority -LRB- by serving -RRB- and to the relevant court office -LRB- by filing or lodging -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	343	61 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
86	344	Having seen in draft the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers , I should add that I agree that section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- contemplates that the `` rules of court '' will make specific provision for the `` giv -LSB- ing -RSB- of `` notice of an appeal '' . 	lord neuberger	lord phillips	ackn	0.7	NAN
86	344	Having seen in draft the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers , I should add that I agree that section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- contemplates that the `` rules of court '' will make specific provision for the `` giv -LSB- ing -RSB- of `` notice of an appeal '' . 	lord neuberger	lord phillips	ackn	0.7	NAN
86	345	This is what has been done in England and Wales through the provisions of para 22.6 A of the Practice Direction to CPR 52 , in Scotland by rule 34.3 of the Act of Adjournal , and in Northern Ireland by RSC Order 61A . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	346	62 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	347	Secondly , I believe that this conclusion is supported by the desirability for consistency throughout the United Kingdom , both in terms of practice and in terms of language . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	348	In practical terms , it would mean that , whether one is in Scotland or elsewhere in the United Kingdom , the same tasks have to be completed within the 7 day period , namely giving notice of appeal both to the representative of the relevant authority and to the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	349	It also means that any differences relating to time of service between the rules in the three jurisdictions will be over-ridden , thereby ensuring UK-wide consistency on initiating an appeal under the 2003 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	350	Accordingly , if a prospective appellant looks at para 26A of the Practice Direction , rule 34.3 of the Act of Adjournal , or Order 61 rule 3 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Northern Irish RSC , he or she should get the same answer : the notice of appeal must be both served and filed or lodged within the 7day period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	351	63 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	352	So far as linguistic consistency is concerned , it would be a little odd if `` given '' meant `` filed '' or `` entered '' -LRB- at the appropriate court office -RRB- in England and Wales and in Northern Ireland , but `` served '' -LRB- on the representative of the authority -RRB- in Scotland . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	353	Such a result is not , of course , impossible , but it appears to me to represent a more logically satisfactory outcome if `` given '' in section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- means both `` filed '' -LRB- or `` lodged '' or `` entered '' , which are the same thing in Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively -RRB- and `` served '' in all three jurisdictions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	354	64 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	355	I had initially also thought it significant that section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- refers to notice of `` an '' appeal being given . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	356	That suggested to me that what must be done is to not merely to bring an appeal but to give notice that it has been brought , which requires the appellant 's notice to be filed and served on the respondent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	357	However , the rather cavalier or indiscriminate way in which the 2003 Act appears to have referred to `` notice of an appeal '' and `` a notice of appeal '' , as described by Lord Rodger , now persuades me that the point has no force : it attributes an unwarranted degree of subtlety to the draftsman of the Act . 	lord neuberger	lord rodger	partagr	0.7	NAN
86	358	65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	359	Thirdly , however , I consider that there is a significant contrast between `` an appeal '' being `` brought '' in section 26 -LRB- 3 -RRB- , and `` -LSB- n -RSB- otice of an appeal '' being `` given '' in section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	360	The different language used in the two adjoining subsections suggests that two different concepts are envisaged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	361	If the latter expression was intended to refer only to the filing -LRB- or , in Scotland and Northern Ireland , only to the lodging or entering -RRB- of an appeal notice , it is hard to see why it did not begin `` An appeal under this section must be brought ... '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	362	In other words , the contrast with section 26 -LRB- 3 -RRB- suggests that section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- is concentrating on the giving of the notice of appeal to all those to whom it has to be given - namely the authority and the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	363	66 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	364	Fourthly , there are practical considerations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	365	The structure of Part 1 envisages a relatively strict and tight timetable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	366	This is appropriate , not merely for the benefit of the person against whom a warrant is issued , but also in the light of the Framework Decision , which was intended to streamline the surrender procedures referred to in its title . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	367	Thus , art 17 requires a European arrest warrant to `` be dealt with and executed as a matter of urgency '' , and it then identifies specific , and pretty short , time limits -LRB- and see also art 23 , which requires surrender `` as soon as possible '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	368	This is consistent with a tight timetable for appealing , which tends to imply that the time limit in section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- includes both filing and service of the notice of appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	369	67 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	370	This point is reinforced by consideration of section 35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	371	The provisions of section 35 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , -LRB- 3 -RRB- and -LRB- 4 -RRB- mean that the consequence of not giving a notice of an appeal within the time prescribed by section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- is that the extradition must take place very promptly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	372	Lord Phillips pointed out in argument , if section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- only requires the appellant 's notice to be filed within the 7 days referred to , then there is no clear and immediate sanction for failing to serve the appellant 's notice on the authority . 	lord neuberger	lord phillips	partagr	0.7	NAN
86	373	In England and Wales , one would be thrown back on CPR 52.4 -LRB- 3 -RRB- , and if its requirements are not met , there would be likely to be delays due to consequential applications and arguments resulting from non-compliance with that rule . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	374	68 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	375	Fifthly , quite apart from this , if section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- does not extend to service of the notice of appeal in England and Wales and in Northern Ireland , the authority seeking to enforce the warrant may well assume that section 35 , with its very tight time limit in subsection -LRB- 4 -RRB- , has been triggered in circumstances where it has not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	376	This is because , if section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- only extends to filing an appeal notice , SOCA may be unaware that an appeal has been brought within the prescribed time , and will therefore proceed promptly with the extradition - especially in the light of section 35 -LRB- 5 -RRB- - when , in fact it would be inappropriate to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	377	It is no doubt true that , in many cases , SOCA will have been informally alerted to the probability of an appeal , and , indeed , that SOCA can check whether an appeal has been brought . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	378	However , those factors do not seem to me to meet the force of the point that section 35 does not sit easily with the notion that section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- applies only to filing an appeal , and not to serving the appellant 's notice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	379	69 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	380	I turn to consider the arguments which have been raised the other way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	381	First , reliance is placed on the Explanatory Notes to the 2003 Act , which , in para 76 , refer to section 26 and state that `` notice of an appeal must be given to the High Court within 7 days of the extradition order being made by the judge -LRB- subsection -LRB- 4 -RRB- -RRB- . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	382	The function of Explanatory Notes was discussed by Lord Steyn in Westminster City Council v National Asylum Support Services -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 WLR 2956 , paras 5 and 6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	383	It seems to me that they are of no real assistance in the present context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	384	If my opinion as to the meaning of section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- is correct , the Notes are not inaccurate , but merely incomplete . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	385	Given that their function was to `` assist the reader in understanding the Act '' -LRB- to quote from the first paragraph of the Notes -RRB- , not to give guidance as to the details of the procedures it requires , I can not accept that they assist here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	386	Further , I note that para 22.6 A of the Practice Direction to CPR 52 , which is concerned with appeals under the 2003 Act , states in sub-para -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- , that `` the appellant 's notice must be filed and served before the expiry of 7 days '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	387	While that direction can not determine the meaning of section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- , it is of no less significance than the Explanatory Notes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	388	70 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	389	It was also contended that , if section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- applied to service of the appellant 's notice , it would lead to difficulties under sections 41 and 42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	390	I do not see that . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	391	If section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- does so apply , there is no `` pending '' appeal unless and until the notice is served in time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	392	It was also claimed that it would be inconvenient if section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- referred to two events , rather than one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	393	In my view , there is noting in that : it requires filing and then service , so , in practice , it logically can be treated as only referring to service . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	394	It was also said to be rather harsh if there is a 7-day time limit under section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- for service , particularly as some people who wish to rely on the right of appeal may have limited English and may be incarcerated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	395	But , on any view , there is such a time limit for filing , and it is not greatly different if it also applies to service . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
86	396	In any event , an identical time limit applies equally , by virtue of section 28 -LRB- 5 -RRB- , to a case where the appeal is against a refusal to extradite . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	397	71 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	398	It was also suggested that the fact that the legislature has not thought it appropriate to include a timetable for what happens after a notice of appeal assists the view that section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- does not , in England and Wales , require service , as well as filing , to be effected within the 7 days .

86	399	On any view , the requirements of section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- only apply to a certain point , following which it was no doubt assumed that the framers of the rules of court in the three UK jurisdictions would prescribe an appropriately strict procedural time-scale . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	400	I do not see how that provides much assistance when it comes to identifying the precise point at which the reach of the section ends . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	401	72 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	402	For these reasons , I conclude that an appellant 's notice must be served , as well as filed , within the 7-day period referred to in section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	403	As for section 103 -LRB- 9 -RRB- , it appears to me that , for substantially the same reasons , it requires an appellant 's notice to be served within the 14-day period to which it refers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	404	It is true that the Framework Directive forms no part of the background to part 2 , and that the statutory time-table of Part 2 is somewhat less tight than that of Part 1 , but those two factors do not even get near justifying a different conclusion as to the meaning of section 103 -LRB- 9 -RRB- from that which I have reached in relation to the meaning of section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	405	Can the court extend the time for filing or for service ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	406	73 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	407	The second question of principle is whether there is any basis on which the court could extend time for filing or service under sections 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- and 103 -LRB- 9 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	408	Again , I shall deal first with the position under section 26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	409	74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	410	On the face of it , at any rate , there is a clear and unqualified statutory time limit , namely 7 days , and there would therefore seem to be no basis upon which it could be extended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	411	In that connection , viewed from the English and Welsh perspective , I would refer to the CPR , which contain provisions whereby the court can extend time for the taking of any step , under CPR 3.1 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- , can make an order remedying any error of procedure , under CPR 3.10 , or can make an order dispensing with service of documents , under CPR 6.9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	412	However , these powers can not be invoked to extend a statutory time limit or to avoid service required by statute , unless of course , the statute so provides . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	413	Apart from being correct as a matter of principle , this conclusion follows from CPR 3.2 -LRB- a -RRB- which refers to time limits in `` any rule , practice direction or court order '' , and from CPR 6.1 -LRB- a -RRB- states that the rules in CPR 6 apply , `` except where any other enactment ... makes a different provision '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	414	75 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	415	Accordingly , it would be necessary to find some statutory basis for the court having power to extend time , or indeed to dispense with the service which section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- requires . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	416	The only arguable such basis is to be found in the words `` in accordance with the rules of court '' , which , it is contended , incorporate the various provisions of the CPR to which I have just referred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	417	I can not accept that argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	418	First , the way in which the subsection is linguistically structured appears to me to mean that those words govern the way in which `` notice of an appeal '' is to be `` given '' , not the time within which such notice is to be given , which is dictated by the closing part of the subsection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	419	76 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	420	Secondly , I consider that the argument that time under section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- can be extended pursuant to the CPR runs into difficulties with section 35 , which is entitled `` Extradition where there is no appeal '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	421	As already mentioned , the provisions of that section require the extradition process to be resumed and completed within a tight time-table following a decision of the District Judge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	422	Section 35 -LRB- 6 -RRB- is clear : the process must be resumed and completed , not merely promptly , but without regard to the possibility of any extensions of time which might otherwise be granted under the relevant rules of court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	423	As I see it , the effect of section 35 -LRB- 6 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- is that an appeal can only be validly brought if the time limits in section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- are strictly complied with . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	424	The notion that the court could extend time would mean either that section 36 -LRB- 6 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- had no effect or that the legislature contemplated that the court could grant an extension of time , which would render an appeal of academic interest only , because , by the time the appeal had been heard , the extradition would have been completed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	425	Neither of those possibilities seems to me to be acceptable , in the light of the wording of section 36 -LRB- 6 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- , common sense , and the title to the section . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	426	77 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	427	Section 35 -LRB- 6 -RRB- was relied on to support the opposite contention , on the basis that , read literally , para -LRB- a -RRB- appears to imply that the court would have power to extend time for service of a notice of appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	428	However , not only does this seem inconsistent with the effect of section 36 as a whole , as just explained , but there is also the point that para -LRB- b -RRB- is something of a puzzle on any view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	429	Once the appeal process is on foot , the need for an extension of time to take a procedural step would be irrelevant , and if the appeal process was not on foot in time , para -LRB- a -RRB- would be the relevant provision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	430	The least unsatisfactory analysis of section 35 -LRB- 6 -RRB- appears to me to be as follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	431	Para -LRB- a -RRB- was added as a precautionary provision to emphasise that , if the court would otherwise have any powers to extend time , such an extension could not be relied on by an appellant , or would-be appellant , as it would undermine the time-table laid down in section 35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	432	As to para -LRB- b -RRB- , it seems to have been added out of what Lord Rodger has characterised as hyper-precaution , for the same reason . 	lord neuberger	lord rodger	partagr	0.8	NAN
86	433	78 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	434	It is true that the Practice Direction to CPR 52 , and the prescribed form of the notice of appeal both suggest that the court 's powers to extend time under the CPR apply to the appeal process . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	435	As a general proposition this is of course , true , but it does not follow that the draftsman of those documents considered , let alone was stating , that the court must have such power in relation to every type of appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	436	In any event , CPR 52.1 -LRB- 4 -RRB- make it clear that the provisions of CPR 52 are `` subject to any rule , enactment or practice direction which sets out special provisions with regard to any particular category of appeal '' , and the Practice Direction is brought into effect through CPR 52.2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	437	79 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	438	The Divisional Court in the Moulai appeal thought that the court could nonetheless dispense with service of the appeal notice under CPR 6.9 -LRB- although they declined to make such an order in the event -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	439	I do not agree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	440	If , as I have concluded , section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- requires the appellant 's notice to be filed and served within seven days , the court can no more make an order dispensing with service than it can extend the time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	441	This conclusion , arrived at in a case where the dispensing of service is being sought to avoid having to serve at all or to avoid the 7-day time limit , does not preclude the possibility of the court making an order for substituted service in appropriate cases under the 2003 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	442	Indeed , on exceptional facts -LRB- e.g. where the respondent was evading service -RRB- , the court might well order that service could be effected in a way that may well lead to the notice not being received by the respondent within the 7-day period , or even - conceivably - at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	443	80 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	444	For these reasons , I consider that it is not open to the court to extend time under section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- or to dispense with service of the notice of appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	445	For the same reasons , I reach the same conclusion in relation to section 103 -LRB- 9 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	446	Service at the end of the 7 or 14 days 81 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	447	Both filing and service of documents often occur towards the last minute , and this is particularly likely in cases where the time for filing and service is short . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	448	Two questions of principle arise in connection with this practical problem in relation to the time limits in sections 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- and 103 -LRB- 9 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
86	449	The first is whether the provisions of CPR 6.7 , which is concerned with deemed service , are applicable to those time limits . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	450	Thus , under the rules as they were at the time of the instant appeals , a document transmitted by fax after 4.00 pm was deemed to have been served `` on the business day after the day on which it is transmitted '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	451	Such deeming provisions have been consistently held to be irrebuttable - see e.g. Anderton v Clwyd County Council -LSB- 2002 -RSB- EWCA -LRB- Civ -RRB- 933 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1WLR 3174 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	452	In these appeals , it appears to have been generally assumed that these provisions govern the question of when a notice of appeal is treated as having been `` given '' under sections 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- and 103 -LRB- 9 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	453	82 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	454	In my view , that general assumption is wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	455	Section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- requires the appellant 's notice to be issued and served within 7 days , and I can see no warrant for the CPR being invoked to cut down that period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	456	If a statute permits something to be done within a specific period , it is hard to see how that period can be cut down by subordinate legislation , as a matter of principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	457	In relation to the first two points of principle raised by these appeals , it is part of the Prosecutor 's case , indeed it is part of my reasoning , that the reference to rules of court in the section govern the manner , not the time , of service . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	458	In these circumstances , it is particularly hard to see how invocation of provisions of the CPR can be justified in order to curtail that period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	459	The point is reinforced by practical considerations : the 7 day period laid down by section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- is short , and it does not seem very fair to cut it down , even if only by a few hours . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	460	Although the 14 days permitted by section 103 -LRB- 9 -RRB- is somewhat longer , the same reasoning applies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	461	83 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	462	Another point which arises is what happens if it is impossible to give notice on , or during the final part of , the last day . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	463	For instance , in relation to filing , the Court Office may be closed on the last day because it is Christmas Day or another Bank Holiday , and the Court office will be closed at some point in the late afternoon on the last day . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	464	Equally , the respondent 's office may be closed for the same reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	465	84 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	466	Where the requisite recipient 's office is closed during the whole of the last day , I consider that the notice will be validly filed or served if it is given at any time during the first succeeding day on which the office is open -LRB- i.e. the next business day -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	467	So if the final day for giving a notice of appeal would otherwise be Christmas Day , filing or service can validly be effected on the 27th December -LRB- unless it is a weekend , in which case it would be the following Monday -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	468	This conclusion accords with that reached in Pritam Kaur v S Russell & Sons Ltd -LSB- 1973 -RSB- 1 QB 336 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	469	As Lord Denning MR said at 349E , `` when a time is prescribed by statute for doing any act , and that act can only be done if the court office is open on the day when time expires , then , if it turns out ... that the day is a Sunday or other dies non , the time is extended until the next day on which the court office is open '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	470	I agree , and I can see no reason not to apply the same principle to service on a respondent in relation to the respondent 's office . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	471	The fact that fax transmission can be effected at any time does not cause me to reconsider that conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	472	85 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	473	It might be argued that it follows from this that time should be similarly extended to the next business day , in cases where , even if only for a few hours , the required recipient 's office is closed before midnight on the final day -LRB- as will always be true of the court , and will almost always be true of any other recipient -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	474	In my opinion , while there is a real argument based on consistency to support such a proposition , it is not correct , at least where the office in question is open during normal hours . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	475	While there is no reason to deprive an appellant of his full statutory 7 or 14 days , if , for instance he transmits his notice of appeal by fax , or even if he posts the notice through a letter box in the door of the respondent 's office , just before midnight on the last day for service , it does not follow that he should have cause for complaint if he can not file the notice at the court office , or serve it on the respondent in person , outside normal office hours . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	476	I believe that this conclusion is consistent with the law as it is understood in relation to time limits for filing and service , when it comes to the operation of the Limitation Act 1980 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	477	Lofti Moulai v Deputy Public Prosecutor in Creteil , France 86 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	478	On 8 October 2007 , the Deputy Public Prosecutor -LRB- `` the Prosecutor '' -RRB- in Creteil , France -LRB- a Category 1 territory -RRB- issued a European Arrest Warrant for the arrest and extradition of Mr Moulai , on the basis that he had been convicted in his absence on 4 October 2004 for the misappropriation of motor vehicles , and sentenced to 5 years imprisonment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	479	The warrant was duly received by SOCA , who , on 10 October 2007 , certified the warrant in accordance with section 2 -LRB- 7 -RRB- and -LRB- 8 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

86	482	Mr Moulai decided to appeal against that decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	483	His appellant 's notice was duly filed in the office of the Administrative Court -LRB- part of the High Court -RRB- at 3.45 in the afternoon of 20 March 2008 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

86	485	The Prosecutor contended that the service was out of time , and that the appeal was accordingly ineffective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	486	Collins J directed that this point be determined as a preliminary issue , which was duly decided on 9 May 2008 , by the Divisional Court -LRB- Hooper LJ and Maddison J -RRB- , -LSB- 2008 -RSB- EWHC 1024 -LRB- Admin -RRB- -LSB- 2008 -RSB- 3 All E R 226 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	487	88 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	488	The Divisional Court held that -LRB- i -RRB- section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- required the appellant 's notice to have been filed , but not served , within 7 days of 14 March 2008 ; although -LRB- ii -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- if section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- does require service within the 7 days , CPR 6.7 applied and a document served by fax after 4.00 pm must be deemed to have been served on the following working day , so Mr Moulai 's notice was served a day late ; but -LRB- ii -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- time for service could be extended under CPR 3.1 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- , and in the circumstances it should be so extended .

86	489	The Prosecutor now appeals to your Lordships ' House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	490	89 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	491	For the reasons already given , I consider that the Divisional Court was wrong on point -LRB- i -RRB- , and , if it was right on point -LRB- ii -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- , it had no jurisdiction to extend time under point -LRB- ii -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	492	However , I would uphold the decision that Mr Moulai 's appeal to the High Court can proceed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	493	This is because I do not consider that the Divisional Court was wrong on point -LRB- ii -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	494	Section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- requires the appellant 's notice to be issued and served within 7 days , and , as explained above , I can see no warrant for the CPR being invoked to cut down that period , even if only by a few hours . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	495	90 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	496	In my view , the service of the appellant 's notice on the respondent at its proper address before midnight on the 20 March 2008 means that the `` notice of -LSB- his -RSB- appeal was given '' by Mr Moulai within the 7 day period required by section 26 -LRB- 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

86	498	Vullnet Mucelli v The Government of the Republic of Albania 91 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	499	After allegedly committing a murder in Albania -LRB- a Category 2 territory under the 2003 Act -RRB- in 1997 , Mr Mucelli fled the country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
86	500	In October 1998 , he was tried and convicted of the murder , in his absence , and he was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

86	502	On 4 June 2007 , after a hearing , the District Judge decided to send the case to the Secretary of State for a decision whether Mr Mucelli should be extradited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
86	503	On 18 July 2007 , the Secretary of State decided to order extradition , and informed Mr Mucelli -LRB- who was in prison at the time -RRB- and his solicitors , a couple of days later . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
86	504	Mr Mucelli instructed his solicitors to appeal ; they filed a notice of appeal at the High Court on 31 July 2007 , within the 14 day period laid down by section 103 -LRB- 9 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN

86	507	The Divisional Court -LRB- Richards LJ and Aikens J -RRB- held that -LRB- i -RRB- the appellant 's notice had to be served , as well as filed , within 14 days under section 103 -LRB- 9 -RRB- , -LRB- ii -RRB- the court could not extend time for service ; -LRB- iii -RRB- although the court had power to dispense with service , it would not do so in the instant case .

86	509	For reasons already given , I consider that the Divisional Court was right on points -LRB- i -RRB- and -LRB- ii -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
86	510	Although they were also , in my view , right not to dispense with service , they were wrong , also for reasons I have given , in thinking that they had power to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
86	511	93 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
86	512	The Divisional Court expressed doubts -LRB- in paras 23 to 27 of Richards LJ 's judgment -RRB- as to whether Mr Mucelli would get a retrial , or an appeal equivalent to a rehearing , if he was sent back to Albania , as required by section 85 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
86	513	It is not entirely clear to me what purpose those remarks were intended to serve , given the court 's conclusion that Mr Mucelli 's notice of appeal had been served out of time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
86	514	However , as the point was discussed by the Divisional Court , it is right briefly to deal with it , as otherwise the outcome of Mr Mucelli 's appeal might appear a little unsatisfactory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
86	515	94 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
86	516	The Divisional Court concluded that the evidence before it disclosed `` too many open ends and insufficient clarity '' for it to be satisfied that , if he returned to Albania , Mr Mucelli would be retried , or would be entitled to appeal against his conviction and sentence , in a form which would amount to a retrial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
86	517	In reaching this conclusion , the court followed the earlier Divisional Court decision in Government of Albania v Bleta -LSB- 2005 -RSB- EWHC 475 -LRB- Admin -RRB- , -LSB- 2005 -RSB- 3 All ER 351 , where very similar evidence as to the Albanian law and practice was put before the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
86	518	However , since those two decisions , there has been a further decision of the Divisional Court , Bogdani v Government of Albania -LSB- 2008 -RSB- EWHC 2065 -LRB- Admin -RRB- , in which , on the basis of `` further material evidence '' , the court concluded that `` the Government of Albania in this case have established the existence of legal protection for a returning person such as satisfies the provisions of section 85 -LRB- 3 -RRB- '' - see para 53 of the judgment of Pill LJ , who also gave the judgment in Bleta .

86	521	The Government of Albania has applied to put the same `` further material evidence '' before your Lordships . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
86	522	In the light of the conclusion that Mr Mucelli 's appeal is irredeemably out of time , it is not strictly necessary to deal with that application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
86	523	It is right to say , however , that , had the appeal been capable of being pursued , I think the right course would have been to remit this appeal to the High Court with a direction that the Albanian Government should be permitted to adduce this further evidence , and that Mr Mucelli should be entitled to put in evidence in reply , if so advised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
86	524	However , as the appeal can not be pursued , it is appropriate simply to say that I very much doubt that the Divisional Court in this case would have reached the same conclusion on the section 85 issue that it did reach , had it seen the further evidence which was before the Court in Bogdani -LSB- 2008 -RSB- EWHC 2065 -LRB- Admin -RRB- .
