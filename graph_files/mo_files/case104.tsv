104	11	I have studied carefully the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Hope of Craighead and Rodger of Earlsferry and they have satisfied me that the interlocutor pronounced by the Extra Division was in accordance with the law of Scotland . 	lord hoffmann	lord hope	ackn	0	lord hope, lord rodger

104	11	I have studied carefully the opinions of my noble and learned friends Lord Hope of Craighead and Rodger of Earlsferry and they have satisfied me that the interlocutor pronounced by the Extra Division was in accordance with the law of Scotland . 	lord hoffmann	lord rodger	fullagr	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	12	The appeal must therefore be refused . 	lord hoffmann	self	outcome	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	13	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	14	I am however by no means satisfied that this state of the law is either desirable or a necessary consequence of fundamental principles of Scots law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	15	In Heritable Reversionary Company Ltd v Millar -LRB- 1892 -RRB- 19 R -LRB- HL -RRB- 43 , 52 Lord Macnaughten began his opinion with the words : `` 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	16	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	17	if this House were compelled to uphold the decision under appeal , I rather think I should be inclined to doubt whether the law of bankruptcy in Scotland was in a condition altogether satisfactory . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	18	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	19	In the present case , I do feel compelled to uphold the decision of the Extra Division but share the view of its consequences which Lord Macnaughten expressed with such studied understatement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	20	It results in the creditors of Mrs Burnett being unjustly enriched at the expense of the Rev. and Mrs Grainger and I can see no compelling ground of logic or policy which justifies such a result . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	21	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	22	The unjust enrichment arises from the fact that the mistake of the Graingers in failing to record the disposition in their favour before the permanent trustee means that they are not only unable to assert title to the flat -LRB- a consequence which might have been reasonable if the contract had remained uncompleted -RRB- but that the permanent trustee is also entitled to keep the money they paid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	23	To say that this is a consequence of their own fault is in my opinion no answer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	24	Mistake is generally regarded as a ground for relief against unjust enrichment , not a reason why the victim should have to suffer the consequences of an error which has caused no prejudice to anyone else . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	25	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	26	Two reasons of policy and principle are put forward to justify the rule ; the strict division in Scots law between real and personal rights and the importance of maintaining the integrity of the register . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	27	But both of these principles have in the past been compromised in cases in which justice was thought to require it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	28	The right of recovery of an owner whose property has been obtained by fraud and the right of a beneficiary under a trust are personal rights , but Scots law has had no difficulty in holding that a disponee of heritable estate takes subject to such rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	29	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	30	As for the conclusiveness of the register , it is said that unless the title acquired by the trustee in sequestration defeats the claims of a purchaser who has paid for the property and received an executed disposition , no purchaser from a trustee could know for certain that property in his name was not subject to a prior unrecorded disposition to a purchaser . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	31	So be it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	32	But neither can he know whether it was subject to a prior declaration of trust , and for more than a century it has been settled that trust property does not pass to the trustee in sequestration , even if he has recorded a notice of title . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	33	No one seems to have found this a great inconvenience . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	34	Indeed , Mr Hodge for the respondent accepted that the position would have been altogether different if the disposition to the Graingers had included the words `` And pending the recording of this disposition , I hereby declare myself trustee of the subject hereby disponed for the purchasers absolutely . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	35	Such a declaration , accompanied by delivery of the disposition to the purchasers , would appear to me to satisfy the requirements of a declaration of trust stated by Lord Reid in Allan 's Trs v Lord Advocate 1971 SC -LRB- HL -RRB- 45 , 54 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	36	But the existence of the declaration would be equally unknown to any subsequent purchaser from the trustee in sequestration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	37	It is a strange form of conclusiveness that can be so easily defeated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	38	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	39	I agree with my noble and learned friends that the decision in Sharp v Thomson 1997 SC -LRB- HL -RRB- 66 is distinguishable . 	lord hoffmann	lord hope	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	39	I agree with my noble and learned friends that the decision in Sharp v Thomson 1997 SC -LRB- HL -RRB- 66 is distinguishable . 	lord hoffmann	lord rodger	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	40	But , for the reasons I have given , I think it would have been better if it had not been necessary to distinguish it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	41	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	42	LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	43	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	44	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	45	I have had the advantage of studying in draft the speech which has been prepared by my noble and learned friend Lord Rodger of Earlsferry . 	lord hope	lord rodger	ackn	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	46	I am in full agreement with it . 	lord hope	lord rodger	fullagr	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	47	In view of the importance of the case however , I should like to add a few words of my own to explain why I too would affirm the order of the sheriff granting decree in terms of the second crave of the initial writ . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	48	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	49	This exceptional and troublesome case presents itself at first sight as a competition between two parties only . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	50	On the one hand there are the appellants , to whom in implement of missives of sale a disposition of the subjects was delivered by Mrs Burnett 's solicitors in exchange for the payment of the purchase price . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	51	On the other there is the respondent , the permanent trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	52	He was aware that the subjects had been disponed to the appellants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	53	But he seeks to rely on the fact that when he recorded his notice of title to the subjects , for which he paid nothing , he came first in the race to the register . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	54	This simple view of the case tends to suggest that the situation in which the appellants now find themselves is unfair . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	55	They paid the price for the subjects to which they obtained entry in exchange for delivery of the disposition on the date of settlement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	56	They are now being told that the subjects are vested in the respondent and that they can no longer acquire a good title to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	57	In the result they have been deprived of their right to become the owners of the subjects , and they have lost the price which they paid for them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	58	This is not something that could have happened while Mrs Burnett remained solvent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope, lord rodger
104	59	Why then , it is asked , should the respondent be able to deprive them of that right in his capacity as the permanent trustee in Mrs Burnett 's bankruptcy ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	60	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	61	This view of the case however is only one part of a much more complex story . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	62	The full details have not been revealed to us . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	63	We know little of the background . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	64	But we do know that the permanent trustee acts under the statute for each and every one of Mrs Burnett 's creditors , not for himself as an individual : Stewart v Jarvie , 1938 SC 309 , 316 , per Lord Moncrieff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	65	So the contest is more accurately seen as one between the appellants and the general body of Mrs Burnett 's creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	66	It is on their behalf that the respondent is claiming to be entitled to the subjects which the appellants bought from her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	67	And it seems likely that the creditors , or some of them , were already active in seeking to protect their position before the date of sequestration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	68	They were entitled to do this by means of diligences against her moveable and heritable property , unaffected by any personal obligations that she may have entered into subsequently . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	69	One of the effects of a sequestration is to equalise the rights of creditors who have executed diligence : section 37 of the Bankruptcy -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1985 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	70	Another is that it places the permanent trustee , on behalf of all the creditors , in the position of an adjudging creditor with respect to the debtor 's heritable property : section 31 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- of the 1985 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	71	Accordingly a more complete picture of the contest , and a guide to its resolution in a way that is consistent with Scots property law , may be obtained by examining the range of remedies that are available to creditors in general before the ultimate remedy of sequestration is resorted to and the way in which , in the event of a sequestration , the Act seeks to protect their rights as creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	72	The passing of ownership : the real right 12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	73	At the heart of Scots property law , as Professor Burns points out in the opening sentence of the chapter on infeftment in his Handbook on Conveyancing , 5th ed -LRB- 1938 -RRB- , p 160 , lies the maxim traditionibus , non nudis pactis , transferuntur rerum dominia . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	74	The adoption of this rule of the Roman law as part of Scots law can be traced at least as far back as Stair , The Institutions of the Law of Scotland -LRB- 1693 edition -RRB- , III ii 5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	75	He accepts that some kind of possession is needed to accomplish real rights , so that thereby they may be `` more manifest and sure '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	76	Erskine , An Institute of the Law of Scotland -LRB- Nicholson 's edition -RRB- , II i 18 too acknowledges the need for `` greater certainty '' and for the delivery of possession , or at least some public act , `` by which it may appear that the former proprietor has given up his right . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	77	A statutory exception to what is required to transfer property in corporeal moveables applies in the case of sale . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	78	The property in goods passes by force of the contract of sale independent of delivery : Sale of Goods Act 1979 , sections 17 and 18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	79	But the rule that delivery is required to transfer ownership has always applied , and continues to apply , to all transactions relating to heritable property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	80	Burns , using language appropriate to the feudal system of land tenure with which he was familiar , explains at p 160 how the principle operates : `` To clothe the feuar with a real right in the lands he required , and still requires , more than the charter ; he requires delivery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	81	By that is meant delivery , not of the charter -LRB- though that also is necessary -RRB- , but of the lands . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	82	Such delivery is infeftment . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	83	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	84	Section 1 of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 2000 is , as its name indicates , will abolish the system of feudal tenure with effect from the appointed day . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	85	There is to be introduced instead the new system of ownership of land which is described in section 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	86	Prior to the appointed day entry with the feudal superior , known as infeftment , will still be required to vest the real right to the purchaser . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	87	This is the system which was in force when the appellants entered into their contract to purchase the subjects from Mrs Burnett . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	88	The methods by which infeftment is achieved have been amended step by step by the conveyancing statutes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	89	The earlier methods depended on symbolical delivery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	90	Physical occupation of the subjects was not required , nor was physical occupation sufficient to constitute infeftment with the superior . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	91	By section 1 of the Infeftment Act 1845 however it was provided that it was no longer to be necessary to proceed to the lands in which sasine was to be given but that sasine could be obtained and infeftment given by recording an instrument of sasine in the General Register of Sasines . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	92	The process of registration was simplified by section 15 of the Titles to Land Consolidation -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1868 , which provides that an instrument of sasine is no longer necessary and that it shall be competent and sufficient to record the conveyance or deed itself in the appropriate register . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	93	It was further simplified by section 4 of the Conveyancing -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1924 , which provides that a person having a right to property by a title which has not been completed by recording may complete his title by recording a notice of title deducing his title from the person who was last infeft . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	94	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	95	When section 4 of the 2000 Act comes into force , ownership of land will pass on registration in the Land Register of Scotland where a transfer the land is registrable under the Land Registration -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1979 , or in any other case on the recording of a conveyance of land in the General Register of Sasines . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	96	The new system is , in effect , the same as the old after stripping out from it the feudal element . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	97	In modern practice , when there is a sale of heritable property , the disposition is the deed by which the subsisting interest in the land is transferred from the old to the new heritable proprietor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	98	Registration in the Land Register of Scotland under the Land Registration -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1979 has taken the place of the final step , which it was always necessary to take to transfer the real right , of symbolical delivery of the land by sasine and the recording of a notarial instrument or its modern equivalents in the General Register of Sasines . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	99	Section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1979 Act provides that registration shall have the effect of vesting in the person registered as entitled to the registered interest a real right in the land in so far as the right is capable of being vested as a real right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	100	It preserves the rule that delivery of the disposition does not of itself transfer the real right in the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	101	That rule applies to every transaction by which ownership in land is passed from one person to another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	102	It is not confined to sale , although it is in contracts for the sale of the land that most transactions which lead to the transfer of ownership in land have their origin . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	103	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	104	It can be seen that none of the changes effected by the conveyancing statutes have departed from the essential principle that up to the moment of the purchaser 's infeftment the seller remained infeft with the superior and the holder of the real right in the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	105	The purchaser completed his title by recording the disposition in the General Register of Sasines : Craigie , Heritable Rights , 3rd edition -LRB- 1899 -RRB- , p 396 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	106	This was the act of infeftment which divested the person who was last infeft of the real right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	107	As Craigie , p 458 , explains : '' ... he who first completes the real right , or , in other words , he who first divests the person last infeft , has the preferable right to the lands . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	108	Up to that point the seller remained liable for payment of the feu-duties and the performance of the other obligations of the feu : Menzies , Lectures on Conveyancing -LRB- Sturrock 's edition , 1900 -RRB- , pp 814-815 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	109	Prior to the recording of the disposition in the register the right of the purchaser was a personal right to the lands only . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	110	Until section 22 of the 1868 Act was repealed by section 48 of and Schedule 11 , Part II to the Conveyancing -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1970 the right , being personal , was transmissible by assignation : Craigie , pp 458-461 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	111	It carried with it all the rights of an uninfeft proprietor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	112	But the right which the purchasers had was not a real right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	113	So it was ineffective as against any third party who was able to obtain infeftment with the superior before he did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	114	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	115	In the opinion which he prepared on behalf of the majority of the judges of the whole Court which was reported to this House in Young v Leith -LRB- 1847 -RRB- 9 D 932 , 937 , Lord Fullerton said : `` The proper object and effect of every valid seisin is to divest the granter of the heritable right , and to invest the grantee ... It is of the very essence of a real right , not only to found a preference against a less perfect right , but to prevent any third party from acquiring a perfect right to the lands , which most certainly an unregistered seisin does not . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	116	At p 938 he added this comment : `` In the same way , and on the same principle , the holder of a heritable bond , followed only by unregistered seisin , would fail in claiming a preference over personal creditors , because such creditors have the means of obtaining by adjudication a perfect right to the lands of the debtor . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	117	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	118	The effect of the provisions of the conveyancing statutes is that until the interest of the purchaser has been recorded or registered the seller remains vested in the real right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	119	His relationship with the purchaser is , of course , controlled by the rights and obligations which were created by their contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	120	When the disposition is delivered the general rule is that it becomes the sole measure of the contracting parties ' rights if there is a dispute about the subject to which right has been acquired by the purchaser : Orr v Mitchell -LRB- 1893 -RRB- 20 R -LRB- HL -RRB- 27 , 29 per Lord Watson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	121	The seller will usually have performed all the positive obligations arising from the contract of sale when the disposition is delivered to the purchaser on the date of settlement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	122	But that is not an end of their contractual relationship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	123	The seller remains bound not to derogate from his grant of the subjects as described in the dispositive clause . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	124	That is a matter of personal obligation , arising from the contract contained in the missives which he entered into with the purchaser . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	125	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	126	Baron Hume explains the distinction between the personal right and the real right from the point of view of the purchaser in this way in his Lectures -LRB- 1786-1822 -RRB- , vol II of the Stair Society edition , pp 2-3 : `` Those rights , again , that spring from a connection which is formed with an individual have ... a much more limited and uncertain operation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	127	In these , as in all other instances of right , there is to be sure a corresponding obligation somewhere ; but it lies in this case with that individual alone who has been applied to or bargained with as the means of getting at the thing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	128	He , to be sure , in return for what he has received , or in fulfilment of the expectation he has raised , is bound to make good his word , and put me in possession of the thing in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	129	But with respect to all the rest of the world , who have had no sort of concern with this bargain of mine , and are probably ignorant even of any such having been made ; I have no manner of claim nor bond upon them to repair my loss , or consider my disappointment . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	130	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	131	The rule that Scots law does not recognise a right which lies between a personal right on the one hand and a real right on the other applies to the relationship between the seller and the purchaser . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger

104	139	The seller of heritable property is prevented by his contract with the purchaser from granting new security rights over his property which will defeat the rights of the purchaser . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	140	But a creditor who holds no right in security granted to him by the debtor voluntarily may subsequently acquire the means of enforcing payment of his debt which is in the nature of a right in security by the use of diligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger

104	142	The preferences in favour of a creditor which arise from securities constituted by voluntary grant or by legal diligence depend on the principle that the creditor holds a real right in the property over which his security extends : Bell , Commentaries on the Law of Scotland -LRB- McLaren 's edition -RRB- , i , 711 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	143	In contrast to the grant of a right of security , which is a voluntary act which the debtor performs in favour of the creditor , the use of diligence does not require the co-operation of the debtor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	144	Diligence is the legal procedure by which a creditor attaches the property or person of his debtor , with the object of forcing him to appear in court to answer an action at the creditor 's instance , or to find security for implement of the judgment which may be pronounced against him in such an action , or to implement a judgment which has already been pronounced : Graham Stewart , Law of Diligence , p 1 .

104	146	Inhibition and arrestment respectively are prohibitory diligences against heritable and moveable property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	147	Their effect is to make the debtor 's property litigious , so as to prevent its voluntary alienation to the prejudice of the raiser of the action or the user of the diligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	148	The diligence of inhibition against heritable property renders the subject litigious as soon as notice of the diligence has appeared in the Register of Inhibitions and Adjudications kept under section 44 of the Conveyancing -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1924 , known as the Personal Register : Titles to Land Consolidation Act 1868 , section 155 .

104	150	The prohibition against voluntary alienations which arises from litigiosity is an incomplete diligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	151	To complete the diligence the creditor must acquire a title to the subjects affected by the prohibition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger

104	159	Section 62 of the 1868 Act , as substituted by section 62 of the Conveyancing -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1874 , now provides that a decree of adjudication shall be held equivalent to a conveyance of the lands , and that the creditor may complete infeftment by using the decree as a conveyance of the lands or as an assignation of an unrecorded conveyance .

104	164	Until a process of general sequestration or attachment was introduced by the Sequestration Act 1772 , there was no equivalent rule for determining priority between creditors who obtained a diligence against moveables : Bell , Commentaries , ii , 73-74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	165	The rule which was introduced by that Act was that no individual arrestment or poinding against moveables thirty days before sequestration was to have any preference . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	166	Provision was made for the conveyance of the bankrupt estate to a factor for its management and recovery on behalf of the whole body of creditors and for its equal and rateable distribution among them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger

104	168	It was not until the Bankruptcy -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1839 was enacted that the system which is to be found in its current form in the Bankruptcy -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1985 was made permanent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger

104	171	Parties contract with each other on the basis of what is published to all the world in the register . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	172	In practice a good marketable title with clear searches in both the Property Register and the Personal Register is demanded of the seller by the purchaser . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	173	In this way the purchaser obtains protection against all transactions which may have affected the property up to the date of settlement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	174	There is , inevitably , a gap in time between the date of presentation of a deed for recording the Personal and Property Registers and the date when it is recorded or registered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	175	A search which produces an adverse entry ex facie of the record , even if it relates to an inhibition which was laid on after the missives were entered into , is not a clear search : Dryburgh v Gordon -LRB- 1896 -RRB- 24 R 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	176	So it is the practice for a letter of obligation to be granted by the agent for the seller to the agent for the purchaser by which the granter of the letter makes himself personally liable to produce a clear search within a specified period after the date of settlement , usually one year , so long as the disposition is presented for recording or registration within a relatively short period .

104	177	The period specified in the letter of obligation referred to by the appellants in Answer 3 of the Closed Record was twenty-eight days . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	178	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	179	In practice the letter of obligation provides sufficient protection for the purchaser who presents his disposition for recording or registration with this period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	180	Its purpose is to cover the risk that , during the period between the interim report at the date of settlement and the recording of the disposition , a deed which adversely affects the purchaser 's interests may be recorded in the Register of Sasines or a diligence may be registered in the Personal Register . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	181	An inhibition laid on after missives have been concluded can not prevent the due implement of the contract of sale , as an inhibition strikes only at the personal and voluntary acts of the seller . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	182	But an inhibition which is laid on after the missives have been concluded but before the date of the disposition , apparently striking at the sale , may cause difficulty in a question with a subsequent purchaser : Henderson v Dawson -LRB- 1895 -RRB- 22 R 895 , 902 , per Lord McLaren . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	183	The protection which the letter of obligation provides flies off after the expiry of the period for the recording of the disposition which it specifies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger

104	185	As Bell , Commentaries , vol i , 21 , note 1 , explains , with reference to the case of Bell of Blackwoodhouse v Gartshore , 1737 M 2848 : `` any doubts which were entertained before the above decision are now held to be settled ; and according to the doctrine in this case of Bell , the law is laid down by Erskine , that no conveyance of a personal right to lands can so divest the disponer as to prevent him from granting a posterior deed that may , by prior sasine , be made the preferable .

104	186	A bona fide purchaser is protected by the principle of good faith against any subsequent purchaser of the land who , in the knowledge of the prior sale , wins the race to the register : Rodger -LRB- Builders -RRB- Ltd v Fawdry , 1950 SC 483 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	187	On the same principle , he is protected against an attempt by the seller to grant a subsequent standard security over the lands which he has purchased to a creditor who accepts the security in bad faith . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	188	But the general rule is that third parties are entitled to deal with a person who holds himself out as the owner of lands on the faith of the register . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	189	This rule applies not only to those who may wish to enter into voluntary transactions with the seller , but also - and here is the greater risk - to his creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	190	The only way in which the disponee can be sure of preventing a third party , such as an adjudging creditor , from acquiring a real right to the lands which will prevail against his right is by registration : Young v Leith -LRB- 1847 -RRB- 9 D 932 , 937 .

104	197	It may be either for debt or in implement of an obligation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	198	The purpose of the adjudication is to transfer a right of property in the subject adjudged to the creditor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	199	The act and warrant is a statutory adjudication . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	200	It is equivalent to a conveyance of the lands to the trustee , to which he may complete title by registration of the act and warrant as if it were a conveyance or by using it as an assignation of an unrecorded conveyance if the debtor 's title was uncompleted : section 31 -LRB- 3 -RRB- .

104	202	A decree of adjudication for payment and in security of debt is the penultimate step in the execution of diligence against heritable property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	203	The final step is the presentation of the decree for recording or registration in the appropriate register . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	204	The rule is that the creditor attaches the estate of the debtor by an adjudication tantum et tale as it stands vested in him , and subject to all the conditions and qualities legally attaching to it : Graham Stewart , pp 128 -LRB- arrestment -RRB- and 606 -LRB- adjudication -RRB- .

104	205	But this does not mean that the creditor is liable for any personal obligations of the debtor relating to the property which has been attached . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	206	What it means is that he takes the heritable estate in which the debtor was infeft , subject to no limitation or burden which does not appear on the face of the records , and his moveable estate under such conditions only as qualify his real right , but free from all his personal liabilities : Mansfield v Walker 's Trustees -LRB- 1833 -RRB- 11 S 813 , 822-823 in the opinion prepared for the majority by Lord Corehouse .

104	208	Bell , Commentaries , i , 299 , describes the rule more fully in this way : `` The only general doctrine which appears to be safe is , that in all competitions the right of the general body of creditors , or of an individual claiming a preference , is to be regulated strictly according to the criterion by which real right is contradistinguished from personal , unless it can be stated either , 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger

104	212	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	213	As Bell , Commentaries , i 301 , explains , the public registers have the effect of protecting both creditors and purchasers against such burdens and qualifications of the real right of a proprietor infeft as are not of the nature of a radical defect in the title . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	214	Personal qualifications which do not appear in the record are unavailing as real burdens on the property and are of no effect against third parties : `` The question , however , must always return to this , What was truly the extent of real right in the debtor ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	215	And although he may be under a relative personal obligation , the real right legally constituted is that only which his sasine bears , and of which it gives assurance to the public ; and accordingly , it has at last been held that such personal exceptions have no effect against creditors '' : Wylie v Duncan , 1803 , M 10269 .

104	216	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	217	Accordingly , it is no answer to a claim by a creditor who adjudges heritable property from his debtor that the debtor is subject to a personal obligation under an agreement entered into by him to convey that property to a third party acting in good faith and for full value . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	218	So long as the real right remains with the debtor , it is at risk of adjudication for payment and in security of debt at the instance of his creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger

104	225	In Heritable Reversionary Company Ltd v Millar -LRB- 1892 -RRB- 18 R 1166 , a decision of the Court of Session which was later to be reversed by this House , Lord McLaren delivered a powerful dissenting opinion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	226	He said at p 1173 that , in the case of a bankrupt trustee whose estate was to be divided among his creditors , the property available for distribution would be the property which he held in his own right and that on proof that any property vested in him was trust estate it ought to be struck out of the sequestration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	227	This , he explained , was the rule expressed in the maxim that creditors and adjudgers take the debtor 's estate tantum et tale as it stands in his person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	228	He distinguished the case of Wylie v Duncan 1803 M 10,269 , where the bankrupt was under an obligation to reconvey the property to the seller on demand , on the ground that that was not a case of a trust qualifying the title of the trustee but was a case where the bankrupt had purchased the estate `` out-and-out '' and that the obligation to reconvey was purely personal .

104	229	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	230	When the case reached the House of Lords , Lord Watson observed that the doctrine of tantum et tale was of very secondary importance in a case where the question was whether the subjects in question were the property of the bankrupt at all within the meaning of section 102 of the Bankruptcy -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1856 : -LRB- 1893 -RRB- 19 R -LRB- HL -RRB- 43 , 49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	231	The appellants had not recorded the back-bond or declaration of trust which they had received in respect of their loan of part of the purchase price , and the disposition which they had granted to the bankrupt was absolute and unqualified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	232	So the trust was latent , as it did not appear on the register . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	233	Nevertheless Lord Watson said that there was no doubt that the holder of the legal title was in reality a bare trustee , and that the person whom the whole beneficial interest belonged was the true owner : pp 46-47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	234	The effect of the trust was that the apparent title did not , in the ordinary or any true legal sense , make the land the property of the person who held the title : p 49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	235	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	236	But Lord Watson 's observation at p 48 that the doctrine of tantum et tale had no application to cases where the competition related , not to estate held by the bankrupt under a bare trust , but to estate of which he was the beneficial proprietor has to be read in its context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	237	He was careful on the same page to distinguish the cases of Mitchells v Fergusson , 1781 M 10,296 , Wylie v Duncan , 1803 M 10 , 269 and Mansfield v Walker 's Trustees -LRB- 1833 -RRB- 11 S 813 , on the ground that they were cases where the creditors who had completed a feudal title by adjudication to lands of which their debtor was the beneficial owner and were in competition with others who had prior but merely personal rights to demand a conveyance from him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	238	At p 51 he said : `` I have already stated what I believe to have been the import of the judgment in Wylie v Duncan and similar cases , and I have only to remark further , that a personal obligation to convey heritable estate , undertaken by one who is the beneficial as well as the feudal owner , does not , according to the law of Scotland , denude him of his beneficial interest , or confer upon the person to whom it was contracted either the character or the rights of a trust beneficiary .

104	247	In Mitchells v Fergusson , 1781 M 10,296 , on the other hand , the argument proceeded on the assumption that this obligation had been performed as the disposition had been delivered to Fergusson : see the report of the case in Ross 's Leading Cases , vol 3 , 120 , 122 , where the argument for the Mitchells -LRB- the adjudger -RRB- was that the nature of feudal rights was such that they could not be affected , qualified or burdened by any personal deed and that a conveyance , so long as it continued personal , did not divest the disponee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	248	The judges accepted this argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	249	Lord Braxfield in particular is reported at p 125 as saying that the reason why dispositions were not ordered to be recorded by the Act of 1661 was that they were `` mere personal deeds '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	250	In the report of the case in Hailes ' Decisions p 879 , 880 the words attributed to him in this passage of his opinion are `` Dispositions are not mentioned in the statute , for they do not affect the feudal right . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	251	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	252	According to the same report at p 880 Lord Gardenston said : `` I know no safety to the feudal law , unless you prefer infeftments ; for otherwise an imperfect right would be better than a complete one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	253	There is great danger in departing from this feudal principle , but none in adhering to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	254	The disponee is safe , unless he is supinely negligent ; for an adjudication can not be taken on a sudden , and without the knowledge of many . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	255	In other words , if I may paraphrase these observations , safety lies in infeftment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	256	It is up to the disponee , if he seeks safety , to present the deed for recording or registration in the appropriate register as soon as possible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	257	It does not require more than ordinary diligence on his part for this to be achieved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	258	Your Lordships were not referred to any case since that opinion was delivered which shows that Lord Gardenston 's assessment of the position was inaccurate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	259	In any event , as Bell , Commentaries , vol ii , 308 observes , any doubts that were cast on the soundness of that decision in Smith v Taylor , 18 December 1795 , were removed by the opinions delivered in Buchan v Farqhuarson , 1797 , M 2905 , in which Smith was disapproved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	260	It is a striking feature of the present case that there was a delay of some fourteen months before this step was taken on the appellants ' behalf by their solicitors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	261	Their counsel , Mr Gale QC , accepted that the delay in this case was exceptional . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger

104	263	As I read Lord Watson 's speech in Heritable Reversionary Company Ltd v Millar -LRB- 1893 -RRB- 19 R -LRB- HL -RRB- 43 , he was seeking to maintain the general rule laid down in Young v Leith that an obligation which is merely personal to the debtor and would not bind his creditors is not binding on the permanent trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	264	He referred to the obligation to convey . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	265	But it is the character of the obligation , not its content , that determines whether it binds the creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	266	The common thread that runs through all the authorities is that the right of the disponee remains a personal right until his title enters the register . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	267	Certainty is preferred to uncertainty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	268	The statutes , including the Bankruptcy Acts , have all been framed on the assumption that this is how the law of Scotland seeks to achieve a fair balance between the various competing interests that may arise where transactions are entered into relating to heritable property .

104	270	In Forbes 's Trustees v Macleod -LRB- 1898 -RRB- 25 R 1012 the second party was the trustee in the sequestration of a Mr Carrick , to whom a bond and disposition in security granted by a third party had been assigned in security of an advance which he had made to the trustees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	271	Mr Carrick 's title to the subjects appeared from the record to be unqualified , as the assignation to him was ex facie absolute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	272	But he acknowledged in a back letter that the assignation had been made to him in security of the advance , and he undertook to reconvey the bond when the debt had been repaid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	273	The rule that the creditors of the ex facie absolute proprietor could take no higher right than he himself possessed was applied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	274	As soon as the debt was paid , Mr Carrick ceased to have any pecuniary interest in the subjects . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	275	So there was nothing left for his creditors to attach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	276	His title was , as Lord McLaren put it at p 1015 , merely nominal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger

104	278	In Colquhouns ' Trustee v Campbell 's Trustees -LRB- 1902 -RRB- 4 F 739 a firm of law agents had failed to record two bonds and dispositions granted by the owner of a property in Glasgow in security of loans which their clients had made to him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	279	They then obtained and recorded an ex facie absolute disposition of the same subjects in their own name as security for debts owed by the owner to the firm . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	280	This was a fraudulent breach of trust . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	281	Lord Kinnear said at p 744 that the decision in Heritable Reversionary Company v Millar -LRB- 1893 -RRB- 19 R -LRB- HL -RRB- 43 showed that the estate must honestly belong to the bankrupt , and that the creditors can not enlarge the estate for distribution by adopting a fraud on the part of the bankrupt or doing something which would have been a fraud if it had been done by him when he was solvent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	282	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	283	These two cases , together with the Heritable Reversionary case , demonstrate how liberally , as Lord McLaren put it in Forbes 's Trustees v Macleod at p 1015 , the principle that creditors take the estate tantum et tale is applied in favour of the true owner against the creditors of a trustee or other person having a qualified title . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	284	But the situations with which they were dealing do not apply here , and Mr Gale did not seek to rely on them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	285	Was the property nevertheless held on trust ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	286	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	287	There is no doubt that Mrs Burnett was the beneficial owner of the property when she contracted to sell to the appellants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	288	Mr Gale accepted that the act of delivering the disposition to the appellants in exchange for the purchase price did not have the effect in Scots law of creating a trust over Mrs Burnett 's title to the property in favour of the appellants as trust beneficiaries . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	289	I think that he was right to concede this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	290	In Gibson v Hunter Home Designs Limited , 1976 SC 23 , the disposition had been executed but not delivered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	291	It was held that entry to the subjects and payment of the price , referable to the terms of the missives , did not instruct the existence of a trust pending delivery of the disposition to the purchaser . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	292	Lord President Emslie said at p 28 that there was no evidence whatsoever in that case of the constitution of a trust and that it was impossible to entertain the suggestion that as a result of the purchaser 's entry to the subjects and payment of the price a trust in his favour had come into existence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	293	I also think that Mr Gale was right not to attempt to draw any analogies from English law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope, lord rodger
104	294	In Allan 's Trustees v Lord Advocate , 1971 SC -LRB- HL -RRB- 45 , 53-54 , Lord Reid explained that it is not possible to seek enlightenment on this matter from England , as the origin of trusts in Scotland is very different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	295	He said that it is possible to accept the position that a person can make himself a trustee of his own property provided he does something equivalent to delivery or transfer of the trust fund . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	296	But for the reasons that I have already given there is an unbroken tract of authority to the effect that the mere act of delivering the disposition , which is a personal deed , does not affect the title to the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	297	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	298	Had it not been for the views which my noble and learned friend Lord Hobhouse has expressed on this point I would not have wished to say anything more about it , as no arguments were addressed to this matter on either side . 	lord hope	lord hobhouse	partagr	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	299	But I do need to say something in reply to the concern which he has , quite understandably , expressed that there was here a fully arguable route to a solution in the appellants ' favour which was not and should have been taken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	300	46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	301	The first and most important point that has to be made is that according to the law of Scotland a trust , in the present context , has to be created expressly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	302	Scots law does not accept that a constructive or remedial trust can arise from a contract of sale , nor does it recognise the concept of equitable ownership : see the discussion in Sharp v Thomson , 1995 SC 455 , 479-481 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	303	So a person has to do two things if he wishes to establish a trust of his own property in favour of a third party , such as a purchaser . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	304	He must first make a declaration that the property is to be held in trust for the third party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	305	He must then effect delivery of the trust property to a trustee or , if he himself is to be the sole trustee , he must do something which is the equivalent of delivery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	306	As Lord Cameron pointed out in Gibson v Hunter Home Designs Limited , 1976 SC 23 , 31 , it is no longer open to doubt since Allan 's Trustees v Lord Advocate , 1971 SC -LRB- HL -RRB- 45 , that a truster can put his own funds into a trust of which he may himself be the sole trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	307	But there must , as he went on to say , be some identifiable declaration of trust and there must then be intimation of the fact of the trust and its tenor or delivery of the trust deed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	308	A mere declaration of intent is not sufficient , as there must be a clear and identifiable declaration of trust - an express declaration , as Lord Kinnear said in Bank of Scotland v Hutchison Main -LRB- in liquidation -RRB- 1914 SC -LRB- HL -RRB- 1 , 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	309	47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	310	The key to a proper understanding of the decision on this point in Gibson lies in the fact that there was no language in either the missives or the disposition which could be construed as having this effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	311	In Allan 's Trustees , on the other hand , it was clear that the words which Miss Allan used in her letter to the insurance company were sufficient to create a trust . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	312	They contained an express declaration that the policy was from the moment of its commencement to be held in trust for named beneficiaries . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	313	The problem which Lord Reid was considering in that case was the problem of delivery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	314	48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	315	In the present case there is no problem of delivery , as the disposition was delivered to the purchasers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	316	The problem is that the disposition lacked any words which could be said to amount to an express declaration that until it was recorded the property was being held in trust for the purchasers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	317	This problem could have been cured by inserting words into the disposition which had this effect , as my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann is right to point out . 	lord hope	lord hoffmann	partagr	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	318	An express declaration of trust in a separate deed would have been just as good , provided it was sufficiently clear to enable the trust property , the beneficiaries and the purpose of the trust to be identified and provided too that deed was delivered or at least intimated to the purchasers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	319	There was , to adopt Lord Hobhouse 's words , a communicated intimation . 	lord hope	lord hobhouse	partagr	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	320	But the document which was intimated - the disposition - did not contain any provision which could be construed as setting up a trust . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	321	In the absence of any such provision there could be no trust , however strong the evidence was about delivery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	322	49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	323	The second point that needs to be made is simply by way of clarification , lest there be any doubt as to the position which I was adopting on this matter in the Inner House in Sharp v Thomson , 1995 SC 455 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	324	It should be understood that the argument that was presented that a trust had been created in Gibson v Hunter Home Designs Limited , 1976 SC 23 was , as Lord President Emslie noted at p 27 , an alternative argument to the first argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	325	The first argument was that the property in the subjects had passed by virtue of the missives , payment of the price and actual entry to the subjects by the purchaser . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	326	This had nothing to do with the argument about the creation of a trust . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	327	The reservations which I expressed in Sharp at p 469 about the Lord President 's analysis of the three stages of the transfer of land to the purchaser were confined to that part of his opinion only . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	328	Nothing I said in Sharp was intended to cast any doubt on the soundness of his opinion on the trust argument , with which Lord Cameron too was in full agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	329	As I said in Sharp at p 479 , no one in that case suggested that the decision that no trust was created in Gibson was unsound in any respect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	330	It was in this context that Lord President Emslie referred to Lord Herschell 's speech in Heritable Reversionary Co Ltd v Millar -LRB- 1892 -RRB- 19 R -LRB- HL -RRB- 43 , 44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	331	There is nothing in that passage , or in the Lord President 's treatment of it , with which I disagree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	332	Conclusion 50 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	333	Mr Gale did not seek to argue that some kind of intermediate right of property in the subjects , the effect of which was to diminish the extent of Mrs Burnett 's real right in them , was transferred to the appellants when the disposition was delivered to them in settlement of the transaction which they had entered into . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	334	His case was that the subjects nevertheless did not form part of her `` whole estate '' as at the date of her sequestration within the meaning of section 31 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1985 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	335	51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	336	In my opinion the context in which the words `` the whole estate of the debtor '' appear in the statute shows that they must be given a meaning which gives effect to the rights which creditors are able to exercise against the debtor 's property to secure payment of their debts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	337	The permanent trustee in his turn is obliged by the statute to exercise on behalf of the general body of creditors all the rights which the creditors would each have been able to exercise against the bankrupt 's estate had they been acting as individuals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	338	The real right in the property of which Mrs Burnett was the beneficial owner remained vested in her at the date when the permanent trustee 's notice of title was recorded in the Sasine Register . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	339	The only qualifications on that right were of a personal character . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	340	They bound Mrs Burnett . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	341	But they were of no effect in a question with her creditors or with the permanent trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger

104	346	I agree that this appeal should be dismissed . 	lord hobhouse	self	outcome	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	347	I also agree that this should be for substantially the reasons given by my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead , both in this House and in his earlier judgments delivered in the Court of Session -LRB- eg , the first part of his judgment delivered in the First Division in Sharp v Thomson 1995 SC 455 -RRB- , and by my noble and learned friend Lord Rodger of Earlsferry . 	lord hobhouse	lord hope	fullagr	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	347	I also agree that this should be for substantially the reasons given by my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead , both in this House and in his earlier judgments delivered in the Court of Session -LRB- eg , the first part of his judgment delivered in the First Division in Sharp v Thomson 1995 SC 455 -RRB- , and by my noble and learned friend Lord Rodger of Earlsferry . 	lord hobhouse	lord rodger	fullagr	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	348	I pay tribute to the depth and intimacy of their knowledge of the Scots system of conveyancing , its history , law and practice , and its application in relation to the Scots insolvency statutes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	349	53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	350	I have however , like my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann , certain reservations which I will explain . 	lord hobhouse	lord hoffmann	partagr	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	351	But I should say at once that I am not shocked as a commercial lawyer by the scheme and consequences of a sequestration under s. 31 of the Bankruptcy -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1985 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	352	The law of England has very similar consequences which from time to time give rise to complaints by merchants that they have been harshly treated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	353	But the English law is and has been for several centuries that merchants must always be on guard against dealing with persons whose solvency is not assured and structure their transactions accordingly , particularly in international trade . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	354	The trustee in bankruptcy has powers beyond those possessed by the bankrupt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	355	There is a fundamental distinction between property rights or secured rights , on the one hand , which must be respected by the trustee and , on the other , contractual rights which can only give rise to a claim provable in the liquidation and the payment of a pro rata dividend -LRB- if any -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	356	But what does surprise me is that Scotland , now a highly developed economy , should have a land law which is still based on the judicial development , albeit sophisticated , of the laws of Rome and the mediaeval Feudal system . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	357	I recognise that by the Infeftment Act 1845 -LRB- and following statutes -RRB- the formalities involved in acquiring the legal and feudal title have been replaced by a requirement for the registration of the new transaction in the General Register of Sasines -LRB- seisin -RRB- , a deeds register , or in the Land Register , a titles register , and that following Scottish Law Commission Reports , Nos. 68 , 183 and 114 , and some academic criticism , more radical reforms sweeping away the feudal system are now being introduced under the Abolition of Feudal Tenure -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 2000 : see paragraphs 13 and 14 of Lord Hope 's Opinion . 	lord hobhouse	lord hope	partagr	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	358	54 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	359	My reservations have the following structure : -LRB- a -RRB- The 1985 Act expressly provides in s. 31 -LRB- 1 -RRB- it is subject to s. 33 and s. 33 -LRB- 1 -RRB- expressly provides that : `` The following property of the debtor shall not vest in the permanent trustee - ... -LRB- b -RRB- property held on trust by the debtor for any other person . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	360	This provision was new and was included in the 1985 Act on the express recommendation of the Law Commission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	361	-LRB- b -RRB- It is at least arguable that in the present case the debtor -LRB- vendor -RRB- , at the date of the sequestration , held the part of her heritable estate now in dispute on trust for another person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	362	-LRB- c -RRB- It follows that , by reason of this express statutory provision , the permanent trustee was not empowered to sequestrate it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	363	55 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	364	It was a feature of the present case that leading counsel for the appellants , although he was relying upon such cases as Heritable Reversionary Co Ltd v Millar -LRB- 1892 -RRB- 19 R -LRB- HL -RRB- 43 , expressly declined to rely in any way upon s. 33 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and did not argue the point ; consequently leading counsel was able to say that the point was not relied upon against him and therefore he would not address any argument about it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	365	The appeal proceeded solely upon the basis of the appellants ' argument that , as a matter of the true construction of s. 31 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , the words `` the whole estate of the of the debtor '' did not cover the property in dispute , an argument which was , in my opinion , bound to fail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	366	I find this all the more surprising since s. 33 -LRB- 1 -RRB- was the subject of submissions both before Sheriff Principal D J Risk QC and before the Extra Division . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	367	But it is clear that your Lordships ' House can not go behind the express concessions of the appellants ' counsel and that what I am about to say will be obiter and without the benefit of having heard argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	368	Section 33 -LRB- 1 -RRB- : 56 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	369	There is no dispute that s. 33 -LRB- 1 -RRB- was a deliberate statutory addition to the statutory scheme . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	370	There is also no dispute that the relevant time to test the question ` does the debtor hold the property on trust ? ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	371	is at the time of the making of the sequestration order under s. 6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	372	It makes no difference whether the trust did or did not predate the transaction between the vendor and the purchaser , provided that it existed by the time of the sequestration order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	373	It is also clear that the trust has to be what in England would be called an ` express ' trust . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	374	Scots law does not recognise constructive or remedial trusts or equities such as the equitable ownership arising from a contract enforceable by an order of specific performance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	375	It is also now clear that the `` tantum et tale '' argument is discredited but it is not the same as , or provide the answer to , the question requiring to be answered in the present case : did the debtor , at the material time , hold the property on trust ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	376	The submissions made in the courts below however did include whether a restricted interpretation should be given to the words `` held on trust '' so as to deprive the introduction of s. 33 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of any effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	377	This surprising submission apparently met with a mixed response in the courts below ; it does not seem to have carried any weight in this House with Lord Hope and Lord Rodger . 	lord hobhouse	lord hope	partagr	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	377	This surprising submission apparently met with a mixed response in the courts below ; it does not seem to have carried any weight in this House with Lord Hope and Lord Rodger . 	lord hobhouse	lord rodger	partagr	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	378	Was there here a trust ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	379	57 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	380	This is the nub of the point and requires to be developed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	381	But first I should refer to paragraphs 44 and 51 of the Opinion of Lord Hope that `` there is an unbroken tract of authority to the effect that the mere act of delivering the disposition , which is a personal deed , does not affect the title to the property '' . 	lord hobhouse	lord hope	partagr	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	382	To similar effect is what he said in Sharp v Thomson 1995 SC 455 , 468H : `` But there is no such thing as a real right which is imperfect or incomplete . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	383	Until the real right is transferred , the matter rests entirely upon personal obligation . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	384	With great respect this misses the present point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	385	The present point arises upon the basis that the purchaser never acquired the legal -LRB- or feudal -RRB- title : see Lord Hamilton at 2002 SLT 699 , 709I . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	386	He never acquired the `` real right '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	387	If he had , the present point would not have arisen . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	388	S. 33 -LRB- 1 -RRB- proceeds on the basis that the vendor has the legal title and the real right but nevertheless holds it -LRB- them -RRB- on trust for another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	389	The relevant question is not , as in previous cases , `` what if anything has the purchaser acquired ? '' but `` what is the status of the vendor at the material time ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	390	The unbroken tract of authority focuses upon and answers the first question : no one disputes that . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	391	But what now needs to be focussed on and answered is the second question which concerns the vendor not the purchaser . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	392	The former mind-set must be put to one side . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	393	-LRB- I will refer later to what was said by Lord President Emslie in Gibson v Hunter Home Designs 1976 SC 23 and by Lord Clyde in Sharp v Thomson 1997 SC -LRB- HL -RRB- 66 at pp.70-1 . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	394	58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	395	Turning now to the facts of this case , the transaction started with the usual missives which included the clause that the contract would cease to be enforceable in so far as fully implemented by -LSB- the delivery of the disposition -RSB- '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	396	The disposition signed by the vendor , dated and delivered 8th November 1990 did fully implement the missives . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	397	It acknowledged the payment of the full purchase price . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	398	It disponed `` heritably and irredeemably '' to the purchasers `` all and whole '' the property sold `` with entry and vacant possession as at 9th November 1990 '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	399	The purchasers did enter into the vacant possession of the property the following day as stated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	400	The earlier contract was therefore fully performed and ceased to have any further force or effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	401	The warrandice -LRB- that is to say the warranty of title -RRB- was expressly -LRB- re - -RRB- granted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	402	This last is , of course , solely a contractual warranty , liable if broken -LRB- which there is no suggestion it has ever been -RRB- to give rise to a contractual -LRB- ie personal -RRB- liability of the vendor in the future ; it in no way qualifies the completeness of the performance by the vendor of his obligations , indeed its -LRB- re - -RRB- grant in the disposition confirms that completeness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	403	The vendor had done everything required of her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	404	The only thing left to be done was a unilateral act to be done by the purchaser alone - registering the disposition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	405	59 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	406	Do these facts have any capacity to give rise to a trust ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	407	So far as formalities are concerned , Scots law does not require any formality or documentary evidence of the making of a trust save in one situation where the trustee unilaterally declares that he holds the property on trust where some document signed by the trustee is required as evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	408	The signed disposition delivered in the present case is capable of providing such written evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	409	It is only consistent with the debtor holding the property as a bare trustee and so declaring . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	410	60 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope, lord rodger
104	411	But Lord Hope -LRB- paragraph 44 -RRB- would still say that there is no capacity , citing Lord Reid 's speech in Allan 's Trustees v Lord Advocate 1971 SC -LRB- HL -RRB- 45 at pp 53-54 . 	lord hobhouse	lord hope	partagr	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	412	Lord Reid warned that the Scots law of trusts was not of the same origin as in the law of England . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	413	He emphasised that `` some sort of delivery '' was required to complete the trust . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	414	He obviously was using these looser words to distinguish what was required from the acts of ` delivery ' required to complete a transfer of the legal or feudal title ; he was postulating that the legal title remained with the trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	415	He said that something `` equivalent to delivery '' of the property - `` equivalent to delivery ... of the trust fund '' - was required to bring the trust into operation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	416	Contractual words alone are not enough though a communicated `` intimation '' to the beneficiary might be equivalent to delivery of the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	417	In the present case there was both a communicated intimation and a delivery of the property to the purchaser . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	418	In the present case the purchaser as previously demonstrated does not have to invoke any words of contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	419	So the language of Lord Reid does not provide the permanent trustee with an answer to the relevant question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	420	61 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	421	The key inquiry is : what does the evidence support as amounting to a trust ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	422	What status of the vendor does it show existed at the material time ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	423	The authorities provide the answer : it was the status of a bare trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	424	The seminal authority is the dicta in the Heritable Reversionary case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	425	The modern authority is the speeches of Lord Keith , Lord Jauncey and Lord Clyde in Sharp . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	426	There is also a useful discussion by Lord President Emslie in Gibson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	427	I accept that both Heritable Reversionary and Sharp are distinguishable and were decided on the construction of the particular security documents -LRB- and applicable statutes -RRB- in those cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	428	Lord Hope and Lord Rodger would follow neither . 	lord hobhouse	lord hope	partagr	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	428	Lord Hope and Lord Rodger would follow neither . 	lord hobhouse	lord rodger	partagr	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger

104	430	62 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	431	In Heritable Reversionary , Lord Herschell said that confusion must be avoided between the position where `` the owner appearing on the register is a bare trustee '' and that where the owner has simply `` come under some contractual obligation '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	432	-LRB- p. 44 -RRB- Lord Watson said at p. 46 : `` As between -LSB- the debtor and the other person -RSB- there can , in my opinion , be no doubt that according to the law of Scotland the one , though possessed of the legal title , and being the apparent owner , is in reality a bare trustee '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	433	Per Lord Field at p. 54 : `` if the two interests , the legal on the one hand , and the whole beneficial interest on the other , are vested in different persons , the apparent owner who has the legal title is , as between him and the beneficial owner , the bare trustee '' : see also at p. 55 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	434	This House upheld the dissenting judgment of Lord M'Laren in the First Division . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	435	63 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	436	In Gibson , Lord Emslie rejected the argument that the missives were capable of giving a proprietary right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	437	He affirmed that a contract gives no more than a jus crediti . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	438	`` Putting the matter in another way the seller of subjects under missives is not , in a question with the purchaser , divested of any part of his right of property in the subjects of sale until , in implement of his contractual obligation to do so , he delivers to the purchaser the appropriate disposition . '' -LRB- p. 27 -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	439	He referred to Heritable Reversionary citing Lord Herschell at p. 44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	440	He expressly pointed out that an undelivered disposition , the payment of the price or mere entry on the subjects -LRB- referable to the terms of the missives -RRB- provide `` no evidence whatsoever of the constitution of a trust '' `` pending delivery of the disposition '' . -LRB- p. 28 -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	441	Lord Emslie 's dicta were followed and applied in later cases , but not by Lord Hope who expressly disapproved them . 	lord hobhouse	lord hope	partagr	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	442	-LRB- For those interested , English law applies similar criteria , distinguishing between contracts not yet fully performed and those which have been fully performed : see Jenkins J in Re Rose -LSB- 1949 -RSB- Ch 78 , 89 and Snell 's Equity : Chapter 7.6 . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger

104	444	Sharp concerned a floating charge over the property of a company which had developed flats on a plot of ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	445	The company sold one of the flats to the Thomsons and delivered the disposition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	446	Receivers were then appointed and the floating charge crystallised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	447	The Thomsons then recorded the disposition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	448	Lord Keith -LRB- as did Lords Browne-Wilkinson and Steyn -RRB- expressly agreed with the speeches of Lord Jauncey and Lord Clyde . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	449	Lord Jauncey held that after delivery of the disposition the vendor was a bare trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	450	-LRB- pp. 71 and 72 -RRB- ; `` as between disponer and disponee the transfer of all the former 's interest is at once complete upon the delivery of the disposition '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	451	-LRB- p. 73 -RRB- Lord Clyde affirmed the distinction between a jus in re , a jus ad rem and a jus crediti . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	452	-LRB- p. 84 and p. 80 -RRB- Turning to the case before him , he analysed the position of the debtor company and , treating it for this purpose as if it was a disponer , said that , where a disposition had been delivered , the disponer `` had a bare title to the flat , a real right , but a right which was open to defeat as soon as the disponees recorded their disposition '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	453	-LRB- p. 84 -RRB- Thus , the legal and feudal title remained with the disponer as a bare title but nothing more . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	454	He approved Heritable Reversionary on the basis that the bankrupt was a `` bare trustee '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	455	-LRB- p. 80 -RRB- 65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	456	I consider that applying s33 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and the existing judicial authorities , the facts of this case do make out a fully arguable prima facie case that the debtor did at the material time hold the subjects on trust for the disponee as a bare trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	457	For those who wish to see a more just result in disposition cases , I suggest that s. 33 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and the existing authorities provide a fully arguable route to obtaining that goal should the situation arise again -LRB- which it possibly never will -RRB- and it is unfortunate that it was lost sight of in the present case .

104	459	LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	460	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	461	66 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	462	A , the owner , sells her flat to B and C. B and C pay the price to A and , in return , she delivers the relevant disposition to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	463	B and C take possession of the flat , but do not record the disposition in the Register of Sasines -LRB- `` the register '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	464	A is sequestrated and , on the basis that the flat remains part of her estate at the date of sequestration , the trustee in sequestration , who knows of the disposition to B and C , records a notice of title to the flat in the register . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	465	B and C then record their disposition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	466	An Extra Division of the Court of Session hold that the trustee 's title is to be preferred and that he can evict B and C from the flat without repaying the price . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	467	Reduced to algebraic terms , that is the issue that confronts the House in this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	468	67 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	469	The decision of the Extra Division is correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	470	But it shocks . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	471	It is important not to play down that sense of shock since admitting that the decision shocks , and identifying why , are the keys to explaining why it is also correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	472	It shocks because it seems inequitable when judged by the criteria applied in other cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	473	Suppose that D , a purchaser from A , who was aware that she had previously sold and disponed the flat to B and C , deliberately tried to cut them out by recording his disposition before them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	474	He would be regarded as not being in good faith and would therefore not obtain a valid title . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	475	In the case of a purchaser like D , as Lord Justice Clerk Thomson famously remarked in Rodger -LRB- Builders -RRB- Ltd v Fawdry 1950 SC 483 , 501 , `` offside goals are disallowed '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	476	They are disallowed because they are judged to be unfair . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	477	By contrast , the trustee in A 's sequestration who proceeds to record a notice of title ahead of B and C , despite being well aware of A 's previous sale and disposition to B and C and with the intention of cutting them out , is not regarded as being in bad faith and obtains a valid title . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	478	The offside rule does not apply and the trustee 's goal is allowed - even though , by the standards that apply to a purchaser , it would be judged to be unfair and would not be allowed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	479	In order to maximise the assets available to the creditors , the trustee can deliberately set out to destroy B and C 's right to complete their title . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	480	The difference in this respect between a purchaser and a trustee in sequestration lies at the heart of this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	481	The Facts 68 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	482	The actual circumstances can be summarised quite shortly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	483	In October 1990 the appellants , Mr and Mrs Grainger , entered into a contract with Mrs Carlene Burnett to buy her flat at 94 Malcolm Road , Peterculter , Aberdeen for # 45,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	484	On 8 November 1990 Mrs Burnett executed a disposition of the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	485	On the same day her agents delivered the disposition to the Graingers ' agents in exchange for the price . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	486	The following day the Graingers took possession of the flat . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	487	At that stage their agents did not follow the usual course of recording the disposition in the register - apparently because of a possible exchange of garden ground that was in contemplation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	488	At some point Mrs Burnett executed a trust deed in favour of her creditors , the trustee being an accountant , Mr Michael Reid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	489	On 29 May 1991 , on a petition at his instance , Mrs Burnett 's estate was sequestrated and Mr Reid was appointed interim trustee in the sequestration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	490	On 23 July 1991 the sheriff declared Mr Reid to be the permanent trustee -LRB- `` the respondent '' -RRB- and , by virtue of the act and warrant of that date , the whole of Mrs Burnett 's estate as at 29 May 1991 vested in the respondent as trustee for the benefit of her creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	491	Although no proof has been held , it is clear from the respondent 's pleadings that , by 25 November 1991 at the latest , he was aware that the appellants still intended to record their title to the flat . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	492	On 10 December 1991 the respondent recorded a notice of title in the register giving notice that , as trustee , he had right to the flat . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	493	On 27 January 1992 the Graingers ' agents recorded the disposition from Mrs Burnett . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	494	69 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	495	In these proceedings the respondent craves a declarator that the appellants are not entitled to occupy the flat and a further declarator that the property in the flat is meantime , and has been since the date of sequestration , vested in him as the permanent trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	496	In addition he craves warrant for the summary ejection of the appellants , their dependants and tenants from the flat . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	497	The sheriff granted decree in terms of these three craves . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	498	On appeal the sheriff principal allowed the appeal and dismissed the action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	499	An Extra Division -LRB- Lord Coulsfield , Lord Maclean and Lord Hamilton -RRB- allowed the respondent 's appeal and restored the sheriff 's order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	500	In this appeal your Lordships are asked to restore the decree of the sheriff principal and to dismiss the action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	501	Counsel informed the House that since the Court of Session hearing the appellants had moved out of the flat and that , by agreement between the parties , steps were being taken to sell it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger

104	504	Ultimately , the decision in the case turns on the interpretation and effect of section 31 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Bankruptcy -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1985 -LRB- `` the 1985 Act '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger

104	507	A petition is presented to the court and , in a case like the present , the court grants warrant to cite the debtor to appear before it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	508	The date of the grant of the warrant becomes the date of sequestration : section 12 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , -LRB- 2 -RRB- and -LRB- 4 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	509	Under section 13 -LRB- 1 -RRB- the court appoints an interim trustee and the clerk of court must forthwith send a certified copy of the relevant court order to the keeper of the register of inhibitions and adjudications for recording in that register : section 14 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	510	72 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	511	Recording the certificate has the effect , as from the date of sequestration , of an inhibition and of a citation in an adjudication of the debtor 's heritable estate at the instance of the creditors who subsequently have claims accepted in the sequestration : section 14 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	512	By virtue of the inhibition the debtor is prevented from disposing voluntarily of any heritable property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	513	Moreover , under section 37 -LRB- 1 -RRB- the court order has certain effects in relation to other diligences : `` The order of the court awarding sequestration shall as from the date of sequestration have the effect , in relation to diligence done -LRB- whether before or after the date of sequestration -RRB- in respect of any part of the debtor 's estate , of - -LRB- a -RRB- a decree of adjudication of the heritable estate of the debtor for payment of his debts which has been duly recorded in the register of inhibitions and adjudications on that date ; and -LRB- b -RRB- an arrestment in execution and decree of forthcoming , an arrestment in execution and warrant of sale , and a completed poinding , in favour of the creditors according to their respective entitlements . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	514	In the present case it is the effects on heritable property that are of more significance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	515	Under the Diligence Act 1661 and the Adjudication Act 1672 all adjudications for personal debts before , or within a year and a day after , the first effectual adjudication , come in together , as if one adjudication had been obtained for all the sums in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	516	Since the court order has the effect of a decree of adjudication for payment , the result is that , where the sequestration begins within a year and a day of the first effectual adjudication , the general body of creditors immediately rank pari passu on the proceeds of that first effectual adjudication . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	517	In other words any security which the first creditor obtained by adjudging the debtor 's heritable property becomes , in effect , a security in favour of the general body of creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	518	In addition section 31 -LRB- 8 -RRB- makes it incompetent on or after the date of sequestration for any creditor to raise or insist in an adjudication against the estate of the debtor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	519	73 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	520	In terms of section 21 -LRB- 1 -RRB- the interim trustee must call a meeting of creditors to be held within 28 days of the date of sequestration , or such longer period as the sheriff may allow on cause shown . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	521	At that meeting , if possible , the creditors proceed to elect a permanent trustee : section 24 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	522	The interim trustee reports this election to the sheriff who , failing any timeous objection , declares the elected person to be the permanent trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	523	The sheriff confirms his election and the sheriff clerk issues to him an act and warrant : section 25 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	524	This procedure was followed in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	525	74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	526	When the permanent trustee is appointed , the estate of the bankrupt vests in him for the benefit of the creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	527	This happens by virtue of section 31 which provides inter alia : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- Subject to section 33 of this Act and section 91 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Pensions Act 1995 , the whole estate of the debtor shall vest as at the date of sequestration in the permanent trustee for the benefit of the creditors ; and - -LRB- a -RRB- the estate shall so vest by virtue of the act and warrant issued on confirmation of the permanent trustee 's appointment ; and -LRB- b -RRB- the act and warrant shall , in respect of the heritable estate in Scotland of the debtor , have the same effect as if a decree of adjudication in implement of sale , as well as a decree of adjudication for payment and in security of debt , subject to no legal reversion had been pronounced in favour of the permanent trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	528	-LRB- 2 -RRB- The exercise by the permanent trustee of any power conferred on him by this Act in respect of any heritable estate vested in him by virtue of the act and warrant shall not be challengeable on the ground of any prior inhibition -LRB- reserving any effect of such inhibition on ranking -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope, lord rodger
104	529	-LRB- 3 -RRB- Where the debtor has an uncompleted title to any heritable estate in Scotland , the permanent trustee may complete title thereto either in his own name or in the name of the debtor , but completion of title in the name of the debtor shall not validate by accretion any unperfected right in favour of any person other than the permanent trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	530	-LRB- 4 -RRB- Any moveable property , in respect of which but for this subsection - -LRB- a -RRB- delivery or possession ; or -LRB- b -RRB- intimation of its assignation , would be required in order to complete title to it , shall vest in the permanent trustee by virtue of the act and warrant as if at that date of sequestration the permanent trustee had taken delivery or possession of the property or had made intimation of its assignation to him as the case may be . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	531	I shall have to examine subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- in more detail later . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	532	At present it should be noted that the `` whole estate of the debtor '' which vests in the trustee under subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- is `` his whole estate at the date of sequestration , wherever situated '' : section 31 -LRB- 8 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	533	It does not , however , include property that the bankrupt held on trust for anyone else : section 33 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	534	Similarly , when the estate vests in the permanent trustee , this is without prejudice to the right of any secured creditor that is preferable to the trustee 's rights : section 33 -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	535	On the other hand , subject to certain exceptions which are not relevant for present purposes , any dealing of , or with , the debtor relating to the estate vested in the permanent trustee is of no effect in a question with the trustee : section 32 -LRB- 8 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	536	75 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	537	The permanent trustee must recover , manage and realise the debtor 's estate and distribute it among the debtor 's creditors , according to their respective entitlements : section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	538	Under section 39 he is given extensive powers for achieving this and , under section 64 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , the debtor must take any practicable step , including executing any document , which may be necessary to enable the permanent trustee to perform this function . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	539	The provisions for calculating the creditors ' entitlement are somewhat complex , but the basic rule is that a creditor is entitled to claim the accumulated sum of principal and interest which is due on the debt as at the date of sequestration : sections 22 -LRB- 9 -RRB- and 48 -LRB- 7 -RRB- and paragraph 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of schedule 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	540	The parties ' submissions 76 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	541	The rival submissions for the parties were , basically , simple and related to the interpretation of the phrase `` the whole estate of the debtor '' in section 31 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1985 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	542	77 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	543	For the appellants Mr Gale QC submitted that these words were not apt to include Mrs Burnett 's title to the flat which , before her sequestration , she had sold to the appellants and in respect of which she had granted them a disposition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	544	Having taken these steps , Mrs Burnett could not have sold the flat to anyone else without committing a criminal offence - fraud of some kind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	545	She therefore had no substantial interest in the flat and merely held a bare title to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	546	Following the general approach adopted by this House in Heritable Reversionary Company Ltd v Millar -LRB- 1892 -RRB- 19 R -LRB- HL -RRB- 43 and Sharp v Thomson 1997 SC -LRB- HL -RRB- 66 , your Lordships should hold that Parliament did not intend that property held by the debtor under this bare title should form part of her `` estate '' which vested in the respondent as permanent trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	547	Rather , on her sequestration the bare title to the flat had remained in Mrs Burnett : the respondent had therefore had no power to deal with it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	548	His purported registration of the notice of title to the flat in the register was void . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	549	By registering the disposition in their favour the appellants had accordingly divested Mrs Burnett of the real right to the flat and had vested it in themselves . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	550	The appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	551	78 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	552	For the respondent Mr Hodge QC submitted that the words `` the whole estate of the debtor '' meant what they said . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	553	By his act and warrant the entire estate of the debtor vested in the permanent trustee , except in so far as the 1985 Act provided otherwise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	554	While property held on trust for any other person was excluded by section 33 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , there was no similar exclusion of property in respect of which the debtor had granted a disposition but to which the disponee had not completed title . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	555	It followed that the debtor 's right in the flat had vested in the permanent trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	556	Although Mrs Burnett could not have sold the flat to anyone else without committing a crime , this was due to her obligations to the appellants under the disposition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	557	The real right remained vested in her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	558	If she had in fact -LRB- wrongfully -RRB- sold and conveyed the flat to a second purchaser , he would have been entitled to rely on the entry in the register showing her as the owner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	559	He would not have been affected by any dealings between Mrs Burnett and the appellants unless he knew of them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	560	On registering his disposition and becoming infeft before the appellants recorded their disposition , the second purchaser would accordingly have obtained a valid title to the flat from Mrs Burnett and could have ejected the appellants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	561	This showed that the obligations under the disposition which affected Mrs Burnett were purely personal and did not qualify her right of property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	562	It was her right of property that had vested in the respondent and he was not affected by any of her personal obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	563	He could therefore record a title to the flat and sell it , so that the proceeds would be available for distribution to Mrs Burnett 's creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	564	This approach to the interpretation of the 1985 Act was consistent with the way that the equivalent provisions in earlier bankruptcy statutes had been applied as part of the scheme of creditors ' remedies in Scots law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	565	The decisions in Heritable Reversionary Company Ltd v Millar and Sharp v Thomson were distinguishable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	566	If the latter were not distinguishable , the House should not follow it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	567	The present case was exceptional because of the extreme delay in recording the disposition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	568	In practice no problem would arise provided that dispositions were registered promptly , in accordance with good conveyancing practice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	569	A client who suffered prejudice as a result of the solicitor taking too long to register could recover appropriate damages for professional negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	570	If , contrary to counsel 's submission , the present case were thought to highlight a genuine weakness in the Scots law of bankruptcy , the legislature was the appropriate body to deal with it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	571	The significance of the register in this case 79 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	572	In the course of his submissions Mr Hodge repeatedly emphasised the central rôle of the register and the consequent need to maintain the rule that a prospective purchaser or heritable creditor is entitled to rely on the title as revealed in the deeds on the register . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	573	Hence he is not to be affected by personal rights that are not recorded there . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	574	As my noble and learned friend , Lord Hoffmann , observed during the hearing , however , it was not always clear exactly how these somewhat general submissions applied to the circumstances of this case . 	lord rodger	lord hoffmann	partagr	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	575	80 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	576	There is nothing in the pleadings to suggest that Mrs Burnett 's personal creditors ever had regard to her title to the flat when initially deciding to contract with her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	577	Of course , at the time of Mrs Burnett 's sequestration the register would have shown her as being infeft as owner of the flat but would not have revealed that she had sold it to the Graingers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	578	But , when he recorded the notice of title , the respondent was not relying on the register for his information : from other sources he already knew that she had sold the flat and delivered the disposition to the Graingers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	579	In this respect his situation was by no means unique : from time to time purchasers will be aware of such a previous transaction and disposition by the seller . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	580	If so , they are not entitled to ignore that information on the ground that the disposition is not recorded in the register . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	581	If , knowing of the previous transaction and disposition , they record their disposition , they are not in good faith and will not obtain a valid title - the offside goals rule applies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	582	Here , by contrast , the respondent says that , being aware of the Graingers ' rights under their disposition , he could legitimately ignore them and obtain the real right to the flat as an asset for Mrs Burnett 's creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	583	81 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	584	It follows that , in a case like the present , the fact that the disposition is not recorded in the register had no bearing on the creditors ' initial decision to contract with Mrs Burnett . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	585	Nor did it mislead the trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	586	For him the critical question is simply whether , by granting the disposition , Mrs Burnett has prevented him from ultimately acquiring the real right to the flat . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	587	For , if granting the disposition were to have that effect , then any notice of title recorded by the trustee would mislead purchasers from the trustee into believing that they could acquire a valid title from him when in fact they could not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	588	The reliability of the register would thus be compromised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	589	It was , partly at least , in order to preserve the integrity of the register from that kind of threat that , in the great case of Bell v Gartshore -LRB- 1737 -RRB- M 2848 ; 2 Ross 's LC 410 , the Court of Session adopted the principle that unrecorded personal deeds , such as a disposition , could not affect feudal rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	590	In two further important cases , Douglas v Adjudging Creditors of Kelhead -LRB- 1765 -RRB- 3 Ross 's LC 169 ; sub nom Douglas v Stewarts M 15616 and Mitchells v Ferguson -LRB- 1781 -RRB- M 10296 ; Hailes 879 ; 3 Ross 's LC 120 the court went on to hold that this principle applied even in cases , like the present , where the creditors had not relied on the register when contracting with the debtor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	591	I examine these cases in detail below . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	592	Though important , the principle is not , of course , sacrosanct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	593	Deriving , as it does from legislation rather than from the common law , it is subject to any qualifications in the relevant legislation , such as the provision on trusts in section 33 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1985 Act and the provisions on floating charges in the Companies Act 1985 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	594	Sharp v Thomson 82 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	595	The disputed interpretation of section 31 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1985 Act therefore brings up certain more fundamental issues of Scottish property and bankruptcy law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	596	Like his predecessor in Sharp v Thomson , however , counsel for the appellants was at pains to stress that he did not question these more basic aspects of the law : they stood inviolate , but were of no relevance if , on the proper interpretation of section 31 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , the flat was not part of Mrs Burnett 's estate and so did not vest in the respondent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	597	83 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	598	Sharp v Thomson concerned a floating charge which a company had granted over the whole of its property which might from time to time be `` comprised in our property and undertaking '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	599	The terms of the charge echoed the terms of section 462 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Companies Act 1985 which allows a company to create a charge `` over all or any part of the property ... which may from time to time be comprised in its property and undertaking . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	600	The company had sold a flat , which was part of its property , and had delivered the relevant disposition to the purchaser . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	601	Before the purchaser 's agents recorded the disposition , however , the floating charge crystallised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	602	The question was whether , at the time of crystallisation , the company 's rights to the flat still formed part of `` our property and undertaking '' in terms of the charge and , by implication , in terms of section 462 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	603	The Court of Session held that the rights were caught by the floating charge , but your Lordships ' House allowed the purchasers ' appeal on the basis that the term `` property '' in section 462 -LRB- 1 -RRB- was not being used in any technical sense and was not intended to include the company 's bare title to the flat which the purchasers could have defeated at any moment by recording their disposition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	604	Lord Jauncey and Lord Clyde gave the only two full speeches , with which the other members of the House agreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	605	It is possible to detect differences between the two speeches , as Lord Hamilton demonstrated in his careful analysis in this case in the court below : 2002 SLT 699 , 708K - 709E , para 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	606	As he also pointed out , however , at p 708J , for the House the essential question in Sharp v Thomson concerned the construction of the words `` property and undertaking '' in the instrument of charge and , by implication , in section 462 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	607	See , for instance , Lord Clyde 's identification of the issue , 1997 SC -LRB- HL -RRB- 66 , 79H , and his emphasis , at p 82A - D , on the need to construe the term `` property '' as part of the phrase `` property and undertaking '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	608	84 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	609	In these circumstances I respectfully agree with the Extra Division that Sharp v Thomson is distinguishable from the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	610	In itself that does not mean , of course , that the approach to interpretation which was identified in that case should not be applied here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	611	Admittedly , the two expressions in question are rather different : `` property and undertaking '' in Sharp , `` the whole estate '' in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	612	But , again , that difference would not of itself be enough to show that the approach adopted in Sharp should not be applied , with suitable modifications , in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	613	Indeed Lord Jauncey appears to have assumed that a permanent trustee in bankruptcy could not obtain a real right by recording a notice of title before the uninfeft proprietors recorded their disposition : 1997 SC -LRB- HL -RRB- 66 , 77F - G . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	614	The cases differ fundamentally , however , in another respect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	615	The words which the House had to interpret in Sharp were relatively new , having first entered Scots law in the Floating Charges and Receivers -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1961 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	616	Since there was little prior authority to indicate how they should be interpreted in the circumstances of that case , the House was relatively free to adopt its own interpretation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	617	Here , by contrast , the provision that the House has to interpret is only the latest embodiment of a measure with a history stretching back for 200 years or more . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	618	Moreover , the very wording of section 31 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , which speaks of adjudication in implement of sale and adjudication for payment and in security of debt , imports by reference a body of law regulating these matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	619	In this case it is therefore simply not possible to interpret and apply the relevant words without regard to a considerable body of authority which underlies and surrounds the bankruptcy legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	620	Mrs Burnett not a trustee for the appellants 85 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	621	As Lord Clyde noted in Sharp v Thomson 1997 SC -LRB- HL -RRB- 66 , 83E - F , the focus is not so much on the position of the purchasers as on the position of the debtor who has granted the disposition and , hence , of the permanent trustee in whom her estate has vested . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	622	It is worth emphasising , therefore , that Mr Gale did not submit that prior to her sequestration Mrs Burnett had held the title to the flat in trust for the appellants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	623	It respectfully appears to me , despite the observations of my noble and learned friend , Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough , that he was right to do so , for the reasons explained by my noble and learned friend , Lord Hope of Craighead . 	lord rodger	lord hobhouse	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	623	It respectfully appears to me , despite the observations of my noble and learned friend , Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough , that he was right to do so , for the reasons explained by my noble and learned friend , Lord Hope of Craighead . 	lord rodger	lord hope	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	624	Modern Scots law does indeed recognise that a person can make himself a trustee of his own property for trust purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	625	But , as Lord Reid held in Allan 's Trs v Lord Advocate 1971 SC -LRB- HL -RRB- 45 , 54 , the truster must have an intention to make himself trustee of his own property and must also do something equivalent to delivery or transfer of the trust fund . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	626	In the present case there is no declaration of trust or anything else to suggest that Mrs Burnett ever intended to make herself trustee of her property in the flat for the benefit of the appellants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	627	So no question of trust arises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	628	This case is accordingly distinguishable from Heritable Reversionary Company Ltd v Millar -LRB- 1892 -RRB- 19 R -LRB- HL -RRB- 43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	629	There the House held that , where the bankrupt had been the trustee of property , the bare legal title to that property did not form part of `` the whole property of the debtor '' and so did not vest in the permanent trustee in bankruptcy under section 102 of the Bankruptcy -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1856 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	630	Here , by contrast , the appellants ' case is not that Mrs Burnett was actually a trustee and had the bare title of a trustee but that , having delivered the disposition , she had only a bare title which no more formed part of her `` estate '' for the purposes of section 31 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1985 Act than the bankrupt trustee 's bare title in the Heritable Reversionary Company case formed part of his `` property '' for the purposes of section 102 of the 1856 Act .

104	631	86 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	632	The tenure of moveable property in Scotland is , and always has been , allodial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	633	Craig , Jus Feudale 1.9.25 , says that all moveables are allodial and we have full ownership in them and can use or abuse them as we wish : mobilia autem omnia allodialia sunt , in quibus dominium plenum habemus , ut iis uti , vel abuti , pro arbitrio nostro possimus . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	634	By contrast , with certain exceptions , the tenure of land in Scotland is feudal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	635	This remains the position until 28 November 2004 when the feudal system is due to be abolished by section 1 of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	636	While the rights of the feudal superior are still important in controlling certain uses that the vassal can make of his property , in other respects they have for the most part dwindled in significance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	637	Moreover , the radical reforms that were progressively introduced between 1845 and 1874 swept away most of the technicalities of feudal conveyancing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	638	To lawyers of today a discussion of those technicalities may seem even more sensational than a chapter on the fall of the rupee in a political economy textbook . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	639	Since , however , the law of bankruptcy in Scotland developed at a time when they still had to be observed , the underlying principles must be recovered by penetrating the technicalities that encrust them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	640	Real , personal and feudal rights 87 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	641	Drawing on Roman law , Scots law distinguishes between real rights , rights in rem , and personal rights , rights in personam . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	642	In Sharp v Thomson 1995 SC 455 , 461G - 475E Lord President Hope went into the Scottish authorities in detail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	643	Since his analysis has not been challenged , I can deal quite briefly with the point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	644	The distinction between the two kinds of rights has never been explained more clearly or concisely than in B Nicholas , An Introduction to Roman Law -LRB- 1962 -RRB- , p 100 : `` Any claim is either in rem or in personam , and there is an unbridgeable division between them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	645	An action in rem asserts a relationship between a person and a thing , an action in personam a relationship between persons ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope, lord rodger
104	646	The Romans think in terms of actions not of rights , but in substance one action asserts a right over a thing , the other a right against a person , and hence comes the modern dichotomy between rights in rem and rights in personam . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	647	Obviously there can not be a dispute between a person and a thing , and therefore even in an action in rem there must be a defendant , but he is there not because he is alleged to be under any duty to the plaintiff but because by some act he is denying the alleged right of the plaintiff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	648	In a rei vindicatio he is denying the plaintiff 's ownership by being in possession of the thing claimed . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	649	As is apparent from the summary of counsel 's submissions , this unbridgeable division between real and personal rights is central to the respondent 's case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	650	He claims that , since Mrs Burnett retained the real right of ownership in the flat , under section 31 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1985 Act her right was disponed to him as trustee , unqualified by any rights of the appellants against Mrs Burnett which were purely personal , existed solely between them and were of no concern to him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	651	By recording the notice of title , the respondent says , he acquired the real right of property in the flat that the appellants are denying - originally , by possessing the flat . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	652	He therefore asks the court to pronounce a declarator of that right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	653	88 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	654	The point is often made that in Scots law the real right of ownership in things is transferred by giving possession and not by mere agreement : traditionibus non nudis pactis rerum dominia transferuntur . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	655	While that rule does not apply to the economically most significant transactions in moveable property , sales under the Sale of Goods Act 1979 , it does apply to the passing of title in corporeal moveables in other circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	656	In the case of land , however , the position is more complicated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	657	If I grant you a disposition of a piece of land that I own , or you acquire the land under a court order having the effect of a disposition , and then you enter into possession , you do not acquire a real right of ownership in the land . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	658	This is because the feudal estate in the land is not transferred merely by giving you possession . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	659	The feudal estate is transferred only by the disponee becoming invested or infeft in it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	660	At common law this required the purchaser to be given sasine , viz feudal possession , in a special symbolic ceremony performed on the land on behalf either of the feudal superior or of the disponer - depending on whether the chosen method was resignation in favorem and regrant or base infeftment followed by a charter of confirmation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	661	Hence the brocard quoted by Stair , Institutions of the Law of Scotland 2.4.18 : nulla sasina , nulla terra , no sasine , no land . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	662	In the case of land the rule is : the real right of ownership in lands is transferred by the giving of sasine not by mere agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	663	That remains the theoretical position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	664	Nowadays it would , however , be more realistic to say that ownership in lands is transferred by recording the disposition , not by mere agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	665	Registration 89 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	666	Provided that there was a disposition of the lands from the true infeft proprietor and sasine was given and duly witnessed , at common law nothing more was required for the disponee to acquire a real right in the lands . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	667	This created opportunities for fraud since the owner might sell the lands and grant sasine to more than one person , there being no effective way for the victims to discover the existence of any other grant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	668	After a number of unsuccessful attempts , the Registration Act 1617 -LRB- `` the 1617 Act '' -RRB- laid the foundations of the system of registration of deeds which has existed ever since and which has proved largely effective in preventing such frauds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	669	It provided that all instruments of sasine should be registered within sixty days of their date , failing which , they should `` make no faith in judgment by way of action or exception in prejudice of a third party who hath acquired a perfect and lawful right to the said lands and heritages ; but prejudice always to them to use the said writs against the partie maker thereof , his heirs and successors . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	670	The effect of this Act and of the later Act 1696 c 18 was to make it compulsory for disponees to register the relevant instrument of sasine within 60 days . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	671	In other words , even though all the necessary elaborate requirements of the common law had been completed , the disponee would not be able to rely on his instrument of sasine against a third party `` who hath acquired a perfect and lawful right '' to the land unless he had registered the instrument of sasine . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	672	90 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	673	Once the requirement for registration had been introduced , various problems emerged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	674	One was how to determine the priority of infeftments on which sasines were taken and duly registered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	675	The Real Rights Act 1693 gave the answer : `` That All Infeftments whether of property or annual-rent or other Reall Rights whereupon Sasines for hereafter shall be taken shall in all Competitions be preferable and preferred according to the date and priority of the Registrations of the Sasines without respect of the distinction of Base and publick Infeftments or of being clad with possession or not clad with possession in all time coming . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	676	This statute remains in force today and is central to the case for the respondent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	677	He says that , by recording his notice of title in the register , he took sasine on his infeftment of the property in the flat and this infeftment is to be preferred to the infeftment of the appellants who did not record their disposition in the register until some weeks later . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	678	91 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	679	The obligation to record the instrument of sasine in the register within sixty days remained in force until section 3 of the Infeftment Act 1845 provided that the instrument could be competently recorded at any time during the lifetime of the party in whose favour it had been expede . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	680	One might have thought that , with the removal of the time-limit , the incentive to register the instrument of sasine would have vanished and the problems which had prompted the 1617 Act would have re-emerged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	681	This did not happen , however , because the removal of the time-limit was only part of a much larger package of reforms that did away with the need actually to go to the lands and perform the sasine ceremony . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	682	It was enough to record an instrument of sasine , saying that sasine had been given in the lands . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	683	Not surprisingly , this new method of taking sasine proved popular because it saved a lot of time and trouble . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	684	But it worked only if the instrument of sasine was actually recorded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	685	So convenience became the compulsitor for registration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	686	Some years later , under sections 1 and 2 of the Titles to Land Act -LRB- Scotland -RRB- 1858 , now sections 15 and 16 of the Titles to Land Consolidation -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1868 , the same effect could be achieved by recording the disposition or a notarial instrument , without any need to expede and record an instrument of sasine . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	687	So in most cases recording the conveyance became the equivalent of taking infeftment by receiving sasine . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	688	Finally , under section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Conveyancing -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1874 , infeftment by registration came to imply entry with the nearest feudal superior . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	689	92 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	690	Since 1874 , therefore , registration has been the means by which the disponee has become infeft and has been entered with the feudal superior . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	691	In other words , it is the means by which the disponee obtains a real right or feudal right in the subjects - and he does so without the need for any further involvement on the part of the disponer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	692	Under the modern system , once the disponer has delivered the disposition , his work is done : he need do no more than refrain from interfering . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	693	93 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	694	Feudal investiture is necessary not only for the creation of a real right of ownership in land , but also for the creation of certain lesser real rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	695	In particular , subject to an exception that is no longer relevant , if a creditor adjudges land in security of his debt , then , to complete a real right that will be effective against other adjudgers or voluntary disponees , such as purchasers , he must become infeft - formerly by going through much the same procedures as were used for transferring ownership and recording the instrument of sasine in the register , nowadays by recording the decree of adjudication : section 62 of the Titles to Land -LRB- Consolidation -RRB- -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1868 , as substituted by section 62 of the Conveyancing -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1874 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	696	Recording is what makes an adjudication `` effectual '' for the purposes of the Diligence Act 1661 and the Adjudication Act 1672 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	697	Moreover , under the Real Rights Act 1693 in any competition the date of registration of the decree determines priority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	698	Failure to register 94 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	699	Since registration is now the means of taking sasine , it follows that any disponee who fails to record the disposition has not taken sasine and is not infeft . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	700	His position is therefore distinguishable from that of a purchaser before 1845 who had taken sasine , but who had failed to record the instrument of sasine within the sixty days prescribed by the 1617 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	701	The relevant wording of the Act was extremely obscure and so , for more than two hundred years , the effect of a failure to register the instrument of sasine remained doubtful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	702	In Young v Leith -LRB- 1844 -RRB- 6 D 370 ; -LRB- 1847 -RRB- 9 D 932 ; -LRB- 1848 -RRB- 2 Ross 's LC 81 , however , it was finally settled that unrecorded instruments of sasine were nullities , but the granter of the sasine was not entitled to plead the nullity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	703	Lord Campbell concluded his speech in your Lordships ' House with this flourish , 2 Ross 's LC 81 , 108 : '' ... I am very glad that the result is such as my noble friend proposes , and that now , on the authority of this House , it will be clearly taken as the law of Scotland , that unrecorded sasines are a nullity . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	704	Mr Hodge placed considerable emphasis on Lord Campbell 's words as demonstrating the central rôle which recording deeds in the register plays in Scots law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	705	In my respectful opinion , however , this statement is of no conceivable relevance in the law of today and reference to it can only serve to introduce confusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	706	Under the modern law there are , for all practical purposes , no separate grants of sasine and so the problem of the status of an unrecorded sasine , which Lord Campbell was so happy to see resolved , no longer exists . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	707	Today infeftment is taken - and is only taken - by the very act of recording the disposition or notice of title , which is regarded as the equivalent of taking sasine . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	708	The appellants ' problem is simply that they did not record the disposition , and so are not to be regarded as having taken sasine , until after the respondent had recorded his notice of title . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	709	The true issue today is what effect , if any , is to be given to rights , such as those of uninfeft proprietors , which do not appear on the register . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	710	The position of the uninfeft proprietor 95 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	711	At the time when Mrs Burnett was sequestrated , the appellants were disponees to whom the disponer had delivered the disposition but who had not yet recorded it in the register and were accordingly not yet infeft . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	712	Even if only for a short period , this is a stage through which all purchasers of land must pass and so the nature of their rights is of some importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	713	Sometimes , as in section 31 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1985 Act , such a person is simply said to hold an `` uncompleted title '' to the land ; or , more fully , he may be described as a person having an interest in land `` but whose title thereto has not been completed by recording '' : section 12 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform Act 1970 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	714	Writers may try to capture the nature of his position by saying that he holds a `` personal title '' -LRB- eg Craigie , Scottish Law of Conveyancing : Heritable Rights -LRB- 3rd edition , 1899 -RRB- , p 434 -RRB- , while it has long been common practice to describe him as `` proprietor '' , as opposed to `` heritable proprietor '' , of the lands : eg Erskine , Institute of the Law of Scotland 2.6.51 ; Craigie , Heritable Rights , p 436 , dealing with the drafting of deeds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	715	In M'Adam v M'Adam -LRB- 1879 -RRB- 6 R 1256 , 1258 Lord President Inglis referred to `` the owner of a personal right to land '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	716	The fluctuations in terminology are suggestive of a certain instability in the thinking about the uninfeft proprietor 's position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	717	In recent years the question has prompted both academic and judicial analysis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	718	The opinions of the judges of the First Division in Sharp v Thomson 1995 SC 455 discuss the matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	719	96 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	720	Rather than go over the same ground , I draw particular attention to certain observations of the Whole Court in Earl of Fife v Duff -LRB- 1862 -RRB- 24 D 936 on the `` personal fee '' , as they call it , of the uninfeft proprietor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	721	Although in Sharp v Thomson 1997 SC -LRB- HL -RRB- 66 , 70 , 84 , both Lord Jauncey and Lord Clyde alluded to these observations in passing , for some reason they have tended to be given less prominence than might have been expected in discussions of the topic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	722	97 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	723	The Earl of Fife and his trustees sought a declarator that they had power to sell certain lands and to receive the price and use it at their pleasure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	724	The defenders included the heirs called to the succession by various deeds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	725	Some of the heirs contended that the lands in question were subject to an entail and so could not be sold . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	726	The First Division rejected the contentions for the Earl and his trustees and assoilzied the defenders : Earl of Fife v Duff -LRB- 1861 -RRB- 23 D 657 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	727	The pursuers appealed to this House which instructed that the case should be argued before the whole judges and that their opinions should be reported to the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	728	This was done and a single opinion was returned by the Whole Court with the exception of Lord Mackenzie , who was absent due to illness : Earl of Fife v Duff -LRB- 1862 -RRB- 24 D 936 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	729	98 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	730	The opinion of the Whole Court began by setting out the well-established rules relating to the transmission of the ownership of feudal subjects . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	731	They explained that voluntary transmission of such subjects was effected by a dispositive act followed by tradition of the subject to the transferee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	732	To explain the nature of the dispositive act , they cited Stair , Institutions of the Law of Scotland 3.2.3 , including his comment - apparently directed at the natural law position - that the words of conveyance `` express something presently done , and not engaged to be done ; and so can be nothing else but the alienation or transmission of the right itself . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	733	Their Lordships observed , at p 941 : `` Thus the legal effect of such a disposition , even before it is followed by tradition of the subject disponed , is twofold . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	734	In the first place , it operates as an actual alienation of the subject to the disponee ; and it vests in him most of the essential attributes of ownership . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	735	In particular it vests in him not only a right to possess the subject and to reap its fruits but also a power to sell it ; to dispone it for either onerous or gratuitous causes ; and to settle the estate by mortis causa dispositions and deeds of entail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	736	The right so created is transmissible from one person to another by voluntary disposition ; and on the death of any person , in whom it is vested , it is transmissible to his heir by general service ; and each person in whom it is vested successively has the powers and privileges of ownership above mentioned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	737	This right is usually called a personal fee - a denomination importing not that the subject of it is moveable , for it is truly heritable , but that it is not feudal , and indicating at the same time that , even while not followed by solemn tradition or infeftment , the right is still sua natura a right of fee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	738	Secondly , such dispositive act , although it operates as a de praesenti alienation , and not merely as an obligation to alienate , does farther by implication impose upon the disponer an obligation of a different kind - viz a consequent obligation -LRB- as Lord Stair calls it -RRB- - as to delivery or tradition of the subject disponed . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	739	Having described in some detail the two modes of feudal `` tradition '' by which the disponer could perform his obligation as to the delivery or tradition of the land , the court continued , at p 942 : `` Although the personal fee , thus vested in a disponee before he is infeft , confers upon him such powers and privileges of ownership , it is , while in that state , attended with some risks and disadvantages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	740	One of them is , that the owner is not the entered vassal of the feudal superior . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	741	Another is , that as his right is not clothed with infeftment , and published in the Register of Sasines , it is of no effect against third parties who may attach the estate by legal execution for the debts of the disponer , or who may in bona fide purchase it from him , and be first infeft . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	742	And still another disadvantage -LRB- which may often be of moment in cases relating to the titles of entailed estates -RRB- is , that when the disposition is granted under conditions intended to burden or restrict the disponee 's right in favour of third parties , as creditors , or as heirs of entail , these conditions can not be rendered real burdens upon the estate without being embodied in the infeftment of the disponee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	743	But a personal fee , while in these and some other respects is not equivalent to a fully feudalised fee , still leaves the person to whom it belongs vested with the important powers and privileges of ownership formerly mentioned , and with a right , in addition , to call upon the disponer , or his heir , to grant a proper warrant for clothing the personal fee with feudal tradition . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	744	99 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	745	This analysis by the Whole Court of the nature of the personal fee was critical to their decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	746	Discussing the nature of the deed granted by Major George Skene in 1721 , they held , at pp 943-944 : `` It was itself a substantive and de praesenti disposition to a certain disponee , and to a certain series of heirs of entail , with all the restrictions prescribed by that statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	747	It was thus itself a habile entail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	748	It is true that Major Skene 's right under that entail was still only such a personal fee as has been described , and that in order to render its conditions and restrictions real burdens upon the estate , three proceedings were still requisite . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	749	Similarly , describing the situation of Elizabeth Skene , who by her general service had taken the personal fee out of Major Skene 's haereditas jacens , the court said , at p 947 : `` In virtue of that title she had all the powers and privileges of ownership arising from a personal fee as formerly mentioned , excepting in so far as these powers and privileges were restricted by the entail ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	750	No doubt , while her right under the entail remained only personal , and the conditions in favour of the heirs of entail were not made real burdens upon the lands by her being infeft in them under these burdens , the rights of these subsequent heirs of entail were exposed to the risk of being defeated , in the manner already explained , - that is to say , by third parties obtaining themselves first infeft in the land , in virtue either of onerous and bona fide purchases from the heirs-at-law of the entailer , or of legal execution for payment of the onerous debts of such heirs , if these heirs should , in that character , have made up a feudal title to the lands . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	751	But , subject to that risk , the personal fee was vested in Elizabeth Skene by the deed of entail itself , and her general service as heir of entail ; and a jus crediti was created in favour of the subsequent heirs of entail . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	752	100 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	753	When after four days of argument your Lordships ' House affirmed the decision of the Court of Session , -LRB- 1863 -RRB- 4 Macq 469 , it was on the basis of that analysis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	754	For instance , Lord Westbury LC said , at p 487 , that Major Skene 's settlement remained effectual `` as a disposition of the personal fee , although the parties entitled under it would be obliged to resort to some other mode of obtaining a feudal tradition of the subject . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	755	He went on to say , at p 488 , that , despite subsequent actings by Major Skene , the settlement `` remained what it originally was , an actual immediate conveyance , giving right to , and capable of receiving , feudal investment , and consequently possessing the elements of a habile entail . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	756	101 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	757	As the law stands today , the uninfeft proprietor is in much the same position as at the time of the decision of the Whole Court and of this House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	758	He has the right to possess the subjects and to reap the fruits , including taking the rents ; he has the power to sell the subjects and , by deducing title , to dispone them for either onerous or gratuitous causes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	759	When he dies , his right to the subjects forms part of his heritable , as opposed to his moveable , estate for purposes of legal rights : Stair , Institutions of the Law of Scotland 3.5.6 ; Succession -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1964 , section 10 -LRB- 2 -RRB- ; cf Gloag and Henderson , The Law of Scotland -LRB- 11th edition , 2001 -RRB- , para 36.07 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	760	Subject to that Act , the uninfeft proprietor can bequeath the subjects in his will . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	761	In addition under section 12 of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1970 he can grant a standard security over the subjects . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	762	In one very real sense , however , the position of the uninfeft proprietor has actually moved on since 1862 - and even more so since the eighteenth century when the deeds under consideration in the Earl of Fife 's case were executed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	763	Even in 1862 an uninfeft proprietor required the active involvement of the feudal superior if his infeftment was to become public , but since the Conveyancing -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1874 , once infeft , a disponee has been deemed to be entered automatically with his superior . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope, lord rodger
104	764	So an uninfeft proprietor has it in his own power to do everything necessary to become infeft and so to vest the real or feudal right in himself , simply by recording the disposition in the register . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	765	If anything , therefore , the position of an uninfeft proprietor vis à vis the granter of the disposition has been strengthened . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	766	102 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	767	The decision of the Whole Court , as affirmed by this House , in the Earl of Fife 's case therefore constitutes the most authoritative possible licence for describing the holder of the personal fee , personal title or uncompleted title as an `` owner '' and his rights as `` powers and privileges of ownership '' : the execution and delivery of the disposition can be said to vest in him `` most of the essential attributes of ownership '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	768	The Whole Court and your Lordships ' House would therefore have found little to quarrel in the well-known passage in Lord President Emslie 's opinion in Gibson v Hunter Home Designs Ltd -LRB- in liquidation -RRB- 1976 SC 23 , 27 : `` In the law of Scotland no right of property vests in a purchaser until there has been delivered to him the relevant disposition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	769	On delivery of the disposition the purchaser becomes vested in a personal right to the subjects in question and his acquisition of a real right to the subjects is dependent upon recording the disposition in the appropriate Register of Sasines . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	770	Putting the matter in another way the seller of subjects under missives is not , in a question with the purchaser , divested of any part of his right of property in the subjects of sale until , in implement of his contractual obligation to do so , he delivers to the purchaser the appropriate disposition . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	771	In the distinguished company of Lord President M'Neill , Lord Justice Clerk Inglis and the other judges of the Court of Session - not to mention your Lordships ' House - Lord President Emslie can scarcely be accused of unorthodoxy , far less of heresy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	772	Moreover , whatever criticisms might now be made of the language or reasoning in Earl of Fife v Duff would be pointless quibbles when the passage has stood for more than 150 years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	773	For present purposes , the case is useful as marking the high point in the authorities characterising uninfeft proprietors , like the appellants , as having the powers and privileges of owners . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	774	Indeed , although Mr Hodge frequently referred to uninfeft proprietors , such as the appellants , as the `` creditors '' of the granter of the disposition , in reality there is nothing by way of positive action that they can or need demand of the granter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	775	All that they want , and can or need demand , is that the granter leave them alone and do nothing to prevent them completing their title . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	776	Seen from the other side , in practice the only obligation of the granter is to leave them alone and do nothing to prevent them completing their title . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	777	103 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	778	But it is important to notice that , however far the judges went in describing the uninfeft proprietor as an owner in Earl of Fife v Duff , what he had was a `` personal fee '' , with the corresponding obligations on the disponer being personal obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	779	The personal fee had indeed the characteristics of a personal right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	780	104 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	781	For one thing , the right was transferred by assignation - in due course under section 22 of the Titles to Land Consolidation -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1868 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	782	Even after section 3 of the Conveyancing -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1924 made it possible for an uninfeft disponer to deduce title from the person last infeft , such assignations remained competent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	783	In practice , however , the convenience of the new system meant that they fell into desuetude after 1924 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	784	They were eventually abolished by section 48 of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1970 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	785	105 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	786	More importantly , perhaps , the judges of the Whole Court in the Earl of Fife 's case quite specifically pointed out , 24 D 936 , 942 , that the uninfeft proprietor 's personal fee was of no effect against third parties who might attach the estate by legal execution for the debts of the disponer , or who might in bona fide purchase it from him , and be first infeft . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	787	For present purposes this means that the personal fee was held to be of no effect against adjudgers and bona fide purchasers who were first infeft . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	788	That remains the position today . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	789	106 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	790	With this introduction , I can now turn to see how the law that applies to the present case has developed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	791	Section 31 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1985 Act 107 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	792	In critical respects the language of section 31 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1985 Act repeats the language of earlier bankruptcy statutes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	793	Parliament first says that by virtue of the act and warrant the whole estate of the debtor vests in the permanent trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	794	The relevant picture is therefore not of the permanent trustee stepping into the shoes of the debtor , but of the debtor 's estate being taken from her and placed in the hands of a completely different individual , the trustee for the debtor 's creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	795	This suggests that , in so far as the debtor herself may be subject to personal obligations , those obligations do not affect this new person , the permanent trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	796	That is , of course , consistent with the general rule in sequestrations that the permanent trustee is not bound by contracts entered into by the debtor unless he expressly or impliedly adopts them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	797	108 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	798	Section 31 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- then explains precisely what is meant by the heritable estate vesting in this way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	799	The particular form of vesting was originally chosen to allay any alarm that applying sequestration to heritable estate would subvert the feudal principles of transmission , upon which the whole system of heritable conveyances was built : Bell , Commentaries on the Laws of Scotland -LRB- 5th edition , 1826 -RRB- , Vol 1 , p 400 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	800	The wording of the present provision is rather obscure but its interpretation is perhaps helped by noticing that it derives from the rather clearer words of section 23 of the Act of 1793 -LRB- 33 Geo III , c 74 -RRB- : `` which adjudication being of the nature of an adjudication in implement , as well as for payment or security of debt , shall be subject to no legal reversion . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	801	The model for vesting is based on adjudication which `` is a judicial disposition to the subject '' : Bankton , Institute of the Laws of Scotland 3.2.49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	802	109 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	803	First , the act and warrant from the sheriff has the same effect as if a decree of adjudication in implement of sale had been pronounced in favour of the permanent trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	804	Since an adjudication in implement is a way of obtaining specific implement of a seller 's obligation to convey property , armed with his decree or judicial disposition , the trustee can proceed to infeft himself as owner - nowadays by recording a notice of title on the register , as the respondent did in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	805	110 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	806	Section 31 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- then says that the act and warrant has the same effect as if a decree of adjudication for payment and in security of debt , subject to no legal reversion , had been pronounced in favour of the permanent trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	807	Normally , an adjudger initially acquires only a right to the subjects which is redeemable within ten years on payment of the debt , but the effect of this part of section 31 -LRB- 1 -RRB- is to confer `` a right of absolute property in the trustee , for the benefit of the creditors , according to their rights and interests at the time '' : Mansfield v Walker 's Trs -LRB- 1833 -RRB- 11 S 813 , 829 - 830 per Lord Craigie . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	808	Again , the trustee 's right under the judicial disposition will be converted into a real or feudal right only if he records a notice of title in the register , as the respondent did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	809	111 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	810	At first sight it looks as if the legislature has piled Pelion upon Ossa , since both the adjudication in implement and the adjudication for payment and in security result in the trustee having an absolute right of property on infeftment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	811	But , in actual fact , giving the act and warrant the effect of an adjudication for payment and in security is significant because it is one of the ways in which the law of sequestration builds upon the pre-existing law of adjudication for debt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	812	In particular , the trustee in sequestration is to be treated as an adjudger for payment with a decree in his favour for the benefit of the creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	813	And it is because he is treated as an adjudging creditor , and not merely as a purchaser , of the debtor 's heritable estate that the trustee can set out to destroy the rights of uninfeft purchasers of that estate by infefting himself before they do . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	814	A purchaser could not do this : Rodger -LRB- Builders -RRB- v Fawdry 1950 SC 583 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	815	Adjudgers and prior personal rights 112 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	816	The eighteenth and nineteenth century case law which I must now examine bears witness to a prolonged struggle to define the position of creditors who obtain a decree of adjudication against their debtor 's estate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	817	At an early stage it was accepted that bona fide purchasers were not affected by personal rights against the seller which were not recorded in the register . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	818	After all , such purchasers could be taken to have consulted the register and to have proceeded on the information about the seller 's title to be found there . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	819	The same could be said of creditors who insisted on the debtor providing them with a heritable security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	820	Both groups transacted on the faith of the register . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	821	But , it was argued , creditors who used adjudication to obtain a security over their debtor 's property were different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	822	They had originally chosen to lend money or to transact with the debtor either without taking any security at all or else on the basis of a personal security , such as caution from a third party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	823	At all events , these creditors had not relied on the debtor 's land for security and had not therefore relied on his title to the land as set out in the register . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	824	So , if it turned out that the debtor had entered into personal obligations relating to the land , such creditors could not claim to have been misled by the unqualified nature of his title in the deeds recorded in the register . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	825	If they proceeded to adjudge their debtor 's property , there was therefore no reason why they should be in any better position than the debtor himself on whom they had chosen to rely : they should take his property tantum et tale , subject to any personal obligations , including obligations to uninfeft purchasers , that affected his right to the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	826	So ran the argument that was eventually to fail - but only after a valiant fight by its proponents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	827	A trio of cases 113 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	828	For present purposes the story begins with the seminal case , Bell v Gartshore -LRB- 1737 -RRB- M 2848 ; 5 Br Suppl 198 ; 2 Ross 's LC 410 ; Arniston Collection of Session Papers Vol 7 -LRB- 1720 - 1737 -RRB- No 51 -LRB- Advocates Library -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	829	Alexander Oliphant bought a tenement in Kelso which was being sold by the adjudging creditors of William Chatto . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	830	Without becoming infeft , in 1730 Oliphant disponed the decree of sale to Chatto 's son , who also was not infeft . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	831	Two years later Chatto junior granted a heritable bond to Bell of Blackethouse who had paid two bills of exchange for him and was entitled to relief . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	832	Bell entered into possession but was not infeft . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	833	In 1734 John Gartshore , another creditor of Chatto junior , adjudged the decree of sale of the tenement from him and obtained a charter of resignation from the superior , the Duke of Roxburgh , on which he was infeft . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	834	A question arose as to the respective entitlements of Chatto junior 's two creditors , Bell and Gartshore . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	835	The critical issue was whether , by granting the heritable bond , Chatto junior had denuded himself of his entire personal right to the tenement , with the result that , when Gartshore purported to adjudge it from him , there was nothing left to be carried by the adjudication . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	836	Apparently at the insistence of Lord Kilkerran , the Court of Session reconsidered their original decision in favour of Bell . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	837	Departing from certain earlier cases , the court , presided over by the newly installed Lord President Forbes of Culloden , eventually held , by a majority , that the granting of the heritable bond did not denude Chatto junior of his personal right to the tenement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	838	It followed that the adjudication operated so as to vest that personal right in Gartshore . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	839	Since Gartshore was infeft and Bell was not , Gartshore 's right was to be preferred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	840	114 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	841	Counsel for Bell - Andrew M'Douall , the future Lord Bankton and institutional writer - sought to argue that the case was concerned with nothing more than the effect of a personal conveyance by an uninfeft proprietor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	842	The importance of the case for present purposes lies in the successful contrary submission for Gartshore , apparently written by Robert Dundas of Arniston - who had , however , been appointed to the bench as Lord Arniston a few days before the crucial penultimate hearing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	843	The argument was to this effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	844	The heritable bond granted by Chatto junior to Bell was , indeed , merely a personal conveyance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	845	There was no provision for recording such a personal conveyance in the register . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	846	It followed that , if the effect of such a personal conveyance were that it denuded the granter of all his rights in the subjects , then anyone purchasing from him would in fact acquire nothing - even though the purchaser would have no way of knowing this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	847	If the purchaser then went on to become infeft and to record the instrument of sasine , anyone consulting the register would be misled into thinking that the purchaser had a valid title , when in fact he had no title at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	848	It was no answer to say that any subsequent purchaser would be secure because he had purchased on the faith of the record , since there was no law that protected a purchaser against latent claims that did not appear on the face of the records . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	849	Therefore , for the system of registration to work , the underlying assumption must be that unfeudalised personal conveyances did not denude the granter , whether he was infeft or uninfeft . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	850	Counsel summarised his argument in this way , at p 2852 : `` A latent conveyance , by a person not infeft , is none of those grounds of challenge that are appointed to be recorded ; and therefore , supposing such a latent conveyance to be good in its nature against a purchaser , the records will not secure him , nor anything else , but the positive prescription of 40 years . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	851	Lord Kilkerran observed , 5 Br Suppl , 198 , 199 : `` 1mo , I have ever held it as a point , that he who first completes the real right , or in other words , he who first denudes the person last infeft , has the preferable right to the lands ; and herein lies the mistake of the advocates for Bell , that they still speak of denuding of the personal right , when truly that is not the question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	852	For the personal right is not the subject of competition ; it is the real right to the lands . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	853	What else is the personal right but an obligation on the person last infeft , and a power given to the disponee to denude the granter by a procuratory or precept ; and the only question is , who denudes him first ; not who gets the first transmission of that power ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	854	Lord Kilkerran 's third point , at p 199 , was : `` 3tio , Suppose the second assignee to the personal right infefts and conveys , that purchaser is safe ex concessis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	855	But upon what foundation can that be true , if his author derived his right a non habente ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	856	It is no answer that the purchaser from one infeft is safe because he purchases upon the faith of the records ; for I know no statute that provides that a purchaser on the faith of the records is safe : no law has said so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger

104	858	But if any deed be of its nature effectual , which the law has not required to be recorded , it will remain effectual , and be a gap in our security from the records : so I take the consequence of the doctrine to be unavoidable , that the purchaser from the second assignee infeft can not be safe , and consequently our records are no longer a security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	859	The distinction that is put between purchasing from one infeft , and from one not infeft , resolves into this , that we will stop short , and not contradict the principles of law , in that case also , when disposition is from one infeft ; for in reality there is nothing in the distinction .

104	861	In his Institute of the Law of Scotland 2.7.26 , written between 1765 and 1768 , Erskine stated the law in the light of this case as follows : `` By our former practice , where a person not infeft in lands disponed his right first to one and afterward to another , the first disponee was preferred to the subject , upon this ground , that one whose right to lands were merely personal , which is no more than a jus obligationis , may divest himself fully by any personal deed properly expressing his will to transfer the right ; so that after the first disposition , no right is left in the disponer which can be carried by the second ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	862	But this rule , besides that it is not justly applicable to feudal rights , which require seisin to perfect them , rendered the security of singular successors precarious , since there is no necessity of registering any personal right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	863	It is therefore fixed by the later practice that the granter of a personal right of lands is not so divested by a first disposition but that he may effectually make over the right to another , either by voluntary or judicial conveyance ; and that the preference between the two disponees ought to be settled not according to the dates of the several grants , because they can not be discovered by the records , but according to the priority of the seisins following on them ; Bell , 22 June 1737 .

104	865	Although Bell v Gartshore was specifically concerned with the position of an adjudger , within a few years , for the kinds of reason that I have outlined in paragraph 112 , the court came to draw a distinction between adjudgers and bona fide purchasers from an infeft proprietor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	866	Such an argument certainly found favour in Ireland v Neilson -LRB- 1755 -RRB- 5 Br Supp 828 where the debtor had acquired the land by fraud : it was held that the adjudgers were affected by the debtor 's fraud , even if a purchaser would not have been .

104	869	But any possible trend against adjudgers received a check in Douglas v Adjudging Creditors of Kelhead -LRB- 1765 -RRB- 3 Ross 's LC 169 ; sub nom Douglas v Stewarts M 15616 ; Campbell Collection of Session Papers Vol 64 -LRB- 1792 -RRB- No 43 -LRB- Advocates Library -RRB- .

104	870	Counsel for the adjudgers was Robert MacQueen , the future Lord Braxfield and a noted authority on feudal law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	871	In 1705 Sir William Douglas had bound himself in his marriage contract to provide the estate of Kelhead in favour of himself and the heirs-male of his body . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	872	He failed to carry out that obligation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	873	Instead , in 1724 he executed a strict entail of the lands , which was recorded in the register of tailzies , but no infeftment followed upon it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	874	He died in 1733 and , eventually , in 1751 his son , Sir John Douglas , succeeded in having the entail reduced on the ground that Sir William had had no power to entail the estate of Kelhead since it had been provided to the heirs of the marriage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	875	Sir John was then infeft in fee simple in the estate and proceeded to borrow large sums . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	876	In due course , during Sir John 's lifetime , a process of ranking and sale of the estate was brought at the instance of his creditors , some being heritable creditors infeft and others being personal creditors who had adjudged and one of whom was infeft . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	877	Sir John 's eldest son , Captain Douglas , objected to the sale on the ground that , by serving heir to Sir William , his father had barred himself from reducing the entail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	878	The creditors argued that , even supposing that the reduction of the entail could be taken out of the way , this could not affect their debts since the feudal right of the estate was vested in Sir John as a fee-simple without any fetters or limitations whatever and so it was liable for the payment of all his personal debts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	879	In other words the entail would never be more than a personal right which would not affect the creditors , since it had not been feudalised by infeftment and recording in the register of sasines . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	880	The Court of Session upheld this argument , in respect of both the heritable creditors and the adjudging personal creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope, lord rodger
104	881	Captain Douglas reclaimed against the interlocutor in respect of the adjudging personal creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	882	The court adhered to its decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	883	118 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	884	The argument of James Burnett , the future Lord Monboddo , for Captain Douglas was that there was a great distinction between the heritable creditors , who had contracted on the faith of the records in the register , and the adjudging creditors who had lent their money on personal bonds and who could not therefore be said to have contracted upon the faith of the records . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	885	-LRB- The general creditors in the present case are in a broadly similar position . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	886	Mr Burnett argued that such a personal creditor could not be in a better condition than his debtor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	887	When he lent money to the debtor , he got no more than the debtor 's promise to repay it and , when he subsequently adjudged the debtor 's property , this was simply a method of operating payment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	888	Mr MacQueen 's argument for the adjudgers was to the effect that in law all of Sir John 's creditors , irrespective of whether they were infeft on a heritable security or they adjudged in security of their debts , trusted their money on the faith of his infeftment in the estate , as appearing from the records . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	889	The argument continued , 3 Ross 's LC 169 , 172 : `` For the law looks to the situation of the estate at the time the creditors lent their money , and holds , that a creditor lending his money to a person standing infeft in an estate in fee simple , or before the tailzie is recorded , contracts with that person upon the faith of the public records , as much as he who lends his money to him upon an heritable bond and infeftment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	890	If the last is secured in his real right against the challenge of an after heir of entail , so also must the former be secure in the legal effect and operation of his personal debt upon an estate which stood vested in his debtor in fee simple at the time of the contract . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	891	Since the creditors had carried the estate by adjudication and infeftment , the personal deed of entail could not compete . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	892	119 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	893	The adjudging creditors won . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	894	Although the opinions of the judges are not reported , Lord Monboddo recorded , at pp 173 - 174 , that the court took the case upon the general point that `` no entail can be effectual against a purchaser , creditor by heritable bond , or adjudger , unless completed by infeftment ... . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	895	In Black and Grant v Gordon -LRB- 1794 -RRB- 3 Pat 317 Lord Justice Clerk Braxfield followed this decision in another case where an entail had been recorded in the register of tailzies but infeftment had not followed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	896	Dismissing an appeal from that decision , your Lordships ' House rejected the appellants ' argument that the adjudging creditors could not claim to have relied on the title as it stood in the register of sasines . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	897	120 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	898	The dispute about the position of adjudgers came to a head in Mitchells v Ferguson -LRB- 1781 -RRB- M 10296 ; Hailes 879 ; 3 Ross 's LC 120 ; Faculty Collection Session Papers , December 1780 - February 1781 , No 35 -LRB- Advocates Library -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger

104	900	A simplified version suffices for present purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	901	In 1768 William Donald sold his house to Agnes Carson but , pending payment , the disposition was held by Donald 's man of business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	902	As found by the Lord Ordinary -LRB- Monboddo -RRB- , the price was paid by a certain William Ferguson , on the basis that Carson would grant him a heritable bond or a disposition in security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	903	When she failed to do so , Ferguson raised proceedings for implement of this obligation and obtained a decree in absence on 4 July 1777 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	904	The following month , on 9 August 1777 , the Mitchells , as creditors of Donald , obtained a decree of adjudication of the house against him and were infeft . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	905	Carson , however , raised a multiplepoinding and suspension of the decree in absence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	906	The question was whether , by reason of the adjudication , the Mitchells took the title to the house subject to the obligations of Donald under the sale to Carson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	907	The Lord Ordinary , relying on Ireland v Neilson and Gibb v Livingston , held that Donald 's creditors could not carry off the house by adjudication except under the burden of the previous sale . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	908	The Mitchells reclaimed and a hearing in presence was ordered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	909	The reclaiming motion was allowed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	910	Lord Monboddo dissenting , the court held , M 10296 , 10299 , that `` the adjudication and infeftment following upon it are preferable to the personal disposition founded on by Ferguson . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	911	121 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	912	In Sharp v Thomson 1997 SC -LRB- HL -RRB- 66 , 74G - H Lord Jauncey distinguished Mitchells v Ferguson on the ground that the disposition had been delivered to Donald 's man of business and not to Carson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	913	But , although it does indeed appear from the pleadings that the disposition was delivered to Donald 's man of business pending payment of the price and was never physically delivered to Carson , there is nothing to suggest that this was regarded as important once the price had actually been paid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	914	Lord Jauncey suggested that , to judge from his language , in Heritable Reversionary Company v Millar -LRB- 1892 -RRB- 19 R -LRB- HL -RRB- 43 , 48 Lord Watson must have understood Mitchells v Ferguson as a case where the seller had not delivered the disposition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	915	But the report of the argument in the Appeal Cases , -LSB- 1892 -RSB- AC 578 , 601 , 603 , suggests that counsel for both parties proceeded - rightly - on the basis that in Mitchells the disposition was to be treated as having been delivered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	916	Moreover , as will appear below , Lord Watson did not question the line of cases founded on Mitchells . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	917	122 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	918	At a general level , in Mitchells v Ferguson the court rejected the submission that the distinction between the position of a purchaser and the position of an adjudger had been overlooked in Bell v Gartshore . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	919	Lord Braxfield said , 3 Ross 's LC 120 , 125 , that `` there never was a cause judged with more solemnity , nor by abler judges and lawyers , than the cause of Bell of Blackethouse '' ; if the distinction between a purchaser and adjudger was not `` stirred '' there , this was not because it was not thought of , but because counsel must have been of the opinion that it was not tenable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	920	The Lord President , the second Lord President Dundas of Arniston , listed , at p 126 , a number of distinguished judges , including his father , who had all regarded Bell v Gartshore as fixed law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	921	123 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	922	The first argument for Ferguson has a bearing on one of the arguments for the appellants in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	923	Mr Gale submitted that , since Mrs Burnett could not have sold and disponed the flat without being guilty of fraud , the bare title should not be regarded as vesting in the trustee in her sequestration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	924	In Mitchells v Ferguson counsel for Ferguson argued that , since a person who grants a second disposition in fraudem of the first is guilty of a crime , the law will not compel any man to do this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	925	It would be equally repugnant to common sense and to law for the court , in an action of adjudication , to put itself in the position of the debtor and in effect to grant the adjudger the title that it would not have forced the debtor to grant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	926	In other words , if it would have been fraud on the part of Donald to dispone the house to the Mitchells , the court should not grant decree of adjudication of the house from him to the Mitchells . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	927	In rejecting this argument Lord Braxfield observed , at p 125 , that a bankrupt can not grant a disposition to any particular creditor , but `` will it thence follow that his creditors can not adjudge because it would have been fraudulent in his debtor to give him a voluntary right ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	928	Similarly , in the present case , the mere fact that Mrs Burnett could not have disponed the house to a third party without committing a crime is no reason to hold that an individual creditor can not adjudge or that under section 31 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1985 Act the act and warrant does not have the effect of an adjudication of her right in the flat to the trustee in her sequestration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	929	124 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	930	The second argument for Ferguson - which is also of importance for the present case - was that a bona fide second purchaser , who obtained information about the subjects from the register , would be deceived if he were cut out from his purchase by a personal and latent deed of the seller . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	931	An adjudging creditor , however , who did not contract in reliance on the register but trusted solely to the personal security , could no more exclude an anterior disponee without infeftment than he could exclude an anterior disponee whose infeftment appeared in the register . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	932	The adjudger had no bona fides to plead in relation either to his debtor or to the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	933	An adjudger must be content to take that which he had adjudged , tantum et tale , as it stood in the person of his debtor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	934	Counsel for the Mitchells argued that the principle to be applied had been established in Bell v Gartshore : personal deeds can not affect feudal rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	935	And it was this principle , and not any application of bona fides , that explained why a second disponee once infeft excludes a prior disponee remaining uninfeft . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	936	125 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	937	In the later case of Russell v Ross 's Creditors 31 January 1792 FC ; M 10300 ; sub nom Pierse v Ross 3 Ross 's LC 177 , 180 Lord Braxfield was to declare that not one portion in his memorial in Douglas v Adjudging Creditors of Kelhead `` but in my opinion is founded on the feudal law of Scotland . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	938	It is clear that in Mitchells v Ferguson he applied that approach - while , in much the same way , Lord Monboddo dissented on the basis of his argument as opposing counsel in that case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	939	In Lord Monboddo 's view , 3 Ross 's LC 120 , 126 , the result reached by the majority was unjust : `` Here the price was honestly paid ; possession was held for seven years ; and the purchaser was in the course of completing his titles : a personal creditor steps in , adjudges , is infeft , and now seeks to carry off the subject . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	940	This is unjust . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	941	In Lord Braxfield 's view , on the other hand , all creditors , irrespective of whether or not they had relied on the register when transacting with the debtor , were to be regarded as having available for payment of their debts the debtor 's heritable estate unqualified by any unrecorded personal rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	942	Lord Braxfield considered that Ferguson 's argument to the contrary was potentially dangerous because it would lead to fraud . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	943	For instance , a debtor might grant a heritable bond to a creditor with a warrant to infeft and the creditor might not take an infeftment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	944	Other creditors , seeing the debtor in right of the estate and with no burden on the records , might lend large sums of money . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	945	The heritable creditor would only have to turn up , produce his heritable right and tell the creditors that there was nothing for them since they could only take the estate with the burdens that were competent against the debtor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	946	The same would apply to marriage contract trustees who chose to leave the husband in possession and not to take an infeftment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	947	Lord Braxfield added , at p 125 : `` The principle of the feudal law is clear , that no feudal right can be burdened with a personal right ; and if the feudal right remains in the debtor , the adjudger takes it out of him by the adjudication . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	948	The statute of 1661 affords a strong argument in favour of the respondents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	949	The reason that dispositions are not ordered to be recorded is , that they are mere personal deeds . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	950	As the report of counsel 's argument , at p 123 , shows , in this passage `` 1661 '' is a misprint for `` 1617 '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	951	Lord Hailes reports the beginning of the passage in this form , Hailes 879 , 880 : `` A second disponee , with first infeftment , is preferred to the first disponee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	952	This is admitted : but it is said that the case is different as to adjudications , which take the estate , tantum et tale , as it was in the author . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	953	It is answered that feudal rights are not affected by personal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	954	As to bona fides , although mala fides may cut down a right , bona fides can not establish a right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	955	The act 1617 says nothing to the contrary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	956	Reversion qualifies an infeftment , however latent it may be . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	957	To prevent that inconvenience , the clause was thrown in in favour of purchasers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	958	Dispositions are not mentioned in the statute , for they do not affect the feudal right . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	959	The decision therefore seems to have proceeded on the basis of the fundamental point underlying the decision in Bell v Gartshore , that feudal rights were not affected by personal rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	960	And personal creditors who had not actually consulted the register when initially deciding to contract with the debtor were entitled to found on this principle , just as surely as purchasers or heritable creditors who had . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	961	The personal creditors could therefore adjudge the debtor 's heritable estate free of any personal obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	962	The rule in favour of adjudgers eventually prevails 126 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	963	Despite the solemn and , apparently , clear decision of the court about the position of adjudgers , in subsequent cases counsel continued to advance the argument that they should be treated differently from purchasers and heritable creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	964	For instance , the point was touched on in Thomson v Douglas , Heron & Co 15 November 1786 FC ; M 10229 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	965	Thomson had disponed land to a man of business to sell and apply the proceeds for the behoof of Thomson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	966	The disponee omitted to insert this qualification in the procuratory of sasine and it did not appear on the register . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	967	He then proceeded to borrow money and granted a heritable security in favour of Douglas , Heron & Co. . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	968	Other creditors adjudged the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	969	The court held that the allegations of fraud on the part of the disponee were irrelevant against the defenders ' heritable securities but that they were relevant as to the creditors who had adjudged the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	970	According to the Faculty Collection report , the court held , at p 454 , that it had been found in decisions , which for the stability of the law ought not to be departed from , that adjudgers must take the right of their debtor tantum et tale as it was in his person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	971	But the Folio Dictionary report records , M 10299 , that the point `` was little discussed ... and the court did not mean to lay down the rule in general , that adjudgers must take tantum et tale . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	972	127 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	973	However that may be , the decision raised sufficient doubts for Lord President Ilay Campbell to order a hearing in presence in Russell v Ross 's Creditors 31 January 1792 FC ; M 10300 ; sub nom Pierse v Ross 3 Ross 's LC 177 ; Campbell Collection of Session Papers Vol 64 -LRB- 1792 -RRB- No 40 -LRB- Advocates Library -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	974	The argument proceeded on the basis of the memorials written by Lord Braxfield and Lord Monboddo as counsel in Douglas v Adjudging Creditors of Kelhead : -LRB- 1792 -RRB- 3 Ross 's LC 177 , 180 and 185 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger

104	979	The argument continued to cause trouble , however , as is clear from Smith v Taylor 18 December 1795 , Bell , Treatise on the Law of Bankruptcy Vol 1 -LRB- 1800 -RRB- , p 52 note ; Commentaries on the Law of Scotland -LRB- 7th edition -LRB- 1870 -RRB- by J M'Laren -RRB- Vol 1 , p 308 note 3 .

104	980	A debtor , who was not infeft , borrowed money on a heritable bond . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	981	The creditor immediately took infeftment but this could not give him a real right since the debtor himself had not been infeft . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	982	The debtor was sequestrated and the trustee was careful to make up his title without infefting the debtor , by dropping him out of the feudal progress . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	983	The trustee thus had a real right , while the heritable creditor 's right remained personal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	984	The heritable creditor argued , however , that the trustee , as representing the general creditors , could not take any better right than stood in their debtor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	985	The Lord Ordinary rejected this argument but the heritable creditor reclaimed and his argument was upheld . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	986	Again , steps were taken to correct the position - this time , in Buchan v Farquharson 24 May 1797 FC ; M 2905 ; 3 Ross 's LC 137 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	987	On 28 June 1788 Robert Gordon assigned a personal bond for 3000 merks to the Reverend Robert Farquharson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	988	Gordon was sequestrated on 19 July and the assignation was intimated on 4 August , but Gordon 's estate did not vest in the trustee in bankruptcy until after that . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	989	The trustee brought an action against Farquharson to reduce the assignation , inter alia because it had not been intimated until after the sequestration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	990	The court assoilzied Farquharson on the ground that the assignation had been completed by intimation before Gordon 's estate had vested in the trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	991	A sequestration did not prevent a creditor from completing his right by any act independent of the consent of the debtor , such as intimating a previous assignation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	992	But the court also observed , FC at p 67 : `` The trustee on a bankrupt estate will be preferred to a creditor claiming on a voluntary disposition , granted before the sequestration , if the right of the trustee be first completed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	993	And therefore , the propriety of the decision , 8 December 1795 , Taylor and Smith against Marshall , in so far as it went upon the supposition that the trustee in such case is bound to make good the previous voluntary disposition , may be doubted .

104	994	Bell records , Treatise on the Law of Bankruptcy Vol 1 , pp 52 - 53 note ; Commentaries on the Law of Scotland -LRB- 7th edition -RRB- Vol 1 , p 308 note 3 , at pp 308 - 309 : `` It was observed from the bench , upon the above case of Smith and Taylor being quoted as a precedent , that the court ought entirely to disapprove of the decision , and of the principles on which it proceeded ; and in this opinion the whole court concurred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	995	The notion , it was observed , of the estate of a bankrupt going tantum et tale , as it existed in his person , into the hands of the trustee is erroneous , when it is pleaded to exclude a competition between the trustee and creditors who have obtained a disposition only from the bankrupt , without having as yet completed it by sasine . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope, lord rodger
104	996	While the deliverance upon the petition of sequestration is no bar , on the one hand , to such a creditor from going on to complete his right , yet if , on the other , he neglects so to do till after the trustee has vested the property in himself by a complete feudal title , the subject must unquestionably be carried to the creditors at large ; and the imperfect right of the earlier claimant superseded .

104	998	In Wylie v Duncan -LRB- 1803 -RRB- M 10269 ; 3 Ross 's LC 134 Wylie sold certain tenements to Archibald who took infeftment on the disposition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	999	On the same day as he received the disposition Archibald granted a letter to Wylie binding himself to resell the tenements to Wylie on six months ' notice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1000	The following year Archibald was sequestrated and the trustee , who was infeft , sold the tenements . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1001	Wylie then produced the letter and insisted that the original transaction had been intended as a security for a loan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1002	He therefore claimed to be entitled to redeem the tenements on payment of the sum borrowed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1003	He brought proceedings against the trustee before the Glasgow magistrates who assoilzied the trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1004	Archibald appealed to the Court of Session , arguing that the trustee must take the debtor 's property tantum et tale , subject to the right of redemption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1005	The Lord Ordinary found in favour of Archibald but the court allowed the trustee 's reclaiming motion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1006	Lord President Campbell observed inter alia , 3 Ross 's LC 134 , 136 - 137 : `` Tantum et tale has often been pleaded against adjudgers ; and if good against them , would be so against trustees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1007	But the law for some time has held otherwise ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1008	Tantum et tale is good as to objections , which go to the extinction of the subject adjudged ; eg if heritable bond adjudged , extinction is a good answer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1009	If right qualified gremio , that is also a good answer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1010	But if not , as here , and not going to extinction , it is a mere personal matter , which touches not the adjudger more than a lender on heritable bond ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1011	As to an adjudger , if there is any doubt , let us solemnly hear the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1012	But I hold that there is none . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1013	He takes on the faith of the record , not tantum et tale . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1014	130 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1015	Precisely for the kinds of reasons that Lord Hoffmann has highlighted , the status of trusts which did not appear on the register continued to be debated . 	lord rodger	lord hoffmann	partagr	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1016	That question was not settled until the decision of the House in Heritable Reversionary Co Ltd v Millar -LRB- 1892 -RRB- 19 R -LRB- HL -RRB- 43 , 48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1017	For the rest , however , the tract of decisions just discussed appears to have gone a long way to settling that adjudgers and , hence , trustees in bankruptcy - just like bona fide purchasers - took the subjects free of any personal obligation on the part of the debtor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1018	Certainly , even by 1800 , in his Treatise on Bankruptcy Vol 1 , p 52 Bell felt able to state what he regarded as the settled doctrine in this way : `` Thus , where a person sells a subject , and , before the purchaser 's right is completed , sells it a second time , he is guilty of a crime known in Scotland by the name of Stellionate ; but although the vendor be liable to punishment , the right of the second purchaser , if first completed , is not affected by the vendor 's fraudulent disappointment of the first . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1019	And if the general creditors of the seller be substituted in the room of such second purchaser , and they be supposed to have completed their diligence before the real right of the first purchaser is completed , they will be liable to no exception on account of the debtor 's fraud more than the individual purchaser would have been . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1020	The passage appears in very much the same form in Bell 's Commentaries on the Law of Scotland -LRB- 7th edition -RRB- Vol 1 , p 308 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1021	In a later passage of the Treatise , at p 82 , Bell repeats the point : `` It is a corollary from this general rule , that the right first completed by sasine , whether it be voluntary or judicial , carries the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1022	The purchaser of a feudal subject may have paid the price , and yet a creditor of the seller , or the trustee for the whole body of creditors , adjudging , or receiving a voluntary conveyance from the bankrupt -LRB- provided it is not objectionable on the bankrupt statutes -RRB- and taking the first infeftment , acquires a preference , leaving the purchaser to claim as a personal creditor merely . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1023	131 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1024	The decisions in Buchan v Farquharson and Wylie v Duncan , in particular , and these observations by Bell show that , for the last 200 years , in terms of the bankruptcy legislation , heritable property which the debtor has sold and disponed but on which the purchaser is not infeft has been regarded as forming part of the debtor 's estate that vests in the trustee in sequestration by adjudication or , originally , by voluntary conveyance from the debtor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1025	Indeed , so far from there ever being any doubt about the bankruptcy statutes applying so as to vest such rights in the trustee , the actual live issue in the early days was whether the deliverance on the sequestration constituted a mid-impediment preventing a purchaser or a creditor under a heritable bond from taking sasine after the date of sequestration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1026	The point was settled in favour of the creditor and purchaser in Cormack v Anderson -LRB- 1829 -RRB- 7 S 868 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1027	This meant that purchasers and heritable creditors could acquire a preference over the trustee by taking sasine and duly recording the instrument of sasine before the trustee completed his feudal title . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1028	They were therefore to be regarded as rivals and opponents of the trustee and of the general creditors for whom he acted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1029	The trustee 's right and the right of the purchaser , heritable creditor or assignee were `` simply two independent rights running a race against each other '' : Tod 's Trs v Wilson -LRB- 1869 -RRB- 7 M 1100 , 1103 per Lord Kinloch . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1030	132 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1031	Indeed , once this general point had been established , competitions between uninfeft heritable creditors and purchasers and uninfeft trustees in sequestration were inevitable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1032	A rather special competition of this kind occurred in Inglis v Mansfield -LRB- 1835 -RRB- 1 S & Macl 203 -LRB- HL -RRB- ; sub nom Mansfield v Walker 's Trs -LRB- 1833 -RRB- 11 S 813 -LRB- Court of Session -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1033	In 1823 Josiah Walker , the admirer of Robert Burns and dilettante professor of Humanity at Glasgow University , agreed to lend # 6,000 to James Stuart of Dunearn WS . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1034	Stuart gave Walker a heritable bond which both parties apparently believed covered 95 acres of valuable land . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1035	Walker took infeftment and the instrument of sasine was recorded in 1824 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1036	In 1828 Stuart suddenly went abroad in bankrupt circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1037	He was sequestrated on 1 September of that year and on 6 October Mansfield was confirmed as trustee in the sequestration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1038	In accordance with the procedure at the time , a decree of adjudication was pronounced in favour of the trustee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1039	It was recorded on 18 October . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1040	On looking at the titles the trustee discovered that the security granted by Stuart in 1823 covered only five acres and he therefore proposed to claim the remainder of the land for the benefit of the general creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1041	At the request of agents for Walker and other parties to whom bonds had been granted , however , on 29 May 1829 , from the safety of New York , Stuart granted what was described as `` a bond of corroboration '' , in effect extending the security to cover the whole of the 95 acres , which were fully described . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1042	Stuart also granted a precept on which sasine was taken on behalf of Walker and recorded on 13 July 1829 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1043	Meanwhile , on 19 June , as required under the bankruptcy legislation at the time , Stuart had executed a special disposition in favour of the trustee so as to allow him to complete title to the heritable estate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1044	The trustee was infeft on 12 August 1829 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1045	133 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1046	The trustee then raised proceedings to reduce the bond of corroboration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1047	One ground , which is of no importance for present purposes , related to the Bankruptcy Act 1696 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1048	The other ground was that the bond of corroboration and precept of sasine , which was the only possible basis for Walker being infeft in the 95 acres , had been granted subsequent to the period when Stuart 's estates were specially adjudged and declared to belong to the trustee , `` whereby the said James Stuart was divested thereof , and , consequently , the said disposition and infeftment thereon are null , as being granted a non habente potestatem . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1049	Walker 's defence was that the bond of corroboration had been executed in implement of an agreement that did not fall under the 1696 Act , `` nor did the decreet of adjudication prevent Mr Stuart from granting such a deed , nor Mr Walker from taking infeftment in the lands , seeing that at the time when he did so the trustee had not obtained infeftment . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1050	Walker died in 1831 and the defence of the action was taken over by his trustees , headed up by the Reverend Dr John Inglis , father of the future Lord President . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1051	The Lord Ordinary reported the question to the Inner House and the Second Division consulted the other judges . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1052	There was a division of opinion among the judges of the Court of Session , with both the Lord President and the Lord Justice Clerk favouring Walker 's trustees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1053	But , in accordance with the views of the majority , decree of reduction of the bond of corroboration was pronounced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1054	Walker 's trustees appealed to your Lordships ' House , but the House dismissed the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1055	134 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1056	It is important to notice that it was Walker who was first infeft on the additional lands in July 1829 , by virtue of the bond of corroboration - the trustee in sequestration being infeft in the estate only in August . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1057	Walker 's trustees therefore argued that , at the time when Stuart granted the bond of corroboration , the real right in the lands remained vested in him - and so , when the real right subsequently vested in the trustee , it was subject to the security made real by Walker 's infeftment on the bond . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1058	The argument for the trustee was , in effect , that , irrespective of the strict feudal position , the deed impetrated from Stuart during the bankruptcy proceedings was void . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1059	135 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1060	The argument for Walker 's trustees clearly caused Lord Brougham some anxiety when giving his initial views at the end of the hearing on 8 April 1835 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1061	He indicated , 1 S & Macl 203 , 324 , that his opinion was that section 29 of the bankruptcy statute `` divests the bankrupt , although it does not invest the trustee until his feudal title shall be made up . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1062	So neither the bankrupt nor the trustee could deal with the property - the bankrupt because the estate was vested in the trustee and the trustee because he could not give a feudal title until his investiture was completed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1063	Lord Brougham considered that nothing could be `` more consistent with the principles of statute law , or less consistent with the principles of the common law , than that any fee should remain in pendente , or , as it is sometimes phrased , in nubibus . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1064	When he came to give his considered reasons , four days later , Lord Brougham did not advert to the arguments on this point in detail , but simply affirmed , at pp 336 - 337 , that , by reason of section 29 and other provisions of the bankruptcy statute , the adjudication in favour of the trustee `` divests the bankrupt : although , until the trustee makes up his title , he can not convey by sale or encumbrance upon plain feudal principles , still it is enough to take the property out of the bankrupt ... . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1065	On this basis Lord Brougham held that Stuart had had no power to grant the bond of corroboration once the decree of adjudication in favour of the trustee had been pronounced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1066	136 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1067	The principal argument for Walker 's trustees on this aspect of the case was , however , to the effect that , when Stuart 's heritable estate was adjudged to the trustee for the general creditors under the bankruptcy statute , he took the estate tantum et tale as it stood in Stuart . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1068	Either fraudulently or by culpa lata , Stuart had failed to dispone the 95 acres . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1069	Had he done so , the lands would have been subject to a heritable security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1070	Therefore the trustee could not reduce the bond of corroboration which was simply designed to do what Stuart should have done in 1823 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1071	This argument traversed many familiar features of the landscape , Mitchells v Ferguson , Smith v Taylor , Buchan v Farquharson , Russell v Ross 's Creditors and Wylie v Duncan : 1 S & M ' L 203 , 316 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1072	In particular , the appellants reverted to the theme that adjudgers were people who had relied on the personal credit of the debtor rather than on the state of his heritable title in the register . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1073	So there was no reason why they should be entitled to ignore personal obligations of the debtor simply because they had not entered the register : 1 S & M ' L 203 , 297 - 300 , 314 - 316 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1074	The respondent argued that the tantum et tale doctrine went no further than to affect creditors and adjudgers where the debtor had originally acquired the property in question by fraud . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1075	It did not apply where , as in that case , the debtor had acquired an unqualified title but , in the enjoyment of that unqualified right , he had come under an obligation , express or implied , to convey the right to another : 1 S & M ' L 203 , 313 - 316 , referring to the same tract of authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1076	137 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1077	In his initial decision , at pp 326 - 327 , Lord Brougham acquitted Stuart of any blame , far less of any fraud or culpa lata , in the original transaction in 1823 - thereby cutting away the basis of the appellants ' argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1078	Accordingly , in his final decision Lord Brougham did not deal with it in any detail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1079	He simply distinguished the English law relating to equitable interests and said , at pp 338 - 339 : `` Upon feudal principles , the party who first perfects his title by sasine -LRB- and since the act 1617 , by registration also of his sasine -RRB- is preferred to him , who , at a prior time , may have paid his money on an agreement or obligation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1080	Land is only affected by the Scotch and the feudal law in a certain way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1081	Any other mode of conveying it , or burthening it , is as inept and as inefficient as a sale or mortgage by parole would be with us . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1082	If , here , a man gave his money on a parole conveyance or mortgage , he would of course be cut out by one who the next month got a mortgage or conveyance , or even an equitable title , by a written agreement , from the same proprietor to the same lands . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1083	This might be a hardship , and it is exactly the same kind of hardship which may happen in Scotland and which has happened here , with this only difference , that in Scotland writing may be as inefficient to affect the land as parole is here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1084	This consideration , too , is an answer to the argument , that the trustee takes the estate of the bankrupt tantum et tale . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1085	He does so ; and the estate was not affected in the bankrupt 's hands by the personal obligations , which were sufficiently valid and binding against the bankrupt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1086	Between the bankrupt and the trustee there can be no privity such as to affect the latter with any personal obligation incurred by the former ; and the land not being affected by such obligations , the trustee taking it tantum et tale takes it discharged of any real burthen . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1087	In other words Lord Brougham held that , since the debtor and the trustee in sequestration are different persons , the trustee is not affected by any personal obligations that may have affected the debtor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1088	On the other hand the trustee does take the heritable estate subject to the obligations that affected the estate in the debtor 's hands . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1089	But , since purely personal obligations do not affect the heritable estate as such , the real right that the trustee takes is not subject to any burden . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1090	It followed that when Stuart 's estate had vested in the hands of the trustee it had been unaffected by any possible obligation of Stuart to Walker to grant a heritable security over the remainder of the 95 acres . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1091	Impliedly , at least , Lord Brougham rejected the more detailed argument for the appellants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1092	138 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1093	In Heritable Reversionary Co Ltd v Millar -LRB- 1892 -RRB- 19 R -LRB- HL -RRB- 43 , 48 Lord Watson was careful to distinguish and not to cast doubt on the decision in Walker 's Trs v Stuart 's Tr or in any of the earlier cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1094	Indeed he expressly said , at p 48 , that he had no doubt that the doctrine of tantum et tale had no application in the circumstances of Russell v Ross 's Creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1095	He then went on to point out that in that case and in Mitchells v Ferguson , Wylie v Duncan and Mansfield v Walker 's Trs the application of the tantum et tale doctrine had been rejected where the creditor was in competition `` with others who had prior but merely personal rights to demand a conveyance from him -LSB- sc the debtor -RSB- . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1096	There is therefore nothing in Lord Watson 's reasoning that affects the clear line of authority which governs this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1097	Similarly , in Coloquhouns ' Tr v Campbell 's Trs -LRB- 1902 -RRB- 4 F 739 , 743 - 744 Lord Kinnear regarded Mansfield v Walker as a correct statement of the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger

104	1099	In his Commentaries on the recent statutes relative to ... sequestration in mercantile bankruptcy -LRB- 1840 -RRB- , p 168 , in Observation 2 on section 25 of the Bankruptcy -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1839 , Bell said that its effect with regard to such heritable property as requires sasine : `` is to make the trustee run a race of diligence for the obtaining of sasine with creditors holding an inchoated security ; the first completed right being preferable . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1100	Bell 's view is particularly authoritative since he had been the principal architect of the 1839 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1101	In his Digest of the Bankruptcy -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1856 -LRB- 1856 -RRB- , p 151 note at p 153 Alexander records that this view `` does not appear to have been ever challenged . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1102	140 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1103	In Lord Melville v Paterson -LRB- 1842 -RRB- 4 D 1311 a question arose about the application of the vesting provisions of the 1839 Act in a case where the debtor had died . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1104	Citing Bell in support , the Lord Ordinary -LRB- Ivory -RRB- , whose decision was affirmed by the Second Division , referred to the position in the sequestration of a living debtor in this way , at p 1315 : `` No doubt , the right thus declared to be vested in the trustee , will be no more than a right tantum et tale with what actually belonged to the bankrupt at the date of sequestration ; and where the bankrupt , therefore , has previously granted a prior personal right , in the shape of a conveyance or security , to an individual creditor or other third party , upon which it would be in the power of such a party to run a race against the trustee , it may be necessary for the latter , with a view to exclude the completion of this inchoate adverse right , to obtain his own title first completed according to all the feudal forms , and so entered upon the records . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1105	The same idea of a race for the first registration between the uninfeft purchaser from the debtor and the uninfeft trustee in his sequestration is found , for example , in J Burns , `` English and Scottish Bankruptcies '' -LRB- 1913 -RRB- 29 LQR 460 , 463 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1106	Contrary to what Lord Maclean supposed , 2002 SLT 699 , 707C , in the present case the parties were taking part in just such a race . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1107	141 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1108	For modern readers at least , the image of a race tends to conjure up a sporting contest played according to rules - in which , to use Lord Justice Clerk Thomson 's slightly mixed metaphor , offside goals are not allowed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1109	Nothing could be more misleading . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1110	In Scots law the competition between the trustee and the uninfeft purchaser or creditor with an unrecorded heritable security is a struggle in deadly earnest with the aim of destroying the other competitor 's chance to obtain the real right by recording the relevant deed and infefting himself first .

104	1111	Those taking part in this race are no Corinthians and swear no Olympic oath of sportsmanship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger

104	1115	A purchaser can not knowingly enter such a race with an earlier purchaser . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1116	Rather , if a purchaser becomes aware `` that there may be a prior purchaser in the same queue for Register House he must ask the latter if he be such a purchaser and in the event of a positive , correct answer yield place to him '' : Alex Brewster v Caughey 2002 GWD 15-506 , at para 73 per Lord Eassie . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1117	But Stair , Institutions of the Law of Scotland 1.14.5 draws the critical distinction between purchasers and those , such as adjudging creditors , exercising legal diligence , who are aware that someone has bought the property but is not yet infeft : `` But certain knowledge , by intimation , citation , or the like , inducing malam fidem , whereby any prior disposition or assignation made to another party is certainly known , or at least interruption made in acquiring by arrestment or citation of the acquirer , such rights acquired , not being of necessity to satisfy prior engagements , are reducible ex capite fraudis , and the acquirer is partaker of the fraud of his author , who thereby becomes a granter of double rights ; but this will not hinder legal diligence to proceed and be completed and become effectual , though the user thereof did certainly know any inchoate or incomplete right of another . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1118	Any right that the purchaser acquires when he knows of the previous sale is reducible on the ground that he is participating in the seller 's fraud . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1119	But knowledge of a previous sale does not prevent a creditor from completing his diligence and acquiring a real right : he is entitled to proceed on the basis of the feudal right of the debtor to heritable subjects as recorded in the register and to disregard any personal right relating to those subjects . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1120	That principle underlies the decisions in Douglas v Adjudging Creditors of Kelhead -LRB- 1765 -RRB- 3 Ross 's LC 169 and Mitchells v Ferguson -LRB- 1781 -RRB- M 10296 ; Hailes 879 ; 3 Ross 's LC 120 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1121	Moreover , as the pleadings show , in Mitchells counsel for the adjudgers argued successfully that , if Ferguson had not himself chosen `` to take this step of diligence , or omitted to do it while it was in his power , the fault is his own , and he ought to suffer for his negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1122	But the respondents surely can not be blamed for employing the diligence of the law , in order to recover payment of a just debt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger

104	1124	143 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1125	In Russell v Ross 's Creditors , sub nom Pierse v Ross -LRB- 1792 -RRB- 3 Ross 's LC 177 , 181 Lord Justice Clerk Braxfield made very clear the wholly different standards that the law applies to purchasers as opposed to creditors who are trying to secure their right : `` There is a great distinction between voluntary conveyances and legal diligence of creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1126	When a person takes a voluntary conveyance , the law presumes that he will take care that he will not accept of a conveyance but from a person having a good right , and the fair presumption is , that to be satisfied of this he has searched the records , and among others the Register of Tailzies , and if he there find an entail on record , though no infeftment upon it , he would be in mala fide to accept of a conveyance from the heir of entail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1127	But where a creditor has lent money , he is in law and in justice entitled to take every lawful means to secure his payment , and therefore though a creditor should discover that his debtor was heir in an entail that had been recorded , but upon which infeftment had not been taken , the creditor is in bona fide to disregard this personal deed of entail , and proceed to attach his debtor 's estate by means of a charge to enter heir to his predecessor , and to adjudge , and by doing so he will take the estate free from the fetters of a personal deed of entail . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1128	Referring to this case , in his observations on Calder v Stewart -LRB- 1806 -RRB- Hume 440 , 443 , Baron Hume speaks of the creditor affecting his debtor 's lands with diligence `` in contempt of the tailzie '' for payment of his debts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger

104	1130	In Mansfield v Walker 's Trs -LRB- 1833 -RRB- 11 S 813 , 828 , under reference to Duke of Norfolk v Annuitants of the York Buildings Co -LRB- 1752 -RRB- M 7062 , Lord Craigie observed : `` It is a rule established with us , beyond all memory , that there are no equities in competitions among creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1131	This principle was adopted , and carried to its fullest extent , in the case of the Duke of Norfolk in 1752 ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1132	It has been held , that vigilantibus non dormientibus jura subveniunt ; and although no one ought to become locupletior aliena jactura , yet in damno vitando , every one is entitled to avail himself of the blunders of those whose interests are opposed to his . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1133	However clear and honest the intentions of parties may have been , yet , if the writings used are liable to objection in point of form or solemnity , and still more , if , as in this case , they are defective in the substantial parts , they are in a competition held as inoperative and null ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1134	So , after a competition has begun , a party conscious of a defect in his own right may , by any lawful means , but always without the aid of the bankrupt , direct or indirect , correct the defect pendente lite , so as to be preferred to his adversary , although formerly in a better situation than himself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1135	On looking into the books of authority and the decisions of the court , to be found under the titles of Competition , Execution and Writ , it will be seen that the most minute and critical objections , in point of external formality , or arising from the want of proper and technical words in the instrument , have been sustained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1136	In such circumstances , and notwithstanding the most satisfactory evidence of intention to give a right , the existence of another deed , followed with infeftment , before the former one has been completed , must create an undoubted preference . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1137	These observations are not disputed in the general case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1138	It is the first regular infeftment in real estate - the first act of delivery in the transfer of moveables - and the assignation or conveyance first intimated in personal rights , that is preferred ; although before any of these forms have been gone through , an obligation to dispone , or to make delivery , or to give a valid assignation , can be shown . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1139	Particularly in recorded real rights , if appearing in the appropriate register , unless fraud can be proved , the entry in the record is the only evidence that can be depended upon ; without this a form calculated to give security to creditors and purchasers would become a snare to them . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1140	Having mentioned more recent cases where there had been an attempt to question the position in the case of adjudications of lands , Lord Craigie referred to earlier cases and continued , at p 829 : `` Thus , in the case of base rights prior to the establishment of the registers for publication , a later conveyance or adjudication , if followed by possession , was preferred to the former ones , although clearly importing an obligation to make an effectual transmission of the right ; and so , in the case of personal rights of lands , he who obtains the first infeftment will be preferred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1141	In the these cases , although before possession has followed in the one case , or infeftment in the other , the party so situated may have become acquainted with the conveyance prior in date , still he will be preferred ; and it would be singular if the result were different . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1142	Lord Balgray , at p 831 , referred to the mistake made by Stuart in conveying only five instead of 95 acres of land and said that this no doubt created an obligation on him to apply the proper correction '' - but this extends no further than the parties immediately concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1143	Creditors certainly can not benefit themselves by fraud , but being certantes de damno vitando they have been always considered to be entitled to take advantage of errors and mistakes , to the effect of obtaining a fair and equal distribution of their debtor 's effects . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1144	Similarly , in Earl of Fife v Duff -LRB- 1862 -RRB- 24 D 936 , 942 the Whole Court were careful to say that the personal fee was of no effect `` against third parties who may attach the estate by legal execution for the debts of the disponer , or who may in bona fide purchase it from him , and be first infeft .

104	1147	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1148	in the present case the respondent has done nothing more than take advantage of the mistake or error of his rivals , the appellants , in failing to get off their mark and record the disposition from Mrs Burnett promptly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1149	Even once their agents had become aware that her estate had been sequestrated and that the respondent had been appointed as permanent trustee , for whatever reason , they failed to act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1150	In retrospect at least , that was a mistake , since it allowed the respondent to record his notice of title before the appellants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1151	As the authorities show , even although the respondent was well aware that the appellants held a disposition from Mrs Burnett , he was fully entitled to take advantage of their mistake by recording the notice of title and so completing the diligence by acquiring the real right in the subjects for the creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1152	At times during his submissions Mr Hodge appeared somewhat apologetic about what the respondent had done : conspicuously , he was unable to say whether the respondent had recorded the notice of title with the deliberate purpose of defeating the appellants ' rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1153	I have little doubt , however , that this is exactly what he did , since there appears to be no other good reason for taking the step . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1154	After all , he did not need to do so in order to grant a disposition to a purchaser since he could have deduced title from Mrs Burnett . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1155	Moreover , in his pleadings the respondent avers that he sought the advice of his law agents on or about 25 November - not long before he recorded the notice of title . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1156	In reality , when he recorded his notice of title at the expense of the appellants , the respondent acted in the spirit of the established law by exploiting their failure to record the disposition in their favour . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1157	He did nothing more than his duty on behalf of the creditors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1158	To have done less for them would have been questionable , to say the least . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1159	Therefore , in this case the law of bankruptcy worked as it has been intended to work for at least 200 years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1160	Whether that law is - in the words of Lord Macnaghten in Heritable Reversionary Company Ltd v Millar -LRB- 1892 -RRB- 19 R -LRB- HL -RRB- 43 , 52 - `` in a condition altogether satisfactory '' obviously involves fundamental issues of legal policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1161	But they are of a kind that must be left to the legislature . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1162	Your Lordships have to apply the existing law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1163	146 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1164	In the result , Mrs Burnett 's right to the flat vested in the respondent as part of her `` whole estate '' under section 31 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1985 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1165	Since the respondent then recorded his notice of title and became infeft in October 1991 , by reason of the Real Rights Act 1693 his infeftment is to be preferred to the infeftment of the appellants who recorded their disposition in January 1992 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1166	The respondent is therefore entitled to declarator in terms of the second crave in the initial writ . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1167	147 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1168	Finally , I should wish to reserve my opinion on a point that was not fully explored at the hearing of the appeal : whether , when the uninfeft proprietor 's rights are destroyed by the trustee recording a notice of title , the uninfeft proprietor can rank as an unsecured creditor in the sequestration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1169	Mr Hodge asserted that he could , and there is support for that view in a comment of Bell , Treatise on the Law of Bankruptcy Vol 1 , p 82 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1170	I remain unclear , however , as to the exact basis of such a claim - which arises only after the date of sequestration - in warrandice or otherwise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hope, lord rodger
104	1171	It follows that I would also reserve my opinion on the , not unrelated , point about unjust enrichment which Lord Hoffmann has mentioned but which was not argued in the appeal . 	lord rodger	lord hoffmann	partagr	1	lord hope, lord rodger

104	1173	For these reasons , in view of the change of circumstances since the interlocutor of the Extra Division , I would recall their interlocutor and the order of the sheriff insofar as he granted decree in terms of the first and third craves of the initial writ , but I would affirm his order granting decree of declarator in terms of the second crave . 	lord rodger	self	outcome	1	lord hope, lord rodger
