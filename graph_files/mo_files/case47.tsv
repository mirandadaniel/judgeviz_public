47	1	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
47	2	LORD NICHOLLS OF BIRKENHEAD 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
47	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
47	4	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
47	5	These two appeals relate to care proceedings under the Children Act 1989 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
47	6	They relate to a type of case which , regrettably , occurs all too frequently . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
47	7	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
47	8	The context is the ` uncertain perpetrator ' type of case , where a child suffers physical harm at the hands of his parents but the court is unable to identify which parent was the perpetrator or , indeed , whether both were perpetrators . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
47	9	The threshold criteria are met . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
47	10	The court so decides at a preliminary ` fact finding ' hearing , and the case then proceeds to the ` welfare ' stage and a ` disposal ' hearing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
47	11	In one of the two appeals before your Lordships ' House Thorpe LJ expressed himself to the effect that at the disposal hearing in such a case the judge can not disregard the risk the mother presents as a primary carer for the child in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
47	12	In the other appeal Ward LJ said the case should proceed on the basis that the child was not harmed by the mother and that there is no risk of the child suffering physical harm from her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
47	13	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
47	14	These appeals arise from this difference in approach of two lords justices , both highly experienced in this field . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
47	15	Disposal hearings have yet to take place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
47	16	The appeals concern the basis on which these hearings should be conducted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	17	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	18	I must first rehearse the facts of the two cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	19	I shall do so in very summary form , since the detail is not material for the purpose of these appeals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	20	The appeals raise a point of principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	21	Child Y 5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	22	In December 2000 child K , just over a year old , was admitted to hospital and pronounced dead on arrival . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	23	He had sustained an appalling catalogue of serious external and internal non-accidental injuries , inflicted on at least four occasions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	24	The local authority commenced care proceedings in respect of child Y , child K 's elder sister . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	25	Child Y , then six years old , was eventually placed with her grandmother . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	26	Child Y has daily contact with her mother , supervised by the family . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	27	The mother 's partner KR left the mother 's home in December 2001 , and the relationship between them appears to have ended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	28	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	29	The case proceeded as a ` split ' hearing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	30	At the preliminary hearing Coleridge J found that KR was the perpetrator of all the injuries , that the mother could be exonerated as a perpetrator and that she had not failed to protect child K at any stage of his life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	31	The Court of Appeal , comprising Thorpe , Rix and Arden LJJ , allowed an appeal by the local authority : see re B -LRB- Non-accidental injury : compelling medical evidence -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- EWCA Civ 902 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 FLR 599 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	32	The court held that KR was a perpetrator , but there was insufficient evidence he was the sole perpetrator . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	33	Thorpe LJ said that following the filing of the position statements there were really only two questions regarding child K 's death . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	34	He said , at -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 FLR 599 , 607 : `` First , who perpetrated the injuries recorded by the experts ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	35	The answer to that can only be , ` either the mother or KR ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	36	The court is unable to determine to the requisite standard which . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	37	Secondly , who failed to protect K from these injuries ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	38	Again , there can be no doubt that the mother failed to protect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	39	KR is not involved in any way in the disposal proceedings which will follow . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	40	He is the more probable perpetrator in relation to most of these injuries . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	41	But the important factor that the judge must bring into the foundation for the disposal hearing is that he can not disregard the risk that the mother presents as a primary carer for either Y or a future child '' ' -LRB- Emphasis added -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	42	After further observations Thorpe LJ concluded : `` So the judge when he comes to the disposal hearing will obviously have to consider anxiously the obvious attraction of rehabilitation against the question mark which certainly attaches to the mother , at least during that period when she was in cohabitation with KR . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	43	Child L and child C 7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	44	In the other case , in May 2001 child L , then aged six months , was found to be suffering from a fractured skull and several other fractures . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	45	The injuries could only have occurred whilst the child was in the care of her parents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	46	The parents separated after child L was admitted to hospital . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
47	47	The father pleaded guilty to charges of causing grievous bodily harm and was sentenced to concurrent sentences of 3 1/2 years and 2 years imprisonment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	48	The father subsequently retracted his admission of responsibility for any injury other than the fracture to the skull . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	49	Child C , born in October 2001 , is the second child of the mother and father . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	50	The local authority commenced care proceedings in respect of both children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	51	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	52	At a preliminary hearing in April 2002 Her Honour the late Judge Downey found that the injuries were non-accidental , that the father was responsible for the fracture to the skull , that no reliance could be placed on his plea of guilty to the criminal charge relating to the other injuries , that neither parent gave any explanation to account for the other injuries , that neither parent could be exculpated as a possible perpetrator , that the injuries were caused by either or both parents whilst the child was in their care , and that the parents individually or jointly failed to protect the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	53	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	54	An appeal by the mother to the Court of Appeal , comprising Ward LJ and Sir Martin Nourse , succeeded in part : see re O and N -LRB- Care : preliminary hearing -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- EWCA Civ 1271 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 FLR 1167 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	55	The court did not disturb any of the judge 's findings , but in the course of his judgment Ward LJ said , at -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 FLR 1167 , 1178 , paragraph 26 : `` In my judgment this case must proceed henceforth upon the clear basis and understanding by all concerned , lawyers , social workers and experts , that L was not harmed by her mother and there is no risk that either L or C is at risk of suffering physical harm from her '' ' -LRB- Emphasis added -RRB- The court varied the form of the judge 's directions order by adding an opening paragraph which included the following : '' -LRB- e -RRB- It is not established upon a balance of probabilities that any one or more of these further injuries were caused by either the -LSB- mother -RSB- or -LSB- father -RSB- -LRB- f -RRB- Accordingly the -LSB- mother -RSB- must be treated as if she did not cause L to suffer significant harm within the meaning of s 31 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	56	Moreover she is to be treated as if she has not caused L to suffer any physical harm or caused L or C to be at risk of suffering physical harm from her within the meaning of s 1 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- e -RRB- of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	57	-LRB- g -RRB- The -LSB- mother -RSB- has caused L harm by failing to protect her from injury by the -LSB- father -RSB- . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	58	-LRB- Emphasis added -RRB- Past events and future forecasts 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	59	Before turning to the provisions of the Children Act 1989 I should make an introductory observation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	60	Courts and tribunals constantly have to decide whether an alleged event occurred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	61	The general rule is that if the likelihood that a past event occurred is proved to the requisite standard the law regards that event as definitely having happened . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	62	If not , it is treated as not having happened . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	63	In deciding whether proof to the requisite standard has been made out , the decision maker normally has regard to all evidential material which is of probative value . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	64	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	65	But the general rule does not always apply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	66	Questions of proof of a past event arise in widely varying contexts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	67	Sometimes the law limits the matters the decision maker may take into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	68	When this occurs , the reason is legal policy , not the requirements of logic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	69	There may , for instance , be a particular category of matters the decision maker is not permitted to consider . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	70	The most obvious example concerns criminal trials . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	71	In general , evidence of previous misconduct is not admissible in criminal trials . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	72	Although such evidence may have probative value , in general it is excluded from consideration by juries because its probative value is outweighed by the risk of prejudice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	73	This exclusionary rule is subject to exceptions in certain types of cases , where the accused should not be permitted to present himself as a person of good character or where the previous misconduct has particular probative value , for instance , as ` similar fact ' evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	74	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	75	The same broad principle is applicable when courts or tribunals peer into the future and assess the likelihood that a particular event will occur . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	76	This is an inherently imprecise exercise , so far as human conduct is concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	77	In theory it is a different exercise from deciding whether somebody did or did not do something in the past . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
47	78	Whether or not an alleged event occurred in the past raises a question of proof . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	79	In truth , the event either happened or not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	80	That is not so with a future forecast . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	81	The future has not happened , and future human conduct is never certain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	82	But in practice , the past is often as uncertain as the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	83	The judge can not know for certain what happened and can only assess the degree of likelihood that something happened . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	84	The same is true of the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	85	The decision maker has to assess the degree of likelihood that an inherently uncertain event will occur . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	86	The degree of likelihood -- beyond reasonable doubt , more probable than not , real possibility and so on -- required in any particular legal context raises a question of legal policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	87	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	88	Here again , the policy decision on the requisite degree of likelihood is a separate question from the policy decision on the matters the court or tribunal may take into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	89	As to the latter , the matters a decision maker may take into account are normally bounded only by the need for them to be relevant , that is , they must be such that , to greater or lesser extent , they will assist the decision maker in reaching a rational conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	90	The context may , indeed , require that this principle should apply in its full width : see , in the context of asylum cases and the difficulties of proof which beset asylum seekers , Karanakaran v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 3 All ER 449 , especially Brooke LJ at 458-470 , and Sedley LJ at 477-479 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	91	The legal context may permit , or require , the decision maker to take into account a real possibility that a past event occurred , or even a mere possibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	92	Rationality does not require that only past events established on a balance of probabilities can be taken into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	93	Or the context may require otherwise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	94	The range of matters the decision maker may take into account when carrying out this exercise depends upon the context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	95	This , again , is a question of legal policy , not logic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	96	The threshold stage : the ` significant harm ' condition 14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	97	Section 31 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Children Act 1989 sets out two ` threshold ' conditions which must be satisfied before the court may exercise its power under section 31 -LRB- 1 -RRB- to make a care or supervision order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	98	The purpose of this threshold requirement is to protect families , both adults and children , from inappropriate interference in their lives by public authorities through the making of care and supervision orders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	99	Section 31 -LRB- 2 -RRB- provides : '' -LRB- 2 -RRB- A court may only make a care or supervision order if it is satisfied - -LRB- a -RRB- that the child concerned is suffering , or is likely to suffer , significant harm ; and -LRB- b -RRB- that the harm , or likelihood of harm , is attributable to - -LRB- i -RRB- the care given to the child , or likely to be given to him if the order were not made , not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give to him ; or -LRB- ii -RRB- the child 's being beyond parental control . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	100	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	101	The first limb of condition -LRB- a -RRB- , the ` significant harm ' condition , concerns an existing state of fact : the child ` is suffering ' significant harm . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	102	In the nature of things this calls for proof , to the requisite standard , of the facts said to constitute significant harm . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	103	An unproved allegation that the child has been sexually abused or subjected to non-accidental injuries will not suffice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	104	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	105	The second limb of condition -LRB- a -RRB- requires the court to evaluate the chance that an event will occur in the future : the child ` is likely to suffer ' significant harm . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	106	In re H -LRB- minors -RRB- -LRB- Sexual abuse : standard of proof -RRB- -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 563 the House considered the matters which , in this context , the court may take into account in assessing whether the child is likely to suffer significant harm . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	107	In the context of section 31 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- ` likely ' does not mean more probable than not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
47	108	It means a real possibility , a possibility that can not sensibly be ignored having regard to the nature and gravity of the feared harm in the particular case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	109	This is a comparatively low level of risk . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	110	By a majority the House held that , for the purpose of satisfying this threshold level of risk in cases -LRB- such as alleged sexual abuse -RRB- in which there is a dispute over whether the child has indeed suffered past harm , the court may have regard only to harm proved to the requisite standard to have happened . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	111	Otherwise the purpose for which the threshold criteria were prescribed by Parliament could be defeated in a case where the only evidence that the child was likely to suffer harm in the future was an unproved allegation that he had suffered harm in the past . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	112	It would be extraordinary if , in respect of the self-same non-proven allegations , the self-same insufficient evidence could nonetheless be regarded as a sufficient factual basis for satisfying the court there is a real possibility of harm in the future : see -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 563 , 591 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	113	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	114	This would not be an acceptable interpretation of section 31 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	115	This suggests that , given the purpose of the threshold criteria , both limbs of the ` significant harm ' condition call for proof of facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	116	Like the inference that the child is already suffering harm , the inference that the child is likely to suffer significant harm must be founded on one or more proved facts , as distinct from unproved allegations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	117	Therein lies the protection Parliament intends the threshold criteria shall provide against arbitrary intervention by public authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	118	This is the principal rationale for what might otherwise seem an unduly rigid approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	119	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	120	The same considerations do not apply throughout the whole of the Children Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	121	The particular reason why the threshold conditions require proof of facts is not germane in every instance where a decision has to be made regarding the existence or extent of risk of future harm to a child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	122	In the case of each statutory provision it is necessary to consider the language and purpose of the provision to see whether , for reasons of legal policy , any limitation should be placed on the matters the decision maker may take into account when assessing the risk in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	123	An example of this concerns the duties of investigation placed upon local authorities by section 47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	124	As Scott Baker J held in re S -LRB- Sexual abuse allegations : local authority response -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- EWHC Admin 334 , -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 2 FLR 776 , local authorities would be prevented from carrying out effective and timely risk assessments if they could act only on the basis of proven facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	125	The threshold criteria : the ` attributable ' condition 19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	126	In Lancashire County Council v B -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 2 AC 147 the House considered how threshold condition -LRB- b -RRB- , the ` attributable ' condition , should be applied in cases such as the present two appeals , where the significant harm condition is satisfied but the court is unable to decide which of two or more carers was the perpetrator of the physical harm in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	127	The House decided that in such ` uncertain perpetrator ' cases the phrase ` the care given to the child ' in section 31 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- -LRB- i -RRB- includes the care given by any of the carers , so that this condition is fulfilled even though the identity of the particular carer who was the perpetrator is not known . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	128	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	129	Section 31 and its associated emergency and interim provisions comprise the only court mechanism available to a local authority to protect a child from risk . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	130	The interpretation of the ` attributable ' condition adopted by the House is necessary to avoid the unacceptable consequence that , otherwise , if the court can not identify which of the child 's carers was responsible for inflicting the injuries the child will remain wholly unprotected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	131	As Wall J observed in re B -LRB- minors -RRB- -LRB- Care proceedings : practice -RRB- -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 1 WLR 238 , 248 , that would render the statutory provisions ineffective to deal with a commonplace aspect of child protection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	132	The interpretation adopted by the House avoids this result while , at the same time , encroaching to the minimum extent necessary on the general principle underpinning section 31 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	133	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	134	In reaching this conclusion on the interpretation of the legislation your Lordships ' House had very much in mind that , in consequence , judges will find themselves faced with the particularly difficult problem of proceeding with the care application but not knowing which individual was responsible for inflicting the injuries . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	135	And parents who may be wholly innocent , and whose care may not have fallen below that of a reasonable parent , will face the possibility of losing their child : see -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 2 AC 147 , 166-167 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	136	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	137	The House now has to consider some of the practical implications of this decision at the welfare stage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	138	The welfare stage 23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
47	139	Crossing the threshold is not a reason for making a care order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	140	When the threshold criteria are met the court proceeds to the welfare stage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	141	The court must decide whether it is in the best interests of the child to make a care order as asked by the local authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	142	As with ` private law ' orders made under section 8 of the Act , so with care and supervision orders made under section 31 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , the paramount consideration in making this decision is the child 's welfare : section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	143	This involves looking at the past and also looking into the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	144	In considering which course is in the child 's best interests , the court will have regard to all the circumstances of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	145	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	146	This has long been axiomatic in this area of the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	147	The matters the court may take into account are bounded only by the need for them to be relevant , that is , they must be such that , to a greater or lesser extent , they will assist the court in deciding which course is in the child 's best interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	148	I can see no reason of legal policy why , in principle , any other limitation should be placed on the matters the judge may take into account when making this decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	149	If authority is needed for this conclusion I need refer only to the wide , all embracing language of Lord MacDermott in J v C -LSB- 1970 -RSB- AC 668 , 710-711 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	150	Section 1 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1925 required the court , in proceedings where the upbringing of an infant was in question , to regard the welfare of the infant ` as the first and paramount consideration ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	151	Regarding these words , Lord MacDermott said : `` I think they connote a process whereby , when all the relevant facts , relationships , claims and wishes of parents , risks , choices and other circumstances are taken into account and weighed , the course to be followed will be that which is most in the interests of the child 's welfare as that term has now to be understood . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	152	In principle the same approach is equally applicable under section 1 of the Children Act 1989 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	153	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	154	The Children Act directs the court , when making a decision regarding a child 's welfare , to have particular regard to the factors set out in the welfare checklist in section 1 -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	155	One of these factors is any harm the child ` has suffered or is at risk of suffering ' : section 1 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- e -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	156	Questions have arisen on the interaction of this paragraph and section 31 -LRB- 2 -RRB- as interpreted in re H -LRB- minors -RRB- -LRB- Sexual abuse : standard of proof -RRB- -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 563 and Lancashire County Council v B -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 2 AC 147 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	157	The questions have arisen in three areas . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	158	The welfare stage : ` uncertain perpetrator ' cases 26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	159	The first area concerns cases of the type involved in the present appeals , where the judge finds a child has suffered significant physical harm at the hands of his parents but is unable to say which . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	160	I stress one feature of this type of case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	161	These are cases where it has been proved , to the requisite standard of proof , that the child is suffering significant harm or is likely to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	162	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	163	Here , as a matter of legal policy , the position seems to me straightforward . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	164	Quite simply , it would be grotesque if such a case had to proceed at the welfare stage on the footing that , because neither parent , considered individually , has been proved to be the perpetrator , therefore the child is not at risk from either of them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	165	This would be grotesque because it would mean the court would proceed on the footing that neither parent represents a risk even though one or other of them was the perpetrator of the harm in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	166	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	167	That would be a self-defeating interpretation of the legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	168	It would mean that , in ` uncertain perpetrator ' cases , the court decides that the threshold criteria are satisfied but then lacks the ability to proceed in a sensible way in the best interests of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	169	The preferable interpretation of the legislation is that in such cases the court is able to proceed at the welfare stage on the footing that each of the possible perpetrators is , indeed , just that : a possible perpetrator . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
47	170	As Hale LJ said in re G -LRB- Care proceedings : split trials -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 1 FLR 872 , 882 : `` the fact that a judge can not always decide means that when one gets to the later hearing , the later hearing has to proceed on the basis that each is a possible perpetrator . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	171	This approach accords with the basic principle that in considering the requirements of the child 's welfare the court will have regard to all the circumstances of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	172	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	173	In such cases the judge at the preliminary hearing , while unable to identify the perpetrator , may decide that one or other of the parents , perhaps both , was guilty of failure to protect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	174	It was submitted that herein lies a better solution to the problem . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	175	The court should assess future risk on the basis of this proved shortcoming . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	176	This would be a better way to proceed because it would avoid attaching to each parent the stigma of possible perpetrator . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	177	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	178	I do not believe this would be a satisfactory alternative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	179	Inability to identify the perpetrator is not always accompanied by a finding of failure to protect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	180	The judge may find that the child was injured in only one incident , by one or other of the parents , in a momentary loss of self-control . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	181	Further , when assessing future risk , failure to protect is one matter , perpetration is another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	182	A finding of failure to protect is not a reason for leaving out of account at the welfare stage the undoubted fact that one or other of the parents inflicted the physical harm on the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	183	This may be important in cases where circumstances have changed since the injuries were inflicted and the parents are no longer living together . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	184	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	185	In ` uncertain perpetrator ' cases the correct approach must be that the judge conducting the disposal hearing will have regard , to whatever extent is appropriate , to the facts found by the judge at the preliminary hearing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	186	Nowadays the same judge usually conducts both hearings , but this is not always so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	187	When the facts found at the preliminary hearing leave open the possibility that a parent or other carer was a perpetrator of proved harm , it would not be right for that conclusion to be excluded from consideration at the disposal hearing as one of the matters to be taken into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	188	The importance to be attached to that possibility , as to every feature of the case , necessarily depends on the circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	189	But to exclude that possibility altogether from the matters the judge may consider would risk distorting the court 's assessment of where , having regard to all the circumstances , the best interests of the child lie . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	190	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	191	Similarly , and for the same reason , the judge at the disposal hearing will take into account any views expressed by the judge at the preliminary hearing on the likelihood that one carer was or was not the perpetrator , or a perpetrator , of the inflicted injuries . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	192	Depending on the circumstances , these views may be of considerable value in deciding the outcome of the application : for instance , whether the child should be rehabilitated with his mother . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	193	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	194	From what I have said above it follows that I respectfully disagree with the approach adopted by Ward LJ in the case of child L and child C. Judge Downey concluded , expressly , that the evidence was not sufficient to exclude the mother and positively identify the father as the perpetrator of the injuries other than the fractured skull . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	195	In the light of this factual conclusion it would be quite wrong for the case to proceed on the false basis that the mother had been found not to be the perpetrator . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	196	The approach adopted in Re H , followed by Ward LJ in the case of child L and child C , is not apt at the welfare stage in ` uncertain perpetrator ' cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	197	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	198	I wholly understand that parents are apprehensive that , if each of them is labelled a possible perpetrator , social workers and others may all too readily rule out the prospect of rehabilitation with either of them because the child would be ` at risk ' with either of them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	199	As already noted , failure to protect is one thing , perpetration is another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	200	A parent fears that , once the possibility that he or she was a perpetrator is brought into the scales , cautious social workers will let that factor outweigh all others . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
47	201	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	202	I understand this concern . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	203	Whether it is well founded , generally or in particular cases , is an altogether different matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	204	Whether well founded or not , the way ahead can not be for cases to proceed on an artificial footing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	205	Rather , in cases of split hearings judges must be astute to express such views as they can at the preliminary hearing to assist social workers and psychiatrists in making their assessments and preparing the draft care plan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	206	For their part social workers , I do not doubt , will have well in mind the need to consider all the circumstances when assessing the risk posed by a carer who is , but who is no more than , a possible perpetrator . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	207	To this end transcripts of judgments given at the preliminary hearing should always be made readily available when required , so that reliance does not have to be placed on summaries or even bare statements of conclusions : see Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss P in re G -LRB- Care proceedings : split trials -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 1 FLR 872 , 876 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	208	I must mention a further point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	209	The burden of proof on care order applications rests on the local authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	210	But , it was submitted , to proceed as mentioned above would improperly reverse the burden of proof . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	211	The parent would have the onus of exculpating himself when the local authority failed to prove he was a perpetrator but the possibility that he was a perpetrator was left open . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	212	I am unable to accept this submission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	213	It can not stand with the decision in Lancashire County Council v B -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 2 AC 147 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	214	As already noted , the effect of this decision was that a care order may be made in this type of case even though the local authority failed to prove , to the requisite standard of proof , which parent was the perpetrator of the physical harm . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	215	The approach described above does no more than give effect to this decision at the welfare stage in the only sensible way which is possible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	216	On the present appeals , I add , no submission was made that the House should reconsider the decision in Lancashire County Council v B -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 2 AC 147 , nor have I heard anything to suggest the House should do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	217	The welfare stage : unproved allegations of harm 37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	218	The second area where a question has arisen about the interaction of section 1 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- e -RRB- and section 31 -LRB- 2 -RRB- does not directly concern the present appeals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	219	Nevertheless I should comment briefly so that the observations made above are seen in context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	220	This second area relates to the type of case where the threshold criteria are satisfied on one ground , such as neglect or failure to protect , but not on another ground , such as physical harm . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	221	At the welfare stage , to what extent may the court take into account the possibility that the non-proven allegation might , after all , be true ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	222	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	223	This raises a question of legal policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	224	On the one hand there is the family protection purpose of the threshold criteria . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	225	On the other hand there is the general principle that at the welfare stage the court has regard to all the circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	226	On balance , I consider that to have regard at the welfare stage to allegations of harm rejected at the threshold stage would have the effect of depriving the child and the family of the protection intended to be afforded by the threshold criteria . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	227	Accordingly , at the welfare stage in this type of case the court should proceed on the footing that the unproven allegations are no more than that . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	228	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	229	This accords with the approach of the Court of Appeal in re M and R -LRB- Child abuse : evidence -RRB- -LSB- 1996 -RSB- 2 FLR 195 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	230	On an application for a care order the judge found there was a real possibility that sexual abuse had occurred but the evidence was not sufficient to prove the allegations to the requisite standard . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
47	231	The threshold criteria were met on another ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	232	The children had suffered emotional harm at the hands of the mother and her partner and were likely to suffer significant harm in the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	233	The judge made an interim care order and adjourned the case to consider whether to return the children to the mother and her partner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	234	The local authority appealed against the judge 's refusal to make a care order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	235	One ground of appeal was that the judge had erred by not taking the allegations of sexual abuse into account at the welfare stage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	236	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	237	The Court of Appeal , comprising Butler-Sloss , Henry and Saville LJJ , dismissed the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	238	Part of the reasoning of the decision was to the effect that it would be extraordinary if Parliament intended that , in one and the same case , evidence insufficient to satisfy section 31 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- should be sufficient nevertheless to satisfy section 1 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- e -RRB- : see Butler-Sloss LJ at -LSB- 1996 -RSB- 2 FLR 195 , 204 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	239	Butler-Sloss LJ drew attention to the unsatisfactory results which could follow in practice were this so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	240	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	241	I should also note that the position is not materially different when unproved allegations of harm are abandoned , as distinct from being rejected by the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	242	This situation arose in re R -LRB- Care : disclosure : nature of proceedings -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 FLR 755 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	243	The local authority made , but later abandoned , allegations of sexual abuse within the family . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	244	The threshold criteria were satisfied on a different ground , namely , neglect and emotional harm . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	245	Charles J held that as matters stood the local authority and the court should assess risk on the basis that the allegations of sexual abuse were just that and nothing more . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	246	Part of the background , and relevant as such , was that the allegations had been made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	247	Also part of the background , and likewise relevant , was the fact that the allegations had not been proved and , as matters stood , would not be proved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	248	It would be wrong for the local authority to deal with the family on the basis that it believed the children had been sexually abused . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	249	That overall approach , the judge noted , accorded with the current reality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	250	Private law cases and section 1 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- e -RRB- 42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	251	The reasoning of the decision in re M and R -LRB- Child abuse : evidence -RRB- -LSB- 1996 -RSB- 2 FLR 195 raises a further question on the interaction of section 1 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- e -RRB- and section 31 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	252	The question is whether the interpretation of section 31 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- adopted in re H is applicable to section 1 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- e -RRB- in private law proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	253	Butler Sloss LJ considered that it is : see -LSB- 1996 -RSB- 2 FLR 195 , 203 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	254	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	255	The case of re M and R concerned an application for a care order , but the same question arose in private law proceedings in the earlier case of re P -LRB- Sexual abuse : standard of proof -RRB- -LSB- 1996 -RSB- 2 FLR 333 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	256	There the Court of Appeal , comprising Beldam LJ and Wall J , reached a similar conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	257	In that case , unlike ` uncertain perpetrator ' cases , sexual abuse was not proved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	258	In refusing to order unsupervised contact the judge took into account the substantial risk that sexual abuse by the father had occurred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	259	The Court of Appeal allowed the father 's appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	260	Wall J said that the judge committed a ` fundamental error ' in taking this risk into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	261	He noted the undesirable practical consequences flowing from the judge 's approach , at -LSB- 1996 -RSB- 2 FLR 333 , 343 : `` It has also had the effect , in the instant case , of producing the worst of all worlds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
47	262	The father remains under a cloud . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
47	263	Abuse is not proved on the balance of probabilities , but he remains effectively branded an abuser : as the judge himself said , ` at the very lowest he will remain under suspicion until his daughters are old enough to be able to cope with any risk of abuse themselves ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
47	264	Furthermore , the mother 's beliefs are reinforced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
47	265	It thus becomes impossible for the parties and the children to put the issue of sexual abuse behind them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
47	266	The end result is highly unsatisfactory . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
47	267	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
47	268	This point raises a similar question in relation to section 1 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- e -RRB- as the House considered in re H -LRB- minors -RRB- -LRB- Sexual abuse : standard of proof -RRB- -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 563 in relation to section 31 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
47	269	In considering whether a child is at risk of suffering harm the court may take into account all the circumstances of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
47	270	But is this subject to the constraint that , as a matter of policy , the court may not infer the child is at risk of suffering harm in the future where the only evidence that the child is at risk is an unproved allegation that he suffered harm in the past ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
47	271	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
47	272	Butler-Sloss LJ , with her immense experience , seems to have entertained no doubt how this question ought to be answered : see -LSB- 1996 -RSB- 2 FLR 195 , 203 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
47	273	But the point does not call for decision on the present appeals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
47	274	Nor was the point fully argued before the appellate committee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
47	275	So I say only that , as at present advised , I find attractive the conclusions of the Court of Appeal in re M and R -LRB- Child abuse : evidence -RRB- -LSB- 1996 -RSB- 2 FLR 195 and in re P -LRB- Sexual abuse : standard of proof -RRB- -LSB- 1996 -RSB- 2 FLR 333 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
47	276	I do so , even though section 1 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- e -RRB- lacks the threshold context of section 31 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
47	277	It would be odd if , on this point , the approach in proceedings for a section 8 order were different from the approach in care proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
47	278	The present appeals 46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
47	279	I would allow the appeal concerning children L and C. I would set aside paragraphs 1 and 4 of the order of the Court of Appeal dated 26 July 2002 . 	lord nicholls	self	outcome	0.9	lord nicholls
47	280	The case should proceed on the footing of the facts proved and the views expressed by Judge Downey . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls

47	282	I would dismiss the appeal concerning child Y . 	lord nicholls	self	outcome	0.9	lord nicholls
47	283	In assessing risk the judge at the disposal hearing should have regard , among other matters , to the facts that the mother failed to protect child Y , that KR is the more probable perpetrator , and that the mother might have been the perpetrator . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
47	284	In each case the judge will of course have regard to events taking place during the unfortunate lapse of time which has occurred since the preliminary hearings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
