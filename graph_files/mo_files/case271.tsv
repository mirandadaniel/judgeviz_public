271	15	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown
271	16	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown
271	17	I agree that this appeal should be allowed , for the reasons given by my noble and learned friend , Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood . 	lady hale	self	outcome	0.1	lord brown
271	17	I agree that this appeal should be allowed , for the reasons given by my noble and learned friend , Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood . 	lady hale	lord brown	fullagr	0.1	lord brown
271	18	It is not strictly necessary , therefore , to express a view on the issues discussed by my noble and learned friend , Lord Mance , in paragraphs 42 to 53 of his opinion . 	lady hale	lord mance	partagr	0.1	lord brown
271	19	But they were fully canvassed in argument before us . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown
271	20	I feel it only fair , therefore , to confess that I share Lord Mance 's views upon those issues . 	lady hale	lord mance	NAN	0.1	lord brown
271	21	In my view the English court is seised of proceedings for the purpose of the Lugano Convention when the claim form is issued or when the court first makes an order against the defendant in connection with them , whichever is the earlier . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown
271	22	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown
271	23	The particular facts of this case happen to provide a good illustration of the artificiality of a different solution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown
271	24	These proceedings were a by-product of the estate 's proceedings against Mr Symes , in which Mrs Nussberger had already been involved as a witness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown
271	25	They were effectively begun by a worldwide freezing order against her of which she rapidly became aware . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown
271	26	In the county courts , the general rule has always been that the court itself effects service of the claim form , a rule which now applies throughout the civil justice system . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown
271	27	In this particular case , the court itself accepted the documents for service outside the jurisdiction in accordance with the Hague Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown
271	28	It is unsatisfactory if a claimant who has in fact begun his proceedings first in a court of competent jurisdiction can be excluded from that jurisdiction as a result of the vagaries of a service procedure over which he has no control . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown
271	29	There is no compelling reason for English law to adopt a service rule , given the lack of a concept of lis pendens . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown
271	30	All of this adds up to a powerful case for holding that the English court was seised of these proceedings long before 19 January 2005 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown
271	31	But , for the reasons Lord Brown has explained , it was certainly seised of them no later than that . 	lady hale	lord brown	partagr	0.1	lord brown

271	33	LORD BROWN OF EATON-UNDER-HEYWOOD 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown
271	34	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown
271	35	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown
271	36	The appellants are the administrators of the estate of Christo Michailidis who before his death was in partnership with Robin James Symes -LRB- now bankrupt -RRB- dealing in antiquities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord brown
271	37	Following Mr Michailidis ' death the appellants took proceedings against Mr Symes and various court orders were made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	38	On 14 February 2003 , in breach of those orders , Mr Symes sold a rare statue -LRB- an inlaid alabaster statue of the Egyptian Pharaoh , Akhenaten -RRB- to the second respondent for US$ 3m , no part of which has been paid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	39	The second respondent is a Swiss company , Galerie Nefer AG -LRB- `` Nefer '' -RRB- whose sole proprietor and sole officer is the first respondent , Frieda Nussberger -LRB- `` Mrs Nussberger '' -RRB- , herself of Swiss nationality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	40	Nefer seeks to justify the non-payment of the statue 's purchase price by reference to various claims exceeding US$ 3m which Mrs Nussberger asserts against the appellants and seeks to set off . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	41	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	42	By the present proceedings , begun by claim form issued out of the High Court on 16 December 2004 -LRB- the English proceedings -RRB- , the appellants claim US$ 3m against the respondents and in the alternative certain lesser sums or damages against four further defendants , including Mr Symes and his joint trustees in bankruptcy , whom I shall call simply `` the English defendants . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	43	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	44	Subsequently , on 3 February 2005 , in circumstances which I must shortly recount in some detail , the respondents themselves issued proceedings against the appellants in Switzerland -LRB- the Swiss proceedings -RRB- , claiming negative declaratory relief in respect of exactly the same facts as those the subject of the English proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	45	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	46	The question for the House is whether , in the light of the Swiss proceedings , the English court must itself now decline jurisdiction over the English proceedings and impose a stay . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	47	This in turn depends upon which court was first seised of proceedings within the meaning of article 21 of the Lugano Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters 1988 -LRB- `` the Lugano Convention '' -RRB- scheduled to the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 -LRB- `` the 1982 Act '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	48	Article 21 provides : `` Where proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties are brought in the courts of different contracting states , any court other than the court first seised shall of its own motion stay its proceedings until such time as the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	49	Where the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established , any court other than the court first seised shall decline jurisdiction in favour of that court . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	50	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	51	It is common ground that the English proceedings -LRB- at any rate as between the appellants and the respondents -RRB- and the Swiss proceedings -LRB- at least in so far as they seek declarations relating to the Akhenaten statue and the sale and proceeds of sale thereof -RRB- involve `` the same cause of action '' and are `` between the same parties . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	52	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	53	The European Court of Justice held in Zelger v Salinitri -LSB- 1984 -RSB- ECR 2397 that a court 's obligation under article 21 to decline jurisdiction in favour of another court only arises if it is established that the parallel proceedings have been `` definitively brought before a court in another state '' -LRB- para 14 of the Court 's judgment -RRB- and that it is for each state to determine when this is : `` ... the Court ` first seised ' is the one before which the requirements for proceedings to become definitively pending are first fulfilled , such requirements to be determined in accordance with the national law of each of the courts concerned . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	54	-LRB- para 16 of the Court 's judgment -RRB- 11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	55	English law has hitherto determined that proceedings become `` definitively pending '' only when they are served on the defendant -- see particularly Dresser UK Ltd v Falcongate Freight Management Ltd -LSB- 1992 -RSB- QB 502 -LRB- the Court of Appeal decision which first so decided -RRB- and Neste Chemicals SA v DK Line SA -LRB- The Sargasso -RRB- -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 3 AER 180 -LRB- a subsequent Court of Appeal decision holding that there could be no exceptions to the rule -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	56	Under Swiss law , however , proceedings are held to be `` definitively pending '' as soon as they are issued . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	57	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	58	In this case , therefore , the Swiss court became seised of the Swiss proceedings on 3 February 2005 when the respondents ' claim was issued . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	59	Had there already by then been service of the English proceedings upon the respondents such as to make the High Court `` the court first seised '' ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	60	That logically is the first question for your Lordships ' determination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord brown
271	61	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	62	The detailed circumstances of the case as to service are as follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	63	On 15 December 2004 , the day before the English claim form was issued , the appellants sought and obtained from Peter Smith J a worldwide freezing order against the respondents , restraining them from disposing of their assets up to a value of US$ 3m . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	64	The appellants undertook through counsel to issue a claim form and serve it on the respondents together with particulars of claim and various other documents underlying and including the order itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	65	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	66	On 16 December 2004 , as already stated , the Court issued the appellants ' claim form against the respondents and the English defendants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	67	In issuing the form , the staff at the Court Registry of the High Court erroneously stamped it `` Not for service out of the jurisdiction '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	68	This was a plain mistake because the claim form had expressly been rendered eligible for service out of the jurisdiction by a statement upon it , verified as true , stating that the High Court had power under the 1982 Act to hear the claim and that no proceedings concerning it were pending in any other relevant country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	69	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	70	Mrs Nussberger resides in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland , Nefer 's registered office being in Zurich . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	71	The proceedings , therefore , had to be served on them in accordance with the provisions of the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters -LRB- 1965 -RRB- -LRB- Cmmd 3986 -RRB- -LRB- `` the Hague Convention '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	72	Articles 2 and 3 of the Hague Convention require each contracting state to designate a `` central authority '' to effect service of such documents as are forwarded to it with a request in the appropriate form by the `` authority or judicial officer competent under the law of the state in which the documents originate . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	73	The competent judicial officer for English proceedings is the senior master of the Queen 's Bench Division , and the relevant Swiss central authority is , in Mrs Nussberger 's case , the Obergericht of Aargau ; in Nefer 's case , the Obergericht of Zurich . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	74	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	75	On 18 December the appellants filed requests for attachment -LRB- akin to freezing orders in England -RRB- with the Zurzach Court in Aargau and attachments were duly granted ex parte on 20 December . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	76	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	77	On 21 December 2004 Mrs Nussberger was served by the authorities in Zurich with the ex parte attachment orders together with Peter Smith J 's order of 15 December and -LRB- untranslated -RRB- particulars of claim in the English proceedings dated 17 December -LRB- a fully detailed claim extending to 22 pages -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	78	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	79	All the documents required by the order of 15 December 2004 to be served had first to be translated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	80	On 31 December , when this had been done , the appellants ' solicitors presented these documents to the foreign process section of the High Court for service on the respondents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	81	Included in these documents was the claim form , erroneously stamped `` Not for service out of the jurisdiction '' -LRB- and the German translation of the form including the stamp -RRB- , an error noticed both by the appellants ' solicitors and by the official at the foreign process section who nonetheless accepted the document for service . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	82	The senior master then arranged for the documents to be forwarded to the relevant legal authorities in Switzerland for service under the Hague Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	83	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	84	On 7 January 2005 the proceedings were served on the English defendants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	85	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord brown
271	86	On 19 January 2005 , at the end of a hearing in the Zurzach court held to review the Aargau attachment order made on 20 December , the Zurzach judge -LRB- deputed by the Aargau Obergericht to effect service on Mrs Nussberger under the Hague Convention -RRB- in the presence of the appellants ' solicitors handed her a package of documents for which she signed a receipt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	87	By then , however , unknown to anyone else , the judge or his clerk had in fact inspected the documents , removed from the package the English language claim form because of the words erroneously stamped upon it , and resealed the package without it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	88	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	89	On 24 January 2005 Mrs Nussberger and her lawyers learned that the claim form -LRB- although not the German translation of it -RRB- had been removed from the package of documents served upon her and on 3 February 2005 , as already stated , she and Nefer issued their own proceedings against the appellants in the Swiss court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	90	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	91	Only on receipt of a letter from the respondents ' Swiss lawyers dated 9 February 2005 did the appellants become aware that the claim form had been removed from the package of documents served upon Mrs Nussberger and that the respondents had themselves now commenced proceedings in Zurich . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	92	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	93	In a Hague Convention certificate dated 11 March 2005 an official of the Obergericht Aargau recorded that all the documents sent to the Zurzach court had been served on Mrs Nussberger except only the claim form , this document not being served because of the stamp it bore . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	94	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	95	In March 2005 the appellants also learned that no documents had been served on Nefer because of an error on the part of the Swiss Post Office . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	96	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	97	Having learned of the errors made in serving the respondents and the subsequent issue of Swiss proceedings , the appellants sought orders designed to ensure that the English proceedings had priority over the Swiss proceedings under article 21 of the Lugano Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	98	Following a five-day hearing , Peter Smith J on 19 August 2005 gave judgment -LRB- -LSB- 2005 -RSB- EWHC 1880 -LRB- Ch -RRB- -RRB- allowing the appellants ' application , dispensing with service of the claim form upon the respondents pursuant to CPR r. 6.9 and declaring that the High Court had become seised of the proceedings as against the respondents on 19 January 2005 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	99	Consequential directions were given and orders made to provide for further service of documents including acknowledgment of service forms to enable the action to proceed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	100	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	101	On 19 May 2006 the Court of Appeal -LRB- Pill , Neuberger and Wilson LJJ -RRB- allowed the respondents ' appeal , discharged the judge 's order , set aside the further service of documents effected pursuant to it , and stayed the proceedings pursuant to article 21 -LRB- -LSB- 2006 -RSB- 1 WLR 2598 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	102	The principal argument had centred upon CPR r. 3.10 and CPR r. 6.9 which provide as follows : 3.10 : `` Where there has been an error of procedure such as a failure to comply with a rule or practice direction -- -LRB- a -RRB- the error does not invalidate any step taken in the proceedings unless the court so orders ; and -LRB- b -RRB- the court may make an order to remedy the error . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	103	6.9 : `` -LRB- 1 -RRB- The court may dispense with service of a document . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	104	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	105	Put shortly , the court held that it would be ineffective -LRB- or , if effective , inappropriate -RRB- to invoke r. 6.9 to enable the English proceedings to enjoy article 21 priority : ineffective , because dispensing with the necessary service of the claim form could not take effect earlier than when the dispensing application was made -LRB- or perhaps , indeed , granted -RRB- and by then the Swiss proceedings had already obtained article 21 priority ; inappropriate , because in any event it would be wrong to apply r. 6.9 retrospectively specifically to disturb an already established order of priority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	106	-LRB- The court in addition rejected the appellants ' contention , pursuant to a respondent 's notice , that the English court becomes seised of proceedings under article 21 when the claim is filed at the High Court 's foreign process section rather than when thereafter it is actually served upon the defendant abroad . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	107	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	108	Before your Lordships the appellants have advanced a series of alternative arguments essentially as follows : -LRB- i -RRB- Dresser was wrongly decided and English proceedings should be held `` definitively pending '' as soon as they are issued ; -LRB- ii -RRB- The Sargasso was wrongly decided and the Dresser rule admits of exceptions , one of which should be that English proceedings are `` definitively pending '' once the court makes an interlocutory order against the defendant -LRB- as here the freezing order against the respondents -RRB- on the claimant 's undertaking to serve the proceedings ; -LRB- iii -RRB- proceedings are `` definitively pending '' once the claimant delivers the required documents to the foreign process section for service ; -LRB- iv -RRB- in a case involving multiple defendants , service on any of them -LRB- as here service on the English defendants on 7 January 2005 -RRB- is sufficient for the English court to be seised of the proceedings against all the defendants for the purposes of article 21 ; -LRB- v -RRB- the court below should have found that the service effected upon the respondents on 19 January 2005 was sufficient to satisfy the Dresser rule so as to confer first seisin upon the English court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	109	As I have already suggested , it is logical to address that final issue first . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord brown
271	110	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	111	It is clear that the claim form should have been included amongst the documents served upon the respondents on 19 January 2005 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	112	That is provided for by CPR r. 7.5 which dictates the period within which the claim form `` must be served on the defendant '' -LRB- six months if it is to be served out of the jurisdiction -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	113	It is no less clear , however , that -LRB- i -RRB- but for the error made by the Swiss judge or his clerk in removing the claim form from the package of documents sent to the Swiss authorities under the Hague Convention specifically for service , it would have been served , -LRB- ii -RRB- the documents in fact served included both the German translation of the claim form and -LRB- served again in English and this time in German translation too -RRB- the particulars of claim which set out in altogether greater detail than the claim form itself the nature of the appellants ' case , and -LRB- iii -RRB- the respondents accordingly suffered no prejudice from the omission of the English language claim form from the package of documents served but rather used the omission as the opportunity to seek to achieve first seisin in Switzerland . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	114	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	115	In these circumstances essentially two questions fall for your Lordships ' consideration : first , is there power in the court by virtue of CPR rr .3.10 and 6.9 to determine that the service of documents actually effected on 19 January 2005 constituted sufficient service for the court then to be seised of the proceedings as definitively pending before it under the Dresser rule ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	116	Secondly , if so , ought the court in its discretion to exercise that power ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	117	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	118	I have already set out the relevant rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	119	It seems to me at least arguable that even without resort to r. 6.9 the court could simply order under paragraph -LRB- b -RRB- of r. 3.10 that the respondents are to be regarded as properly served , certainly for the purposes of seisin . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	120	The `` error of procedure '' here was , of course , the omission of the English language claim form from the package of documents served : there was in this regard `` a failure to comply with the rule -LRB- r. 7.5 -RRB- . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	121	But that , says paragraph -LRB- a -RRB- of r. 3.10 , `` does not invalidate any step taken in the proceedings unless the court so orders '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	122	The relevant `` step '' taken here was service of the proceedings out of the jurisdiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	123	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	124	It seems to me that this was essentially the view taken by the majority of the Court of Appeal -LRB- McCowan LJ and Sir John Megaw , Lloyd LJ dissenting -RRB- in Golden Ocean Assurance Ltd v Martin -LRB- The Goldean Mariner -RRB- -LSB- 1990 -RSB- 2 Lloyd 's Rep. 215 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	125	Several defendants were there served out of the jurisdiction with copies of the writ , but in each case the wrong copy , addressed not to him but to a different defendant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	126	Another defendant , by an oversight , was served with no writ at all , only a form of acknowledgment of service . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	127	The court 's procedure at that time was governed by the RSC and the rule in point was O. 2 . r. 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	128	For present purposes I can see no material differences between that rule and CPR r. 3.10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	129	All three members of the court accepted that O. 2 . r. 1 was a most beneficial provision , to be given wide effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	130	The majority held that service , the step in the proceedings which had plainly been attempted , was to be regarded as valid in the case of all of the above defendants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	131	In the case of the defendants served with the wrong copy writs , Lloyd LJ accepted that the court had a discretion : `` The service was grossly defective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	132	But service , or purported service , it remained . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	133	Unlike the majority , however , he would not have exercised that discretion in the claimant 's favour . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord brown
271	134	As to the defendant served only with an acknowledgment of service , Lloyd LJ thought it `` an omission which is so serious that ... -LSB- i -RSB- t can not be described as a failure to comply with the requirements of the Rules by reason of something left undone ... The service of the form of acknowledgment can not make up for the absence of the writ . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	135	The majority thought otherwise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	136	There was , be it noted , no rule at that time akin to r. 6.9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	137	For my part I regard the errors and omissions committed in the process of effecting service there as if anything more , rather than less , serious than the error here -LRB- given the documents that were served here -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	138	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	139	The Court of Appeal thought The Goldean Mariner `` simply not in point '' because `` there was no question in that case of the retrospective validation of an ineffective attempt to serve the writ operating to affect , let alone to alter , the priority between English and foreign proceedings under an international Convention '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	140	With respect , I can not accept this reasoning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	141	The question in the The Goldean Mariner , just as the question here , is whether the `` attempt to serve the writ '' was or was not `` ineffective '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	142	It was held there to have been , not ineffective , but effective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	143	That was not a `` retrospective validation '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	144	Why should service not similarly be declared to have been effective here ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	145	The question is purely one for our domestic law , just as the question of when an English court is seised of proceedings is purely one for domestic law -LRB- and , indeed , the question of precisely what documents have to be served to achieve effective service out of the jurisdiction under the Hague Convention is purely one for domestic law -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	146	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	147	As I have said , therefore , it may not be necessary to invoke r. 6.9 at all in order to declare the service of documents effected on 19 January 2005 to have been valid and effective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	148	But assume , as both courts below clearly thought , that it is necessary for the court actually to dispense with service of the claim form under r. 6.9 before the service in fact effected can be declared valid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	149	Is that within the court 's power ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	150	The court below concluded not , on the basis that an order under r. 6.9 would by its very nature involve the retrospective validation of what ex hypothesi would otherwise fall to be regarded as ineffective service . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	151	And this essentially is the argument by which the respondents now seek to uphold the Court of Appeal 's judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	152	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	153	There are , however , as it seems to me , two complete answers to this argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	154	The first is this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	155	In making the order pursuant to rule 6.9 , Peter Smith J was not thereby declaring valid and effective service which had previously been ineffective ; rather he was holding the previous service to have been valid and declaring that it was unnecessary to have served the English language claim form to make it so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	156	It was in this sense that he was dispensing with service . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	157	There was no more question here , therefore , than in the The Goldean Mariner of `` retrospective validation '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord brown
271	158	The second answer is that even if a dispensing order under r. 6.9 was properly to be regarded as retrospectively validating what would otherwise have been ineffective service , in my judgment it would have been within the court 's power to make such an order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	159	True , its effect would then be to alter the jurisdictional precedence under an international Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	160	But if , as is uncontested , your Lordships could now overrule Dresser -LRB- just as the Court of Appeal in Dresser itself departed from the ruling at first instance that English courts are seised of proceedings at the date of issue -RRB- , the question of seisin being purely one for the national court , so too can an English court , applying its own procedural rules to dispense with service of a particular document , make an order which is effective retrospectively to validate what would otherwise have been an invalid form of service . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	161	I do not believe that this conclusion involves any exception to the Dresser rule : the rule surely is that the English court is seised of proceedings at the date of effective service , whatever that date may eventually be declared to have been . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	162	If , however , it does constitute an exception , so be it : to this limited extent I would if necessary qualify the decision in The Sargasso . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	163	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	164	So much for the court 's power to dispense with service under r. 6.9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	165	Should the court in its discretion exercise such power ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	166	That the court would do so in a purely domestic context is surely clear beyond argument , and this notwithstanding that the exercise of the power would operate to defeat a prospective Limitation Act defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	167	Is it , however , appropriate to make an order which has the effect of altering the priority of the seisin of proceedings under an international Convention ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	168	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	169	On any view the power is one to be exercised sparingly and only in the most exceptional circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	170	It is difficult to suppose , for example , that it could ever properly be exercised if there had been no process of service whatever . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	171	Consider in this regard article 27 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Lugano Convention : `` A judgment shall not be recognised ... -LRB- 2 -RRB- where it was given in default of appearance , if the defendant was not duly served with the document which instituted the proceedings or with an equivalent document in sufficient time to enable him to arrange for his defence . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	172	There can be no question here but that the respondents were served with `` an equivalent document '' : they had not only the German translation of the omitted claim form but the detailed particulars of claim -LRB- in both English and German -RRB- as well . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	173	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	174	In my judgment the circumstances here were indeed exceptional , the call on the exercise of the court 's discretion compelling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	175	As stated , the respondents plainly suffered no prejudice whatever by the failure to serve the original claim form but rather sought to exploit it , to steal a march on the appellants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	176	And the essential faults here were those of the Swiss authorities : of the judge or his clerk at the Zurzach court -LRB- however well-intentioned -RRB- in mistakenly removing the form from the package of documents for service and the Swiss Post Office in failing to find Nefer 's post-box -LRB- in each case substantially delaying notification of the problem to the appellants -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	177	If , moreover , the respondents are correct in their arguments under articles 21 and 22 of the Lugano Convention that , if the Swiss court here is properly to be regarded as first seised of the proceedings as between the appellants and the respondents , then neither the English court -LRB- in respect of the appellants ' claim against the English defendants -RRB- nor the Swiss court -LRB- in respect of the respondents ' claim against the appellants -RRB- has even a discretion to stay those respective claims , that would provide yet a further compelling reason for declaring the English court to be first seised of the whole action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	178	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	179	In short , the facts of this case could hardly be further from those of Knauf UK GmbH v British Gypsum Ltd -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 WLR 907 which involved a naked attempt to use CPR r. 6.8 to subvert the Brussels Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	180	I for my part have no doubt that discretion under r. 6.9 should -LRB- if necessary -RRB- be exercised here in the appellants ' favour and that the service effected on the respondents on 19 January 2005 should be declared valid and effective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	181	If your Lordships share my view , it follows that none of the other issues needs to be considered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	182	Given , moreover , that a completely new regime has now been put in place both by the EU -LRB- see the Jurisdiction and Judgment Regulation No. 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 -RRB- and by the Lugano Convention states -LRB- see the new Lugano Convention signed on 30 October 2007 and expected shortly to be ratified -RRB- -- whereby the time of seisin is defined autonomously instead of by the member states themselves -- it is surely inappropriate to review cases like Dresser and The Sargasso which will imminently lose all relevance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord brown
271	183	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown
271	184	In the result I would allow this appeal , set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal , restore paragraphs 1 and 4 of the order of the judge at first instance , and order that the questions of costs in this House be adjourned for the parties to make written submissions within 14 days . 	lord brown	self	outcome	0.8	lord brown
271	185	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown
271	186	LORD MANCE 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown
271	187	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown
271	188	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown
271	189	I have had the benefit of reading in draft the opinion of my noble and learned friend , Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood . 	lord mance	lord brown	ackn	0.8	lord brown
271	190	For reasons appearing in his opinion , I agree with him that , for the purposes of both English law and the Lugano Convention , effective service of the proceedings out of the jurisdiction was , and falls to be regarded as , made on Mrs Nussberger on 19th January 2005 without any retrospective validation . 	lord mance	lord brown	NAN	0.8	lord brown
271	191	The English court was thus on any view definitively seised of the proceedings as served on her on that date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown
271	192	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown
271	193	I would , for my part , also be prepared to go further and review the decisions of the Court of Appeal in Dresser v. Falcongate Freight Management Ltd. -LSB- 1992 -RSB- QB 502 and Neste Chemicals SA v. DK Line SA -LRB- The Sargasso -RRB- -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 2 Ll . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown
271	194	R. 6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown
271	195	I would conclude , having done so , that the English court was definitively seised of the whole proceedings from a still earlier date , being the date either of issue -LRB- 16th December 2004 -RRB- or of the freezing order -LRB- 15th December 2004 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown
271	196	In deciding whether to review those previous Court of Appeal decisions , the imminent replacement of the Lugano Convention would seem to me at best a neutral factor , once permission was given , as it was , to appeal to this House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown
271	197	I would not be deterred from such a review by the suggestion that it might affect any other current cases where jurisdiction in one state or another had been accepted on the basis of Dresser and The Sargasso . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown
271	198	If such cases exist , then , unless they are at a sufficiently early stage for issues of jurisdiction to be raised and argued in the ordinary course , it would probably be too late to raise them at all , but , even if not , it could well be possible for any decision by the House on this appeal to be so framed as to ensure that the settled course of such other cases was not disturbed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown
271	199	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown
271	200	The Court of Appeal in Dresser was faced with a choice , which it resolved in a different way to Hobhouse J at first instance who had taken the issue of the writ as the moment of seisin . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown
271	201	In my view , the choice made by Hobhouse J is , and would have been , preferable on several grounds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown
271	202	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown
271	203	First , the Court of Appeal 's contrary solution in Dresser was influenced by a view of the Advocate General 's reasoning in Zelger v. Salinitri -LRB- Case 129/83 -RRB- -LSB- 1984 -RSB- ECR 2397 and of the significance of the European Court 's use in its judgment in that case of the word `` definitively '' , which were the subject of a , to my mind convincing , critique in the judgment of my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann in Canada Trust Co. v. Stolzenberg -LRB- No. 2 -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 AC 1 , 18B-19F . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown
271	204	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown
271	205	Second , the Court in Dresser never contemplated the rigid rule later laid down by the Court in The Sargasso - indeed , one may even speculate that , if it had , then the advantages in this respect of issue over service might have prevailed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown
271	206	The important qualification which Bingham LJ stressed in his leading judgment in Dresser in 1991 was that it would be wrong , at so early a stage in the life of the Convention , `` to attempt to formulate any rule which will govern all problems which may arise in the future '' , and in this regard Bingham LJ said at p. 523F that `` the most obvious exception is where an actual exercise of jurisdiction -LRB- as by the granting of a Mareva injunction or the making of an Anton Piller order or the arrest of a vessel -RRB- precedes service : plainly the court is seised of proceedings when it makes an interlocutory order of that kind '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord brown
271	207	Yet in The Sargasso in 1994 the Court of Appeal was prepared to re-examine this qualification and to reject the existence of `` any genuine exceptions to the rule that the date of service marks the time when an English court becomes definitively seised of proceedings '' -LRB- per Steyn LJ at pp 11-12 ; and see per Peter Gibson LJ and Sir Tasker Watkins at pp 12-13 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	208	It adopted the argument -LRB- with which I would respectfully disagree -RRB- that the power , under article 24 of the former Brussels and present Lugano Convention , to give interim relief in aid of foreign proceedings militates against Bingham LJ 's view in Dresser that an English court giving such relief in aid of its own substantive proceedings is definitively seised of such proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	209	46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	210	Third , Bingham LJ in Dresser -LRB- at p.523A-C -RRB- indicated seven respects in which service had possible significance in English procedural law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	211	These were that : `` -LRB- 1 -RRB- the court 's involvement -LSB- in the issue of a writ is -RSB- confined to a ministerial act by a relatively junior administrative officer ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the plaintiff has an unfettered choice whether to pursue the action and serve the proceedings or not , being in breach of no rule or obligation if he chooses to let the writ expire unserved ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- the plaintiff 's claim may be framed in terms of the utmost generality ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- the defendant is usually unaware of the issue of proceedings and , if unaware , is unable to call on the plaintiff to serve or discontinue the action and unable to rely on the commencement of the action as a lis alibi pendens if proceedings are begun elsewhere ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- the defendant is not obliged to respond to the plaintiff 's claim in any way , and not entitled to do so save by calling on the plaintiff to serve or discontinue ; -LRB- 6 -RRB- the court can not exercise any powers which , on appropriate facts , it could not have exercised before issue ; -LRB- 7 -RRB- the defendant has not become subject to the jurisdiction of the court . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	212	47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	213	Even under English procedural rules as they stood in 1991 , I can not share the Court of Appeal 's view that these constitute clear pointers towards service rather than issue as the appropriate moment for the purposes of seisin under the then Brussels regime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	214	Hobhouse J 's choice provided , as Steyn LJ said in The Sargasso , `` a perfectly defensible solution , which yielded a readily comprehensible point of time when the Court becomes seised '' -LRB- p. 10 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	215	And , if the qualifications stressed by the Court of Appeal in Dresser are rejected -LRB- as the Court in The Sargasso considered that they should be -RRB- , this alone affects several of the pointers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	216	48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	217	The procedural significance attaching to issue and service in these pointers is also no longer the same under the Civil Procedure Rules : thus , as to the first respect , the court 's involvement is often not confined to issue , but extends to effecting service , unless the claimant opts to undertake this -LRB- cf CPR 6.3 -RRB- ; as to the second , fifth and seventh respects , the procedure now generally applicable under CPR 7.4 and 7.5 provides that a claim form must after issue be served on the defendant , and under these rules and CPR 15.4 it is no longer service of the claim form , but only the service of particulars of claim -LRB- which need not appear on the claim form and are not required to be served until 14 days after its service -RRB- , that imposes on a defendant any obligation to defend ; as to the fourth respect , the defendant 's potential lack of awareness of English proceedings until service must be seen in the light of the reality that defendants are very often aware of such proceedings and have often -LRB- as in the present case -RRB- sought to use the inevitable delay in foreign service to try to avoid them -LRB- see further the fourth ground below -RRB- ; and as to both the sixth and seventh respects , the corollary of the Court of Appeal 's view in Dresser that issue gave rise to no new powers over a defendant was its view -LRB- rejected in The Sargasso -RRB- that , where powers were exercised over the defendant before issue , the court was then seised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	218	49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	219	Fourth , the decisions in Dresser and The Sargasso have proved to generate considerable scope for pre-emptive forum shopping , and were also reached without consideration of the particular implications for multi-defendant proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	220	These points are evidenced by a number of cases , including Grupo Torras S.A. v. Al-Sabah -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 1 Ll.R . 374 ; -LSB- 1996 -RSB- 1 Ll.R . 7 -LRB- CA -RRB- , Tavoulareas v. Tsavlaris -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 1 Ll.R . 455 -LRB- CA -RRB- and the present . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	221	Pragmatic considerations of this nature were , in contrast , influential in the House 's decision in Canada Trust Co. v. Stolzenberg -LRB- No. 2 -RRB- to take the date of issue as the relevant date at which to ascertain whether the defendant was domiciled in a contracting state for the purpose of establishing jurisdiction under article 2 of the Brussels Convention : see especially at pp. 9H and 12 B-E per Lord Steyn -LRB- with whose speech Lord Cooke of Thorndon , Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough all agreed -RRB- and pp.22F-23C per Lord Hoffmann . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	222	50 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	223	Fifth , there is a natural conjunction between the moment of seisin and the date relevant for the purpose of establishing domicile . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	224	Yet Dresser and The Sargasso on the one hand and Canada Trust Co. v. Stolzenberg -LRB- No. 2 -RRB- on the other take different dates for these two purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	225	Indeed , to reconcile the result reached in Canada Trust Co. v. Stolzenberg -LRB- No. 2 -RRB- with the decisions in Dresser and The Sargasso , article 52 -LRB- which , in the case of a party not domiciled in the state `` whose courts are seised of the matter '' , requires such courts to apply the law of state B in order to determine `` whether the party is domiciled '' in state B -RRB- had to be treated as if the word `` is '' read `` was '' -LRB- cf pp.9H-10A per Lord Steyn -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	226	Otherwise , as Lord Steyn said , the `` absurd consequence '' would follow that the date relevant to domicile depended on various fortuitous consequences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	227	But such consequences are avoided , more convincingly and consistently with the language , by judging both seisin and domicile as at the date of issue of proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	228	51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	229	I would therefore , so far as it may be necessary in order to resolve this appeal , adopt a general test of issue as the relevant date for seisin under article 21 of the Lugano Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	230	That moment has the advantage , which the Court identified in The Sargasso , of offering a single certain and easily ascertainable date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord brown
271	231	But , if that were not to be accepted , then I would revert to the more nuanced test of seisin which the Court adopted in Dresser itself , which in the present case would be satisfied by virtue of the interim injunction granted against the respondents in aid of the substantive English proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown
271	232	52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown
271	233	Had I accepted neither of those solutions , I would have been prepared to look carefully once again at the principles which should under the present Lugano regime cover a multi-defendant case such as the present once one defendant has been effectively served . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown
271	234	If it were possible to treat a court at least as seised of the whole proceedings once one of the parties to , or at least one of the parties common to , the two sets of proceedings had been served , that would recognise that this event and moment have real significance -LRB- cf my observations in Grupo Torras -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 1 Ll.R . 374 , 419 -RRB- ; it would assist to ensure the integrity of proceedings and counter the possibility of procedural manoeuvring by co-defendants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown
271	235	53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown
271	236	There can be little doubt , and Mr Martin QC for the respondents accepted , that article 22 requires a single date of composite seisin , which would on the basis of Dresser be ascertained by reference to the date when the first party was served in either set of proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown
271	237	For article 21 to apply there must be proceedings in different contracting states between parties at least some of whom are identical on each side , and article 21 then applies , and only applies , as between those who are identical : The Tatry v . The Maciej Rataj -LRB- Case C-406 / 92 -RRB- -LSB- 1999 -RSB- QB 515 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown
271	238	It does not necessarily follow that the court should then be regarded as seised by considering , on an identical party to identical party basis , which party was first served . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown
271	239	The Tatry did not concern or consider any such situation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown
271	240	But I need not go so far down a chain of hypotheticals as to express any view on any aspect of the area of multi-party litigation , save that it would have merited at least some further thought . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown
271	241	54 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord brown
271	242	The conclusions reached in paragraphs 41 to 51 above mean that I would allow this appeal , set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal , restore the order of the judge at first instance and order that the questions of costs in this House be adjourned for the parties to make written submissions within 14 days . 	lord mance	self	outcome	1	lord brown
