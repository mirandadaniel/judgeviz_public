269	5	To fish for Patagonian toothfish in the Maritime Zone adjacent to South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands -LRB- `` SGSSI '' -RRB- it is necessary to hold an annual licence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	6	Licences are granted by the Director of Fisheries of SGSSI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	7	They are a valuable commercial asset , since the fishing is very profitable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	8	Quark Fishing Limited , a Falkland Islands company , obtained such a licence for its motor vessel Jacqueline in each year from 1997-2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	9	In 2001 it applied again . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	10	But the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs on 7 June 2001 formally instructed the Commissioner of SGSSI to direct the Director of Fisheries of SGSSI to allocate licences for the 2001 season in a way which precluded the grant of a licence to Quark for Jacqueline . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	11	The instruction was followed and the licence withheld . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	12	Quark challenged the lawfulness of the Secretary of State 's instruction on conventional public law grounds , and succeeded both in the High Court and on appeal : -LSB- 2001 -RSB- EWHC Admin 1174 ; -LSB- 2002 -RSB- EWCA Civ 1409 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	13	There is no further appeal on that aspect of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	14	But an issue remains whether Quark is entitled to damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	15	On that issue , raised by an application to strike out , decisions adverse to Quark have been made by Collins J at first instance -LRB- -LSB- 2003 -RSB- EWHC 1743 -LRB- Admin -RRB- -RRB- and the Court of Appeal -LRB- Pill , Thomas and Jacob LJJ , -LSB- 2004 -RSB- EWCA Civ 527 , -LSB- 2005 -RSB- QB 93 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	16	It is now accepted that Quark can recover damages against the Secretary of State only if it can show that his admittedly unlawful instruction violated its rights under article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights so as to render him liable in damages under sections 6 and 7 of the Human Rights Act 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	17	But an anterior question has been raised , whether the Secretary of State , when giving his unlawful instruction , was acting for Her Majesty the Queen in right of the United Kingdom -LRB- as Quark argues -RRB- or in right of SGSSI -LRB- as the Secretary of State now argues -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	18	Collins J decided both questions against Quark . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	19	The Court of Appeal disagreed on the anterior issue , holding that the instruction had been given by the Secretary of State on behalf of Her Majesty in right of the United Kingdom , and the Secretary of State challenges that ruling before the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	20	But the Court of Appeal agreed with the judge that no claim could lie under the 1998 Act and the First Protocol , and Quark challenges that ruling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	21	SGSSI 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	22	SGSSI was acquired by the Crown by settlement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	23	Its government was established under the British Settlements Acts 1887 and 1945 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	24	From 1908 until 18 April 1985 it was a British Dependent Territory and a Dependency of the Falkland Islands . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	25	But on the latter date , when the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands Order 1985 -LRB- SI 1985/449 -RRB- came into effect , it ceased to be a Dependency . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	26	It is now a British Overseas Territory as defined in the British Overseas Territories Act 2002 , and its constitution is governed by the 1985 Order as amended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	27	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	28	Under section 4 of the 1985 Order as amended there is a Commissioner for the Territories appointed by Her Majesty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	29	His powers and duties are laid down in section 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- : `` The Commissioner shall have such powers and duties as are conferred or imposed upon him by or under this Order or any other law and such other powers and duties as Her Majesty may from time to time be pleased to assign to him and , subject to the provisions of this Order and of any other law by which any such powers or duties are conferred or imposed , shall do and execute all things that belong to his office according to such instructions , if any , as Her Majesty may from time to time see fit to give him through a Secretary of State . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	30	The instruction complained of in these proceedings was given under this subsection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	31	The Commissioner has wide powers : to make laws for the peace , order and good government of the Territories -LRB- section 9 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- ; to constitute offices and make appointments -LRB- section 7 -RRB- ; to make grants of land -LRB- section 14 -RRB- ; to establish courts of justice , including a Supreme Court -LRB- section 13 -RRB- ; and to grant pardons and remit sentences -LRB- section 11 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	32	But in matters touching on defence and security the Commissioner must follow the advice of the officer commanding Her Majesty 's Forces in the South Atlantic -LRB- section 5 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -RRB- , and the Commissioner 's exercise of other powers is subject to the instructions and control of the Secretary of State . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
269	33	Thus the Commissioner holds office during Her Majesty 's pleasure -LRB- section 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , as amended -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	34	His powers and duties are those assigned to him by Her Majesty , with whose instructions he is bound to comply -LRB- section 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , above -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	35	The Commissioner 's power to make laws is subject to the instructions of Her Majesty through a Secretary of State ; the Commissioner must so far as practicable observe the rules set out in an annex to the Order ; and laws made by him may be disallowed by Her Majesty -LRB- sections 9 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , 10 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	36	The power to constitute offices is limited to such offices as may be constituted by Her Majesty , subject to local laws and subject to any instructions given -LRB- section 7 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	37	The power to dispose of land is subject to local laws and any instructions given -LRB- section 14 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	38	Pardons and remissions of sentence are to be granted in Her Majesty 's name and on her behalf -LRB- section 11 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	39	SGSSI is a legal entity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	40	But the United Kingdom is responsible for its external relations and thus has the responsibility in international law for ensuring compliance with those international obligations which apply to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	41	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	42	SGSSI is a remote territory , far to the south of the Falkland Islands , close to the Antarctic Circle , and it has no inhabitants other than a transient population of about 12 scientists . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	43	Thus it is no surprise that it lacks the institutions -LRB- representative assembly , legislative council , courts and so on -RRB- ordinarily to be expected in a British Overseas Territory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	44	The regulation of fishing in SGSSI waters 5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	45	In May 1993 the then Commissioner of SGSSI declared a Maritime Zone extending some 200 nautical miles from SGSSI , within which the government of SGSSI was to have exclusive jurisdiction over fisheries . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	46	Pursuant to powers conferred on him by the 1985 Order , the Commissioner enacted The Fisheries -LRB- Conservation and Management -RRB- Ordinance 1993 which , with the Fishing -LRB- Maritime Zone -RRB- Order 1993 , controlled fishing within the Maritime Zone by introducing a licensing regime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	47	Despite revocation and replacement of the first-mentioned Ordinance in 2000 , the regime has remained in force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	48	The Commissioner was required to appoint a Director of Fisheries who should administer the Ordinance and be responsible , among other things , for the conservation of fish stocks , the development and management of fisheries , the regulation of the conduct of fishing and `` the issue , variation , suspension and revocation of licences for fishing and fishing - related operations '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	49	Save in relation to prosecutions , the Director is under the direction of the Commissioner : section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 2000 Ordinance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	50	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	51	By section 4 -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the 2000 Ordinance the Director is required when discharging his duties to have regard to the provisions of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources -LRB- `` the Conservation Convention '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	52	This was adopted in 1980 and came into force 2 years later . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	53	It was negotiated to address , among other things , the threat of over-exploitation of fin-fish in the Southern Ocean . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	54	It forms part of the Antarctic Treaty System , a body of treaties , agreements and regulations that provide for the orderly governance of Antarctica . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	55	The evidence shows that the United Kingdom is committed to the Antarctic Treaty System as the means by which the political and environmental security of the area can best be maintained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	56	The United Kingdom was an original signatory of the Conservation Convention , whose members now include 23 states and the European Commission including the United Kingdom but not SGSSI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	57	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	58	The evidence makes plain that the control of fishing in Antarctic waters raises questions much wider than those of conservation and management . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	59	In the original judicial review proceedings , Laws LJ -LRB- in para 57 of his judgment -RRB- observed : `` The limitation of the number of licences to be issued to British-registered vessels to two , against the Director 's recommendation of four , was arrived at as a matter of judgment in the field of foreign policy . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	60	This was echoed by Pill LJ in para 25 of the judgment under appeal : `` Thus there was a strong political and diplomatic motive for the intervention and instruction of the Secretary of State . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	61	This has not been challenged by the Secretary of State , and could not be challenged since it reflects the evidence which he adduced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	62	The first issue 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	63	The first issue , raised by the Secretary of State 's appeal , is agreed by the parties to be : `` Whether the Court of Appeal was correct to conclude that the Instruction of 7 June 2001 issued by Her Majesty through her Secretary of State was issued by Her Majesty in right of the United Kingdom . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	64	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	65	The instruction in issue in this case was given to the Commissioner -LRB- who was required to direct the Director -RRB- by the Secretary of State . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	66	He was not of course acting on his own behalf but on behalf of the Crown , from which his authority derived . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	67	But it is now clear , whatever may once have been thought , that the Crown is not one and indivisible : R v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs , Ex p Indian Association of Alberta -LSB- 1982 -RSB- QB 892 , 911 , 916-917 , 920-921 , 928 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	68	The Queen is as much the Queen of New South Wales -LRB- In re Bateman 's Trust -LRB- 1873 -RRB- 15 Eq 355 , 361 -RRB- and Mauritius -LRB- R v Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex p Bhurosah -LSB- 1968 -RSB- 1 QB 266 , 284 -RRB- and other territories acknowledging her as head of state as she is of England and Wales , Scotland , Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	69	Thus the Secretary of State as a servant of the Crown exercises executive power on behalf of the Crown in whatever is , for purposes of that exercise of executive power , the relevant capacity of the Crown . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	70	The question which divides the parties is : by what test is the relevant capacity of the Crown to be ascertained ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	71	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	72	The Secretary of State through Mr Crow submits , in very brief summary , that the answer is found by identifying the system of government within which the particular exercise of executive power takes place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	73	Here the relevant system of government is that established by the 1985 Order as amended , which contains the constitution of SGSSI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	74	It makes plain that the Queen is the head of state and the source of authority in the state . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	75	Those who hold office locally do so during her pleasure and subject to her instructions and control . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	76	While instructions may be transmitted to the Commissioner by the Secretary of State he does so , in constitutional theory , as her mouthpiece or medium . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	77	He is passing on her instructions as Queen of SGSSI , not acting as Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	78	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	79	Mr Vaughan QC for Quark contends that the answer is found not in an analysis of the relevant constitutional arrangements , or not in them alone , but in an evaluation of the facts underlying the exercise of power which is subject to challenge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	80	Here , he says , the decision to instruct the Commissioner was animated by concern for the wider interests of the United Kingdom and not solely by concern for the particular interests of SGSSI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	81	He places reliance on the political and diplomatic motivation of the Secretary of State 's instruction to suggest that this was , in truth , an exercise of power on behalf of Her Majesty 's Government of the United Kingdom , not Her Majesty 's Government of SGSSI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	82	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	83	Any constitution , whether of a state , a trade union , a college , a club or other institution seeks to lay down and define , in greater or lesser detail , the main offices in which authority is vested and the powers which may be exercised -LRB- and not exercised -RRB- by the holders of those offices . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	84	Thus if a question arises on what authority or pursuant to what power an act is done , it is to the constitution that one would turn to find the answer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	85	Here , it is plain that the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom has no power or authority under the constitution of SGSSI -LRB- the 1985 Order , as amended -RRB- to instruct the Commissioner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	86	Such power and authority can be exercised only by the Queen , who in this context is -LRB- and is only -RRB- the Queen of SGSSI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	87	It is in my view correct in constitutional theory to regard the Secretary of State as her mouthpiece and medium . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	88	This analysis points , in my view strongly , to the correctness of the Secretary of State 's submission , but it is necessary to examine the authorities to see if they suggest a different answer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	89	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	90	From The Queen in Right of Alberta v Canadian Transport Commission -LRB- 1977 -RRB- 75 DLR -LRB- 3d -RRB- 257 , 259 , is derived the proposition , which can not I think be doubted , that the Crown in right of Alberta may be equated with the Government of Alberta . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	91	Thus it is the Government of SGSSI with which the House is here concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	92	Little help is gained from Bhurosah , above : the appellants claimed to be holders of United Kingdom passports , but the definition of that expression in section 1 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 , quoted at p 283 of the report , made that contention , on the facts , all but unarguable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	93	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	94	In Tito v Waddell -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 1977 -RSB- Ch 106 , an issue arose , in relation to what was called `` the 1931 transaction '' , whether the acts of which the claimants complained were done on behalf of the Government of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony -LRB- in which case no claim lay against the Crown , because excluded by section 40 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 -RRB- or the Government of the United Kingdom -LRB- in which case , if a claim lay , it was not excluded -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	95	Sir Robert Megarry V-C -LRB- at p 254 -RRB- accepted that the colonial government was plainly a subordinate government , all important decisions being referred to London , and the Crown , on the advice of the United Kingdom Government , having important powers that could be used to override acts of the colonial government . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	96	But the Vice-Chancellor concluded -LRB- at p 255 -RRB- : `` In my judgment the government of the United Kingdom was not the government of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony at any material time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
269	97	It had important advisory and supervisory functions , as well as paramount powers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	98	It also contributed much to the governing of the colony , in general and to the 1931 transaction in particular , eg in settling the form of the 1931 lease ; but it was not the government . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	99	Quark was unable satisfactorily to distinguish this authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	100	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	101	In Ex p Indian Association of Alberta , above , the issue -LRB- see p 909 -RRB- was whether obligations which the applicants sought to enforce were owed by `` Her Majesty in right of Her Government in the United Kingdom '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	102	It was argued on their behalf , presumably to establish their claim , that Canada still did not enjoy full independence from the United Kingdom since there remained an ultimate power to deny Royal Assent to Canadian legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	103	Both Lord Denning MR and May LJ concluded that any obligations were now owed by the Crown in respect or right of Canada , not the United Kingdom -LRB- at pp 919 , 937 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	104	But Kerr LJ addressed the argument more directly and said -LRB- at p 927 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	105	`` With respect , in my judgment this argument is wholly fallacious . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	106	As shown by the basic constitutional principles discussed at the beginning of this judgment , it is perfectly clear that the question whether the situs of rights and obligations of the Crown is to be found in right or respect of the United Kingdom , or of other governments within those parts of the Commonwealth of which Her Majesty is the ultimate sovereign , has nothing whatever to do with the question whether those governments are wholly independent or not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	107	The situs of such rights and obligations rests with the overseas governments within the realm of the Crown , and not with the Crown in right or respect of the United Kingdom , even though the powers of such governments fall a very long way below the level of independence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	108	Indeed , independence , or the degree of independence , is wholly irrelevant to the issue , because it is clear that rights and obligations of the Crown will arise exclusively in right or respect of any government outside the bounds of the United Kingdom as soon as it can be seen that there is an established government of the Crown in the overseas territory in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	109	In relation to Canada this had clearly happened by 1867 . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	110	Unusually , a five-member appeal committee of the House of Lords heard a petition for leave to appeal , and Lord Diplock gave reasons for dismissing it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	111	He regarded the petitioners ' contention as unarguable for the accumulated reasons given in the judgments of the Court of Appeal -LRB- see pp 937-938 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	112	These include the observations of Kerr LJ which I have quoted , and the express approval of the committee , including in Lord Diplock a notable authority in this area , must give them even greater weight . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	113	Reliance was placed , finally , on the decision of the Queen 's Bench Divisional Court in R -LRB- Bancoult -RRB- v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs -LSB- 2001 -RSB- QB 1067 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	114	In that case the applicant sought judicial review of an ordinance made by the commissioner for the British Indian Ocean Territory under powers similar to those conferred by the 1985 Order on the Commissioner for SGSSI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	115	The Secretary of State and the commissioner were both respondents to the application , and an issue was raised whether the High Court in London had jurisdiction to entertain the proceedings and grant relief . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	116	In ruling that it had , Laws LJ -LRB- in para 28 of his judgment -RRB- said that `` the Crown 's reliance on the proposition that the Ordinance is a legal creature of the government of BIOT which must be taken to possess a separate and distinct sovereignty of its own , such that the Queen 's courts sitting here in London have nothing to do with the matter , represents in my judgment an abject surrender of substance to form '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	117	He pointed out that the ordinance had been made on the orders or at the direction of Her Majesty 's ministers here , in right of the Government of the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	118	The court held that it had ample jurisdiction to quash an instrument the making of which had been wholly procured by Her Majesty 's Government of the United Kingdom , and it did so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	119	In the present case , the Secretary of State 's instruction has been quashed , and there is no challenge to the court 's jurisdiction to make that order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	120	So the jurisdictional issue in Bancoult does not arise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	121	It is however appropriate , in my opinion , to decide in this case whether the instruction given by Her Majesty through the Secretary of State was given in right of the Government of SGSSI or that of the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	122	I do not understand the court in Bancoult to have ruled or found it necessary to rule , in order to resolve the jurisdictional issue , whether the ordinance had been made by Her Majesty in right of the Government of the BIOT or in right of the Government of the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	123	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	124	None of the authorities cited is directly in point , and they do not conclude the issue in the Secretary of State 's favour or against him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	125	But they do in my view assist him , because they show that the possession and exercise of powers by a paramount government does not preclude recognition of the acts of a subordinate government as acts of the Crown in right of that government . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	126	And in none of the cases was it thought necessary to examine facts pertaining to the motivation of the paramount government . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	127	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	128	The extreme difficulty of exploring governmental motivation in a context such as this , and its unsuitability for judicial determination , reinforce the Secretary of State 's argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	129	The present case illustrates the point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	130	There were of course matters strictly relating to the conduct of fishing in the Maritime Zone which were , or should have been , considered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	131	These may be regarded as pure SGSSI issues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	132	But the wider political and diplomatic issues alluded to above , while of obvious importance to the United Kingdom as a power with extensive overseas interests , can not be dismissed as irrelevant to the interests of SGSSI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	133	Given that the continuing status of SGSSI as a British Overseas Territory is not accepted without question by some significant states in the region , the promotion of international harmony may well be seen to contribute to the security of SGSSI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	134	To treat the allocation of motive as the basis for attributing an exercise of executive power to one government rather than another would , in my opinion , be hazardous and unreliable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	135	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	136	Collins J , before whom this question was not -LRB- it seems -RRB- very fully argued , concluded in para 34 of his judgment that `` there is no question but that in acting pursuant to the 1985 Ordinance , the -LSB- Secretary of State -RSB- was acting on behalf of the Crown in right of government of SGSSI . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	137	The Court of Appeal reached a different view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	138	In doing so , it observed -LRB- para 48 -RRB- that under the 1985 Order there `` is a very considerable reservation of powers to the Secretary of State '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	139	But this is not so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	140	There is a considerable reservation of powers to Her Majesty , as Queen of SGSSI , but none to the Secretary of State . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	141	It went on to suggest -LRB- para 50 -RRB- , borrowing the language of Laws LJ in Bancoult , that `` it would be an abject surrender of substance to form to treat the instruction given by the Secretary of State on behalf of Her Majesty as one given in right of -LSB- SGSSI -RSB- '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	142	But I do not think the issue is properly to be regarded as a contest between substance and form : it turns on identifying the correct constitutional principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	143	While the court accepted -LRB- para 51 -RRB- that the reason why a particular decision is taken can not be determinative of the construction of the instruction , it held that the instruction had nevertheless to be construed in the context of a factual matrix which included the political and diplomatic context of the instruction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	144	Here , there is no issue of construction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	145	What is in issue is the constitutional standing of the instruction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	146	The factual matrix might , I accept , be relevant if there were in a given territory no government , or no government worthy of the name , other than the United Kingdom Government . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	147	There would then be no government other than that of the United Kingdom Government on whose behalf an exercise of executive power could be made , no other government in right of which the Queen could act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	148	But that is not this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	149	Here , there is nothing to displace the initial inference that the instruction was given by Her Majesty , through the Secretary of State , in right of the government of SGSSI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	150	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	151	I would accordingly answer this issue in the negative : the Court of Appeal was not correct to rule as it did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	152	The second issue 21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	153	The second issue was agreed in terms which indicated that it arose only if the first issue were answered affirmatively : `` If so , whether the Court of Appeal was correct to conclude that the Instruction issued by Her Majesty in right of the United Kingdom and given to the Commissioner of -LSB- SGSSI -RSB- was incapable of giving rise to a claim for damages under section 7 of the Human Rights Act 1998 '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	154	Thus the parties assumed that no claim for damages under section 7 could lie if the instruction were held to have been given by Her Majesty in right of SGSSI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	155	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	156	In my opinion this was a wholly correct assumption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	157	Since this conclusion is not , I think , in serious controversy I can give my reasons for reaching it very briefly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	158	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	159	To recover damages under section 7 of the 1998 Act , Quark must show that its rights under the European Convention have been violated by a public authority liable under the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	160	So the essential stepping stones to success are a demonstrated breach of a Convention right and an answerable public authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	161	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
269	162	The Convention right asserted is that under article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	163	At this stage it is accepted , for purposes of argument , that denial of a fishing licence in 2001 may in the circumstances have amounted to deprivation of a possession within the meaning of article 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	164	But although it is common ground that the United Kingdom acted under article 63 -LRB- now 56 -RRB- of the Convention to extend its coverage to SGSSI , it is also common ground that it has not taken similar action under article 4 of the First Protocol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	165	That Protocol has not been extended to SGSSI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	166	Thus a party complaining of conduct which would be a violation by SGSSI , for which the United Kingdom would be answerable , if the Protocol had been extended , would inevitably fail in an application to the Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg if -LRB- as is the case -RRB- the Protocol had not been extended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	167	This principle is clearly established by Strasbourg authorities such as X v Belgium -LRB- 1961 -RRB- 4 YB 260 , Gillow v United Kingdom -LRB- 1986 -RRB- 11 EHRR 335 , Bui van Thanh v United Kingdom -LRB- Application No 16137/90 , 12 March 1990 , -LRB- unreported -RRB- and Yonghong v Portugal , Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1999 - IX , p 385 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	168	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	169	A party unable to mount a successful claim in Strasbourg can never mount a successful claim under sections 6 and 7 of the 1998 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	170	For the purpose of the 1998 Act was not to enlarge the field of application of the Convention but to enable those subject to the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom and able to establish violations by United Kingdom public authorities to present their claims in the domestic courts of this country and not only in Strasbourg . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	171	The territorial focus of the Act is clearly shown by the definition of `` the Convention '' in section 21 to mean the European Convention `` as it has effect for the time being in relation to the United Kingdom '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	172	In any event , the Secretary of State acting on behalf of Her Majesty in right of SGSSI is not a United Kingdom public authority , and so falls outside the scope of section 6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	173	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	174	It may very well be , as the Court of Appeal held , that a claim by Quark would not lie under the 1998 Act even if the Secretary of State had given his instruction on behalf of Her Majesty in right of the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	175	But it is unnecessary to decide that question , and I see no advantage in doing so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	176	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	177	For these reasons I would allow the Secretary of State 's appeal and dismiss Quark 's cross-appeal . 	lord bingham	self	outcome	0.3	NAN

269	185	The question raised by this appeal is whether a direction given in London by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs to the local government in South Georgia regarding property there is capable of being an act by a ` public authority ' incompatible with a ` Convention right ' within the meaning of the Human Rights Act and as such founding a claim for damages under section 7 of that Act .

269	195	In these judicial review proceedings Quark successfully challenged the lawfulness of the Secretary of State 's instruction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	196	This aspect of the dispute is no longer in contention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	197	What remains in issue is whether , as Quark submits , it is entitled to pursue a damages claim pursuant to section 7 of the Human Rights Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	198	Quark claims it is the victim of an unlawful act of a public authority , namely the Secretary of State . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	199	The Secretary of State 's instruction , Quark says , was incompatible with a Convention right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	200	Accordingly it was an unlawful act within the meaning of section 6 of the Human Rights Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	201	The Convention right said to have been violated is article 1 of the First Protocol -LRB- protection of property -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

269	205	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	206	The issue is thus a comparatively narrow one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	207	There can of course be no doubt that , had the impugned instruction been given by the Secretary of State in respect of property within the United Kingdom , it would have been capable of giving rise to a damages claim under section 7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	208	The question is whether the position is different if the instruction is given to the local government of an overseas territory in respect of a property right situated there . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	209	The territorial scope of the Human Rights Act 32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	210	In resolving this dispute the appropriate starting point is to consider whether , as asserted by Quark , the Secretary of State 's instruction was incompatible with a Convention right within the meaning of that expression in sections 6 and 7 of the Human Rights Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	211	The Act does not attempt to define in express terms what may loosely be called its territorial scope . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	212	Wisely so , because ` territoriality ' has many aspects . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	213	Questions on the application of this slippery concept can arise in many different contexts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	214	This is especially true of a statute having such a wide range of application as the Human Rights Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	215	The only clues given by the Act lie in the definition of its subject-matter : section 1 defines the key concept of ` Convention rights ' by reference to specified articles of the Convention and its protocols , section 21 -LRB- 1 -RRB- defines ` the Convention ' as the European Convention on Human Rights ` as it has effect for the time being in relation to the United Kingdom ' , and section 7 -LRB- 7 -RRB- provides that a person is a victim of an unlawful act only if he would be a victim for the purposes of article 34 of the Convention if proceedings were brought in the European Court of Human Rights in respect of that act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	216	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	217	At first sight these unexceptional definitions might seem to be of little assistance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	218	But that is not so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	219	What is important is that they carry through the scheme underlying the whole Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	220	The purpose of the Act , as stated in its preamble , was ` to give further effect to rights and freedoms guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	221	In colloquial terms , the Act was intended to ` bring rights home ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	222	The Act was to provide a means whereby persons whose rights under the Convention were infringed by the United Kingdom could , in future , have an appropriate remedy available to them in the courts of this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	223	Persons who were victims of a violation of a Convention right within the meaning of article 34 of the Convention need no longer travel to Strasbourg to obtain redress . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	224	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	225	To this end the obligations of public authorities under sections 6 and 7 mirror in domestic law the treaty obligations of the United Kingdom in respect of corresponding articles of the Convention and its protocols . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
269	226	That was the object of these sections . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	227	As my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead has said , the ` purpose of these sections is to provide a remedial structure in domestic law for the rights guaranteed by the Convention ' : Aston Cantlow and Wilmcote with Billesley Parochial Church Council v Wallbank -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 1 AC 546 , 564 , para 44 . 	lord nicholls	lord hope	partagr	0.4	NAN
269	228	Thus , and this is the important point for present purposes , the territorial scope of the obligations and rights created by sections 6 and 7 of the Act was intended to be co-extensive with the territorial scope of the obligations of the United Kingdom and the rights of victims under the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	229	The Act was intended to provide a domestic remedy where a remedy would have been available in Strasbourg . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	230	Conversely , the Act was not intended to provide a domestic remedy where a remedy would not have been available in Strasbourg . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	231	Accordingly , in order to identify the territorial scope of a ` Convention right ' in sections 6 and 7 it is necessary to turn to Strasbourg and consider what , under the Convention , is the territorial scope of the relevant Convention right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	232	The Human Rights Act and Article 56 extensions 35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	233	Before doing so I must mention one qualification , more apparent than real , in respect of this analysis of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	234	It is this : sections 6 and 7 of the Act are confined in their scope to Convention rights arising from obligations assumed by the United Kingdom under the Convention and its protocols other than the extended obligations assumed by the United Kingdom pursuant to a notification given by it under article 56 or equivalent provisions in the protocols . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	235	Article 1 of the Convention imposed on contracting states an obligation to secure to ` everyone within their jurisdiction ' the rights and freedoms defined in section 1 of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	236	In article 56 the Convention made provision for contracting states ' colonies and the like . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	237	These were described in article 56 -LRB- 1 -RRB- as ` territories for whose international relations -LSB- a state -RSB- is responsible ' : ` Any State may ... declare by notification addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe that the present Convention shall ... extend to all or any of the territories for whose international relations it is responsible . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	238	A similar power of extension appears in successive Protocols : see , for instance , article 4 of the first Protocol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	239	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	240	The Human Rights Act is a United Kingdom statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	241	The Act is expressed to apply to Northern Ireland : section 22 -LRB- 6 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	242	It is not expressed to apply elsewhere in any relevant respect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	243	What , then , of Convention obligations assumed by the United Kingdom in respect of its overseas territories by making a declaration under article 56 ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	244	In my view the rights brought home by the Act do not include Convention rights arising from these extended obligations assumed by the United Kingdom in respect of its overseas territories . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	245	I can see no warrant for interpreting the Act as having such an extended territorial reach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	246	If the United Kingdom notifies the Secretary General of the European Council that the Convention shall apply to one of its overseas territories , the United Kingdom thenceforth assumes in respect of that territory a treaty obligation in respect of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	247	But such a notification does not extend the reach of sections 6 and 7 of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	248	The position is the same in respect of protocols . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	249	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	250	The qualification just described is not in point in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	251	South Georgia is a territory for whose international relations the United Kingdom is responsible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	252	In respect of South Georgia the United Kingdom has made a declaration in respect of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	253	It has not made a similar declaration in respect of the first Protocol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	254	The territorial scope of the Convention 38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	255	The responsibility of contracting states under the Convention for acts done outside their boundaries arises in a variety of contexts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	256	The present case concerns , and concerns only , the responsibility of a contracting state for acts done in relation to a territory for whose international relations it is responsible but in respect of which the contracting state has not made a declaration under article 56 or the corresponding article in a protocol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	257	In this opinion I confine my remarks to this question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	258	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	259	I turn then to the Strasbourg jurisprudence on this question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	260	The question has been considered by the European Court of Human Rights and the Commission on several occasions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	261	Most relevant to the present case are two admissibility decisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	262	The case of Bui Van Thanh v United Kingdom -LRB- application no 16137/90 -RRB- concerned Vietnamese ` boat people ' who were refused entry to Hong Kong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	263	The applicants complained , among other matters , that their forcible return to Vietnam would be contrary to article 3 of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	264	At that time the United Kingdom was still responsible for the international relations of Hong Kong but it had made no declaration under article 56 in respect of Hong Kong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	265	The applicants said that , even so , the complaint was admissible because the policy of forcible repatriation of Vietnamese refugees was in reality a policy of the United Kingdom and the Hong Kong authorities exercised their functions on the basis of decisions taken in the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	266	The Commission rejected this submission : ` It is an essential part of the scheme of article -LSB- 56 -RSB- that a declaration extending the Convention to -LSB- a territory for whose international relations a contracting party is responsible -RSB- be made before the Convention applies either to acts of the dependent government or to policies formulated by the government of a contracting party in the exercise of its responsibilities in relation to such territory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	267	Accordingly , in the present case even if the Commission were to accept that the acts of the Hong Kong authorities were based on United Kingdom policy , it must find that it has no competence to examine the application since no declaration under article -LSB- 56 -RSB- has been made in respect of Hong Kong . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	268	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	269	This reasoning was adopted by the Court in Yonghong v Portugal , Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1999 - IX , p 385 , a case concerning the proposed extradition of Mr Yonghong from Macao to China to face criminal charges . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	270	The court recognised that ` jurisdiction ' under article 1 is not limited to the national territory of contracting states . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	271	Their responsibility can be involved because acts of their authorities produce effects outside their own territory : Drozd and Janousek v France and Spain -LRB- 1992 -RRB- 14 EHRR 745 , para 91 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	272	But article 1 of the Convention must be read in the light of article 56 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	273	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	274	The reasoning of these two decisions is clear and cogent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	275	In my view this reasoning leads ineluctably to the conclusion that Quark would have no standing to make a complaint in Strasbourg against the United Kingdom in respect of the impugned instruction given by the Secretary of State . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	276	There can be no rational distinction between the local government giving effect to policies of the contracting state , as in the Bui Van Thanh case , and the local government giving effect to a direction from the contracting state . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	277	In neither case is the responsibility of the contracting state under the Convention engaged in the absence of a declaration under article 56 or the relevant protocol in respect of the territory in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	278	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	279	Nor , in such cases , can the responsibility of the contracting state depend upon whether , in formulating its policies or deciding to give a binding direction , the contracting state government attached weight primarily or solely to the interests of the contracting state as distinct from the interests of its overseas territory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	280	These interests will often march hand-in-hand . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	281	Even where they do not , the liability of the contracting state under the Convention in cases of this type can not depend on political considerations or motivations of this character . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	282	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	283	In the present case the local government of South Georgia is comparatively undeveloped . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	284	It could hardly be otherwise , given there is no indigenous population and the inhabitants are largely confined to a handful of transient research scientists . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	285	But there is a genuine if simple form of local government , headed by a Commissioner having legislative and executive authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	286	He is resident in the Falklands Islands . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	287	The territory has its own laws . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	288	I can see no reason to suppose the European Court of Human Rights would disregard the existence of this governmental structure when considering the application of the Convention in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	289	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
269	290	This being the position under the Convention , it follows in my view there has been no violation of Quark 's Convention rights within the meaning of sections 6 and 7 of the Human Rights Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN

269	296	In my view this line of argument is misdirected in the present context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	297	In the present context this is a non-issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	298	Quark 's claim fails for a different reason . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	299	It fails because the Secretary of State 's instruction was not incompatible with a Convention right within the meaning of the Human Rights Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	300	Had the instruction been incompatible , the capacity in which the Secretary of State gave his instruction would not have afforded him a defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	301	Clearly , when he gave his instruction the Secretary of State was exercising the powers of the Crown under section 5 of the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands Order 1985 : ` The Commissioner ... shall do and execute all things that belong to his office according to such instructions , if any , as Her Majesty may from time to time see fit to give him through a Secretary of State ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	302	But characterising the instruction the Secretary of State gave in this case as an instruction issued by Her Majesty ` in right of South Georgia ' , as distinct from ` in right of the United Kingdom ' , leads nowhere . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	303	It does not provide an answer to the question raised in the present proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	304	Far from being an anterior question , in this context it is an irrelevant question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	305	It does not provide the answer , either way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	306	46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	307	Test the matter this way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	308	Suppose it were the case that the Strasbourg jurisprudence was to the opposite effect of what was decided in the Bui Van Thanh case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	309	Suppose it were the case that , under the Convention , a contracting state is liable for the consequences in a dependent state of an instruction given by it to the dependent government . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	310	If that were the law in respect of the Convention there could really be no doubt that sections 6 and 7 of the Human Rights Act would be applicable in the present case even though the Secretary of State was acting ` in right of ' South Georgia when giving the impugned instruction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	311	Otherwise the Act would fail to achieve its intended purpose of affording a domestic remedy matching the Strasbourg remedy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	312	47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	313	This example illustrates that , as I have said , what matters in the present case is not the capacity in which the Secretary of State gave his instruction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	314	What matters is whether his instruction violated a Convention right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	315	In the Act the undefined expression ` public authority ' is , in short , a reference to those bodies for whose acts or omissions the United Kingdom is answerable before the European Court of Human Rights : see the Aston Cantlow case -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 1 AC 546 , 554 , para 6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	316	If the Secretary of State 's instruction was incompatible with a Convention right and the United Kingdom was therefore liable under the Convention , the Secretary of State would be liable accordingly under the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	317	He would be liable as a public authority even though he was acting in right of South Georgia . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	318	48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	319	I recognise of course that in other contexts , that is , contexts other than the scope of the Human Rights Act , the capacity in which a minister of the Crown was acting may be all-important . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	320	An instance of this can be found in R v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs , Ex p Indian Association of Alberta -LSB- 1982 -RSB- QB 892 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	321	There the issue was whether the obligations of the Crown to the Indian peoples of Canada were obligations of the Crown in right of Canada or obligations in right of the United Kingdom and as such a liability ` in respect of Her Majesty 's Government in the United Kingdom ' within section 40 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	322	In contexts such as these it may be necessary to characterise , for this or that purpose , the capacity in which the Crown acted in a particular transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	323	But in the present case that is not so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	324	For this reason I would set aside the declaration made by the Court of Appeal , and in that respect allow the appeal of the Secretary of State , but not substitute any other form of declaration . 	lord nicholls	self	outcome	0.5	NAN

269	353	After their success in the Court of Appeal , Quark made a claim against the Secretary of State for damages for breach of section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Human Rights Act 1998 , which provides that it is unlawful for a `` public authority '' to act in a way which is incompatible with Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	354	Quark claim that in giving the instruction under section 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Order , the Secretary of State acted as a public authority and that his action was incompatible with Quark 's Convention right under article 1 of Protocol 1 to the peaceful enjoyment of its possessions , which are alleged to include the legitimate expectation of being given a licence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
269	355	56 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	356	The Secretary of State applied to strike out the claim on two grounds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	357	First , he said that Quark had no Convention rights as defined in the 1998 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	358	`` Convention rights '' mean rights under the Convention `` as it has effect for the time being in relation to the United Kingdom '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	359	It does not include such Convention rights , if any , as may exist under the law of SGSSI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	360	As it happens , there are no Convention rights in the domestic law of SGSSI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	361	The United Kingdom has by a declaration under article 56 of the Convention extended its application to SGSSI but , for two reasons , that is no help to Quark . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	362	One is that the declaration operates only in international law the other is that the extension does not include Protocol 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	363	57 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	364	Secondly the Secretary of State says that in giving the instruction , he did not act as a public authority for the purposes of section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	365	The 1998 Act is United Kingdom legislation ; it does not purport to have extra-territorial application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	366	A `` public authority '' is defined to include `` any person certain of whose functions are functions of a public nature '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	367	That must mean United Kingdom functions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	368	In giving the instruction under section 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Order , the Secretary of State was acting on behalf of Her Majesty exercising Her powers as sovereign of SGSSI , not the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	369	58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	370	In my opinion these objections are unanswerable but I must consider how Mr Vaughan QC , who appeared for Quark , tried to answer them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	371	First , he said although the `` possessions '' which he claims the right to enjoy were in SGSSI , the Secretary of State interfered with them by an act done in the United Kingdom , namely the despatch of the instruction to the Commissioner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	372	Mr Vaughan submitted that the Convention , even as it has effect in relation to the United Kingdom , can have an extra-territorial application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	373	An act done by a public authority in the United Kingdom which interfered with property rights in another country could be a breach of convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	374	59 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	375	There are cases in Strasbourg which support the proposition that the Convention can have an exceptional extra-territorial application when authorised agents of a Member State are exercising authority over persons or property outside its territory : for a recent discussion of this doctrine , see the judgment of the Court of Appeal in R -LRB- B -RRB- v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs -LSB- 2005 -RSB- 2 WLR 618 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	376	Thus the Convention may have extra-territorial application to persons or property within an area under military occupation by a Member State -LRB- Cyprus v Turkey -LRB- 2001 -RRB- 35 EHRR 731 -RRB- or in its embassy in a foreign country -LRB- M v Denmark -LRB- 1992 -RRB- 73 DR 193 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	377	But the present case comes nowhere near falling within such an exceptional category . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	378	The United Kingdom government exercises no authority over the waters of SGSSI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	379	That authority is vested in the Commissioner and the Director . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	380	60 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	381	Mr Vaughan 's argument is that as a matter of real politik , the United Kingdom is able , through the powers reserved to Her Majesty and exercisable on the advice of the Secretary of State , to impose its authority on SGSSI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	382	But the Strasbourg jurisprudence says clearly that this is not a sufficient ground for giving the Convention extra-territorial application to dependent territories outside the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	383	To do so would be inconsistent with the scheme of article 56 of the Convention , which provides that a State may declare that the Convention shall extend to `` all or any of the territories for whose international relations it is responsible '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	384	If there is no such declaration , then the Convention does not so extend . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	385	It would not be consistent to hold that , merely because the territory was dependent on the United Kingdom and its government could exercise reserved powers , the Convention 's application to the United Kingdom extended extra-territorially to acts done under the law of that territory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	386	61 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	387	So , for example , in Gillow v United Kingdom -LRB- 1986 -RRB- 11 EHRR 335 the applicants complained of an infringement of their rights under article 1 of Protocol 1 when the housing authority in Guernsey refused to allow them to occupy the house they owned there . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	388	The United Kingdom had not made a declaration extending the Protocol to Guernsey and the Court held that it had no jurisdiction to deal with the complaint . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	389	In Bui Van Thanh v United Kingdom -LRB- 1990 -RRB- -LRB- Application No 16137/90 -RRB- the Commission reached a similar conclusion about a complaint of infringement of Convention rights by the government of Hong Kong , to which the Convention had not been extended at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	390	The applicant 's argument was similar to that of Mr Vaughan in this case : he said that the alleged infringing acts by the Hong Kong authorities had been `` based on United Kingdom policy '' and relied upon cases on extra-territoriality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	391	But the Commission rejected the argument , saying that it would conflict with an `` essential part of the scheme '' of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	392	62 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	393	The Court of Appeal decided that Quark could not complain of infringement of a Convention right because Protocol 1 had not been extended to SGSSI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	394	As Gillow v United Kingdom shows , that would have been the reasoning and conclusion if the case had been in Strasbourg . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	395	As a matter of international law , the Strasbourg court would have been concerned with whether the United Kingdom government had , by a declaration of extension under article 4 of Protocol 1 , applied the Convention to SGSSI and accepted responsibility for its infringement by the government of SGSSI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	396	But for the purposes of the 1998 Act , it does not matter whether the Protocol has been extended to SGSSI or not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	397	The Act is concerned only with the Convention as it applies to the United Kingdom and not by extension to other territories . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	398	63 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	399	Mr Vaughan 's answer to the Secretary of State 's other objection was much the same as the answer to the first . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	400	He said that although the acts of Her Majesty in respect of Her government of the SGSSI were in theory not acts of a United Kingdom public authority , Her instructions to the Commissioner in this case had been given on the advice of the Secretary of State and in what were perceived to be the interests of the United Kingdom in its diplomatic relations with other states fishing in Antarctic waters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	401	Therefore they were acts of the Secretary of State in his capacity as a United Kingdom public authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	402	64 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	403	This argument failed before Collins J but succeeded in the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	404	In my opinion Collins J was right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	405	The test for whether someone exercising statutory powers was exercising them as a United Kingdom public authority is in my opinion whether they were exercised under the law of the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	406	In this case they were not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	407	The acts of the Secretary of State in advising Her Majesty and communicating her instructions to the Commissioner had legal effect only by virtue of the Order , which is the constitution of SGSSI and not part of the law of the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	408	The court is neither concerned nor equipped to decide in whose interests the act was done . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	409	That this would also be the approach of the Strasbourg authorities is shown by the decision of the Commission in Bui Van Thanh v United Kingdom -LRB- 1990 -RRB- -LRB- Application No 16137/90 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	410	65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	411	It is not in my opinion inconsistent with this construction of the 1998 Act that the Secretary of State conceded the jurisdiction of the High Court to quash the instruction by judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	412	There is authority both ancient and modern for the High Court 's exercise of jurisdiction , first by prerogative writ and then by judicial review , over all Her Majesty 's territories : see R -LRB- Bancoult -RRB- v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs -LSB- 2001 -RSB- QB 1067 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	413	But that does not mean that the acts in question are acts of United Kingdom public authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	414	On the contrary , the jurisdiction exists whether the act is one of a United Kingdom public authority or not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	415	66 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
269	416	I would therefore allow the appeal of Secretary of State and -LRB- although for reasons not quite the same as those of the Court of Appeal -RRB- dismiss Quark 's cross-appeal . 	lord hoffmann	self	outcome	0.6	NAN

269	447	71 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	448	The first issue in this appeal is whether the Court of Appeal was correct to hold , as its declaration records , that the instruction of 7 June 2001 was issued by Her Majesty in right of the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	449	My noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill has described the statutory background in the light of which this instruction was issued through the Secretary of State to the Commissioner , and I gratefully adopt what he has said about this . 	lord hope	lord bingham	factagr	0.7	NAN
269	450	The question , in simple terms , is whether the instruction was issued by Her Majesty the Queen as Head of State of the United Kingdom -LRB- Mr Vaughan QC referred throughout his speech to Her Majesty as Queen of England , but the State of which she is the Head is the United Kingdom -RRB- or by Her Majesty the Queen as Head of State of SGSSI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	451	72 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	452	The starting point for an examination of this question , in my opinion , is the date of the coming into operation , on the date appointed for the coming into operation of the Constitution of the Falkland Islands , of the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands Order 1985 -LRB- `` the 1985 Order '' -RRB- which established a separate government for SGSSI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	453	Its government is , in a variety of ways , subordinate to the government of the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	454	But from this date forward SGSSI ceased to be a dependency of the Falkland Islands . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	455	It now has its own government . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	456	In Tito v Waddell -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 1977 -RSB- Ch 106 , 254 , the Vice-Chancellor -LRB- Sir Robert Megarry -RRB- said that a government did not cease to be a government because it was subordinate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	457	In R v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs , Ex p Indian Association of Alberta -LSB- 1982 -RSB- QB 892 , 927 , Kerr LJ emphasised that the question whether the situs of rights and obligations of the Crown is to be found in right , or in respect of , the United Kingdom or of other governments within the Commonwealth of which Her Majesty is Head of State has nothing to do with whether those governments are independent or not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	458	At p 927 he said : `` Indeed , independence , or the degree of independence , is wholly irrelevant to the issue , because it is clear that rights and obligations of the Crown will arise exclusively in right or respect of any government outside the bounds of the United Kingdom as soon as soon as it can be seen that there is an established government of the Crown in the overseas territory in question . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	459	73 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	460	The constitution of SGSSI is contained in the 1985 Order , as amended by the Order of 1995 -LRB- SI 1995/1621 -RRB- , and the powers and duties of the Commissioner are set out in section 5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	461	It provides that he is to have such powers and duties as are conferred or imposed upon him by or under the Order or any other law `` and such other powers and duties as Her Majesty may from time to time be pleased to assign to him ... '' The reference to Her Majesty in this part of this section is plainly a reference to Her Majesty as Head of State and Queen of SGSSI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	462	Mr Vaughan did not seek to suggest otherwise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	463	The section then provides as follows : '' ... and , subject to the provisions of this Order or of any other law by which any such powers or duties are conferred or imposed , shall do and execute all things that belong to his office according to such instructions , if any , as Her Majesty may from time to time see fit to give him through a Secretary of State . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	464	74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	465	It was the reference to a Secretary of State in these concluding words that led the Court of Appeal to accept Mr Vaughan 's argument that the instruction of 7 June 2001 was given by Her Majesty in right of the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	466	As Pill LJ , with whom Thomas and Jacob LJJ agreed , explained , the court approached the issue as one of construction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	467	He said that it was to be determined on a construction of the 1985 Order : -LSB- 2005 -RSB- QB 93 , 111 - 112 , paras 47-49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	468	Having construed the Order , his conclusion was that the instruction was given to the Commissioner by Her Majesty in right of the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	469	He explained his reasoning in this way : `` 48 Upon a consideration of the 1985 Order , that result appears to me to have been achieved in section 5 of the 1985 Order , and in other sections , in the context of the Order as a whole . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	470	A similar power is contained in sections 7 , 9 and 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	471	There is a very considerable reservation of powers to the Secretary of State . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	472	49 The Secretary of State identified in section 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and elsewhere in the Order is clearly Her Majesty 's Secretary of State in the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	473	An instruction of Her Majesty through a United Kingdom Secretary of State would , on the face of it , be expected to be an instruction of Her Majesty as Queen of the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	474	The Order appears to me to indicate in several sections an exercise of United Kingdom powers with respect to the governance of South Georgia . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	475	In para 50 he said that it would be an abject surrender of substance to form to treat the instruction given by the Secretary of State on behalf of Her Majesty as one given in right of South Georgia . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	476	75 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	477	In my opinion this construction places too much weight on the references in section 5 and elsewhere in the 1985 Order to the Secretary of State and too little weight on the references to Her Majesty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	478	And the conclusion that it led to overlooks the constitutional reality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	479	It was the constitution of SGSSI that provided the vehicle for the instruction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	480	And it was the constitution of SGSSI that established the legal framework within which the instruction was given and which required the Commissioner to give effect to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	481	76 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	482	If one approaches the 1985 Order , as one should , as an instrument which sets out the constitution of SGSSI , the references that it makes to Her Majesty fall to be read as references to Her Majesty in the exercise of her rights as Head of State and Queen of the territory unless that there is a clear indication to the contrary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
269	483	As I have already said , that is the meaning that one would give to the first reference that is made to Her Majesty in section 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	484	I can see no good reason for altering the meaning of the phrase when she is referred to again in the same subsection or elsewhere in the 1985 Order just because the references on these occasions are to her giving instructions through a Secretary of State . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	485	These references reflect the constitutional reality that the government of SGSSI is subordinate to that of the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	486	It is subject to instruction from time to time as to what it can and can not do . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	487	But the constitutional reality is that , although the government of SGSSI is a subordinate government , it is nevertheless the government of the territory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	488	The Secretary of State is not acting , when Her Majesty gives instructions under section 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , on behalf of Her Majesty as Head of State of the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	489	What he is doing is providing the vehicle by which , according to the constitution of SGSSI , instructions are given and other acts done by Her Majesty as its Head of State . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	490	77 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	491	Mr Vaughan accepted that section 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- was open to this interpretation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	492	But he submitted that the question was not simply how the 1985 Order ought to be construed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	493	It was , he said , necessary to look at the particular facts and circumstances and at the context in which the instruction was given to the Commissioner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	494	In this case the instruction was out of the ordinary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	495	It was clear from the correspondence that the factors on which it was based owed nothing to the local circumstances in South Georgia or elsewhere in SGSSI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	496	It had nothing to do with the population there , such as it was , or to local politics as they did not exist . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	497	The reasons of policy that lay behind it were founded exclusively on what was in the best interests of the United Kingdom 's foreign policy , not that of SGSSI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	498	78 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	499	If this approach was sound , it would mean that an examination would need to be undertaken in each case to determine in right of which of the various sovereign positions which she occupies the instruction was given by Her Majesty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	500	An instruction of the kind that was given in this case could have its origin in a variety of policy reasons or motives . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	501	Some of these might be said to be domestic to SGSSI and the maritime zone for which it is responsible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	502	Some might be said to be concerned with its external relations or with the external relations of other governments with legitimate interests in its territory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	503	Some might be said to be concerned exclusively with aspects of the United Kingdom 's foreign policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	504	An examination of the question where the balance lay , whether the interests were as clear cut as they were said to be and as to which of these interests , if any , was predominant would be something for which a court is not at all well suited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	505	I would not go so far as to say that the question was not justiciable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	506	But if it was open to a court to consider the question this could give rise to difficulty in predicting the consequences of the instruction and to a situation of great uncertainty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	507	I do not believe that the constitution was intended to work in that way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	508	79 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	509	But there is an underlying and , as I see it , an irremediable flaw in the argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	510	The reasons of policy that led to the giving of the instruction , or the motives that lay behind it , are irrelevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	511	The question is simply in what capacity was the instruction given by Her Majesty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	512	The constitutional machinery provides the answer to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	513	It was that machinery that was being used to give the instruction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	514	So it was in right of her position as Head of State of SGSSI that it was given by Her Majesty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	515	80 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	516	I would therefore allow the Secretary of State 's appeal and set aside the Court of Appeal 's declaration . 	lord hope	self	outcome	0.8	NAN
269	517	The second issue 81 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	518	The second issue in the appeal is whether the Court of Appeal was correct to conclude that the instruction was incapable of giving rise to a claim of damages under section 7 of the Human Rights Act 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	519	It assumes , as Mr Vaughan put it when he was presenting his oral argument , that this is a domestic case which raises the question whether the United Kingdom is answerable under the European Convention on Human Rights before the European Court in Strasbourg for acts done in the United Kingdom which have effects in a territory for whose external relations the United Kingdom is responsible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	520	He conceded that if the first issue was decided against it Quark could not on any view succeed in its claim for a remedy under the Human Rights Act , although he said that this would not prevent it from seeking a remedy in Strasbourg . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	521	82 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	522	Notwithstanding Mr Vaughan 's concession it is , I think , necessary to explain more fully why a decision against Quark on the first issue deprives it of the possibility of a remedy under the Human Rights Act 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	523	The point was fully argued on both sides , and it is a point of some general interest and importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	524	83 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	525	The Court of Appeal approached this issue on three assumptions : first , that the instruction was given in right of the United Kingdom , secondly , that it is arguable that there has been a breach of article 1 of the First Protocol and , thirdly , that the instruction has affected property rights in a British Overseas Territory to which the First Protocol has not been extended under article 4 of the Protocol : -LSB- 2005 -RSB- QB 93 , per Pill LJ at p 113 , para 52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	526	The first of these assumptions is no longer tenable in view of the answer that is to be given by the majority of your Lordships on the first issue . 	lord hope	lord nicholls	partagr	0.8	NAN
269	526	The first of these assumptions is no longer tenable in view of the answer that is to be given by the majority of your Lordships on the first issue . 	lord hope	lady hale	outcome	0.8	NAN
269	527	But the second and third assumptions remain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	528	Their importance is demonstrated by the Court of Appeal 's finding that the fact that the First Protocol has not been extended to SGSSI was fatal to Quark 's claim : per Pill LJ at p 114 , para 56 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	529	84 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	530	Mr Vaughan said that it was sufficient for Quark to succeed in Strasbourg that there was a decision taken or act done in the United Kingdom whose external effects were in violation of its right under article 1 of the First Protocol , and that this in its turn was sufficient for it to succeed in its claim under the Human Rights Act 1998 for a domestic remedy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	531	He submitted that it was not essential to his case that he should be able to show that the Secretary of State was acting in right of the United Kingdom when he was giving the instruction on behalf of Her Majesty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	532	While his primary case was that the Secretary of State was acting throughout in his capacity as a member of the United Kingdom government , the matter did not end there . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	533	He said that Quark could still maintain that the Secretary of State was acting to protect the interests of the United Kingdom rather than those of SGSSI and that , as a Secretary of State as part of the government of the United Kingdom is a public authority , he has acted here in a way that is made unlawful by section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1998 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	534	85 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	535	Section 6 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1998 Act does not attempt to provide an exhaustive definition of what is meant by the expression `` public authority '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	536	It proceeds on the basis that there are certain bodies that so obviously have the character of a public authority that it is not necessary to mention them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	537	These are bodies which , because of the governmental functions that they perform , are public authorities through and through and are , as it is sometimes put , `` core '' public authorities : see Aston Cantlow and Wilmcote with Billesley Parochial Church Council v Wallbank -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 1 AC 546 , paras 6-7 , 34-35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	538	It is plain that a Secretary of State , when performing the functions of his office , is a core public authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	539	Mr Vaughan 's alternative approach to Quark 's claim is based on the assertion that the Secretary of State was acting in the United Kingdom 's interests when he was giving the instruction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	540	I am far from being persuaded that this is a correct way of describing what he was doing under section 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1985 Order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	541	But it is difficult to separate out completely the functions that he performs for Her Majesty under the constitution of SGSSI , whose government is a subordinate one , from those that he performs as Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs in the government of the United Kingdom to which it is subordinate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	542	I am content to examine this issue on the assumption that we are dealing here with an act which was done by him , in part at least , in the United Kingdom in his capacity as a public authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	543	86 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	544	The critical question then is whether Quark can show that the act of which it complains was incompatible with any of its Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	545	The only Convention right that is in issue is the right to the protection of property under article 1 of the First Protocol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	546	So the question comes to be whether Quark can show that the right under article 1 of the First Protocol is one of the Convention rights within the meaning of section 6 of the 1998 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	547	This depends upon the proper interpretation of the 1998 Act , as Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said in In re McKerr -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 1 WLR 807 , para 25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
269	548	87 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	549	Section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1998 Act provides that the expression `` the Convention rights '' means the rights and fundamental freedoms set out in , among other articles , articles 1 to 3 of the First Protocol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	550	But section 7 -LRB- 1 -RRB- provides that a person may claim that a person has acted in a way that is made unlawful by section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- only if he is -LRB- or would be -RRB- a victim of the unlawful act , and section 7 -LRB- 7 -RRB- provides that , for the purposes of that section , a person is a victim of an unlawful act only if he would be a victim for the purposes of article 34 of the Convention if proceedings were brought in the European Court of Human Rights in respect of that right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	551	These provisions must be read in conjunction with the definition of the words `` the Convention '' in section 21 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , which is in these terms : '' ` the Convention ' means the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms , agreed by the Council of Europe at Rome on 4 November 1950 as it has effect for the time being in relation to the United Kingdom . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	552	The words `` as it has effect for the time being in relation to the United Kingdom '' do not appear in the definition of the words `` the First Protocol '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	553	But article 4 of the First Protocol provides that a declaration made in accordance with that article shall be deemed to have been made in accordance with article 56 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Convention , and article 5 provides that the provisions of articles 1 , 2 and 3 and 4 shall be regarded as additional articles of the Convention and that all the provisions of the Convention shall apply accordingly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	554	The qualification that is added to the definition of `` the Convention '' applies , by implication , equally to the definition of the First Protocol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	555	88 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	556	These provisions show that a person can not claim that an act of a public authority is made unlawful by section 6 of the 1998 Act unless the Convention right is one for which the United Kingdom would be answerable in Strasbourg . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	557	Article 1 of the Convention provides that the High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone `` within their jurisdiction '' the rights and freedoms defined in section 1 of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	558	Article 56 of the Convention provides that any State may declare by notification addressed to the Council of Europe 's Secretary General that it is to extend to all or any of the territories for whose international relations it is responsible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	559	A separate notification is needed under article 4 of the First Protocol to extend the provisions of the Protocol to those territories . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	560	The Convention was extended to the Falkland Islands and its dependencies on 23 October 1953 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	561	But the First Protocol was not extended to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	562	So SGSSI is not one of the territories for which the United Kingdom is answerable in Strasbourg for a breach of article 1 of the First Protocol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	563	Quark could not claim in Strasbourg that , because of the effects of the Secretary of State 's act on its property rights in SGSSI , it was a victim of a breach of that article . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	564	It follows that it can not claim in domestic law that it was the victim of an act of a public authority made unlawful by section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1998 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	565	89 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	566	Mr Vaughan then said that it would be enough for him in Strasbourg to show that an act was done in the United Kingdom which had external effects in a way that violated article 1 of the First Protocol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	567	It is indeed the case that the jurisdiction of the European Court is not limited to the national territory of the High Contracting Parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	568	In Drozd and Janousek v France and Spain -LRB- 1992 -RRB- 14 EHRR 745 , para 91 , the Court said that their responsibility can be involved because of acts of their authorities producing effects outside their own territory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	569	But in Bankovic v Belgium -LRB- 2001 -RRB- 11 BHRC 435 , para 80 , the Court made it clear that , subject to article 56 , the Convention was essentially territorial in its application and that it was not designed to be applied throughout the world , even in respect of the conduct of contracting states . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	570	Its jurisprudence shows that the scope of the obligations under the Convention of a contracting state in relation to a territory for whose international relations it is responsible has always depended on notification under article 56 or , as the case may be , under article 4 of the First Protocol .

269	573	The Commission said at p 268 that the specific object of article 63 -LRB- now article 56 -RRB- of the Convention and article 4 of the First Protocol was to lay down for everyone the territorial field of application of the two instruments , and that this part of the complaint did not come within the competence of the Commission ratione loci .

269	574	In Gillow v United Kingdom -LRB- 1986 -RRB- 11 EHRR 335 the applicants who owned a house in Guernsey were refused permission to occupy it under a law which restricted the right of residence there so they claimed that there had been a violation of their rights under article 1 of the First Protocol .

269	578	Accordingly , in the present case even if the Commission were to accept that the acts of the Hong Kong authorities were based on United Kingdom policy , it must find that it has no competence to examine the application since no declaration under article 63 -LRB- 1 -RRB- has been made in respect of Hong Kong . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	579	91 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	580	A declaration in similar terms is to be found in the Court 's decision in Yonghong v Portugal , Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1999 - IX , pp 385 , 392 , where the issue was whether the applicant 's extradition from Macao to China was a violation by Portugal in Macao of his Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	581	Its decision in Soering v United Kingdom -LRB- 1989 -RRB- 11 EHRR 439 is not incompatible with the territorial principle that this line of authority demonstrates , as the applicant was still in the territory of the contracting state and his complaint was of what might happen to him if he was removed by the contracting state from its own territory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	582	On these authorities the conclusion that I would reach is that this alternative argument would not succeed in Strasbourg . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	583	92 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	584	It is plain from the definition of `` the Convention '' in section 21 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1998 Act , which limits the scope of that expression to the Convention as it has effect for the time being in relation to the United Kingdom , that the scope of the liability of public authorities for acts made unlawful by section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- having effects in a territory for whose international relations the United Kingdom is responsible depends on notification under article 56 of the Convention and article 4 of the First Protocol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	585	It is not the purpose of the 1998 Act to impose liability on a public authority where the complaint would not be within the jurisdiction of the European Court in Strasbourg . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	586	Despite Mr Vaughan 's persuasive submissions to the contrary , I see no escape from the conclusion that , even if he had succeeded on the first issue , it would not have been open to Quark to claim that it was the victim of an act that was made unlawful by section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1998 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	587	93 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	588	For these reasons , and for those given by my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in his discussion of this issue with which I am in full agreement , I would hold the instruction of 7 June 2001 is incapable of giving rise to a claim of damages under section 7 of the Human Rights Act 1998 . 	lord hope	lord nicholls	fullagr	0.9	NAN

269	595	A British career diplomat , for the time being Governor of the Falklands Islands and Commissioner for South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands , would be minded to grant a licence to a company registered in the Falkland Islands to continue to fish for Patagonian toothfish in the territorial waters of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	596	He knows that there was local discontent when the Islands ceased to be a Falkland Islands dependency following the 1982 war to regain the Falkland Islands from Argentina . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	597	He wishes to take into account the company 's loyalty to the fishery as well as local sensitivities in granting the company a licence to fish . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	598	But he is instructed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London not to grant the licence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	599	The Foreign Office is relying instead on more strategic concerns for the management of fish stocks in the region and the maintenance of good relations with the other States which have interests there . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	600	South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands have no permanent inhabitants other than the wildlife . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	601	They would probably not need a government at all were it not for the valuable fishing rights which surround them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	602	Their government consists of the Commissioner and the Director of Fisheries , both of whom have other jobs in the Falklands Islands , and will no doubt go on to other jobs for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in years to come . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	603	The Secretary of State who advises Her Majesty on the exercise of her powers in relation to the Islands is the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs in the government of the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	604	The legality of his actions can be challenged in the courts of the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	605	To the extent that he is in any way democratically accountable for the instructions which he advises Her Majesty to give to the Commissioner , it is to the Parliament of the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	606	95 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	607	In those circumstances , to maintain the strict separation between Her Majesty as Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Her Majesty as Queen of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands does indeed , as the Court of Appeal said , look like the `` abject surrender of substance to form '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	608	I recognise that imperial law has had to draw that distinction , at least since the colonies began to attain full independence in the latter half of the 19th century . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	609	But , despite what was said by Kerr LJ in R v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs , Ex p Indian Association of Alberta -LSB- 1982 -RSB- QB 892 , 927 , the distinction may have less validity in the case of territories which are in reality governed by and from the United Kingdom .

269	610	The few modern authorities relied upon by the Secretary of State could be distinguished . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	611	The passport granted by the Governor of Mauritius in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex p Bhurosah -LSB- 1968 -RSB- 1 QB 266 clearly did not fall within the definition of a United Kingdom passport in section 1 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
269	612	The act complained of in Tito v Waddell -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 1977 -RSB- Ch 106 was the act of the local official , whereas the act complained of here is the act of the Secretary of State . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	613	While I see the force of the imperial constitutional argument , therefore , I would prefer to decide this case on the basis of whether the Human Rights Act 1998 affords a remedy on these facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	614	96 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	615	The fact that our courts were able to strike down the Secretary of State 's instruction as wrong in law is not enough . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	616	Our law does not recognise a right to claim damages for losses caused by unlawful administrative action -LRB- although compensation may sometimes be available to the victims of maladministration -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	617	There has to be a distinct cause of action in tort or under the Human Rights Act 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	618	No-one suggests that there is an action in tort here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	619	The question is whether a claim for damages may be made under the Human Rights Act 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	620	Under section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of that Act it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	621	Under section 8 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act the court may grant such relief or remedy , or make such order , within its powers as it considers just and appropriate in relation to any act of a public authority which the court finds unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	622	There is , for the reasons already given , a respectable argument that the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs , when advising Her Majesty on the conduct of government in South Georgia , is not a public authority within the meaning of the 1998 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	623	97 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	624	But there is an even stronger argument that the Convention rights covered by section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- do not include the rights which Quark are claiming here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	625	By section 1 of the 1998 Act , the Convention rights mean the rights and fundamental freedoms set out in the listed articles of the Convention and its First and Sixth Protocols . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	626	But by section 21 -LRB- 1 -RRB- `` the Convention '' means the `` Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as it has effect for the time being in relation to the United Kingdom '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	627	The Convention itself , in article 56 and in article 4 of the First Protocol , contemplates that Member States will have a choice about extending the effect of the Convention to territories which are not part of the territory of the Member State but for whose foreign relations the Member State is responsible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	628	The United Kingdom extended the Convention to the Falkland Islands and its dependencies but neglected to extend the First Protocol to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	629	We have no idea whether this was deliberate or an oversight . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	630	But the fact remains that the First Protocol does not have `` effect in relation to the United Kingdom '' in respect of the deprivation of possessions in South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	631	The choice permitted to Member States by article 4 of the First Protocol would be meaningless if it did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	632	98 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	633	For that reason alone , I would hold that Quark do not have a right to claim damages under the 1998 Act in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	634	We are told that if they lose in the courts of the United Kingdom , they plan to apply to the European Court of Human Rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	635	I have a great deal of sympathy for Quark and the way in which they have been treated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	636	But I find it difficult to understand how they can succeed there in vindicating a right which has not been extended to the territory in which the right -LRB- if right there be -RRB- has been violated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	637	I would prefer to leave open what the position might be if the violated right were one which had been extended to South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands , such as the right not to be tortured or deprived of one 's liberty save in accordance with article 5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	638	The domestic law of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands would supply a remedy for breaches of the Convention rights which are also breaches of the common law -LRB- and perhaps the revenue from fishing licences would be enough to pay the damages -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	639	There would also be a remedy in Strasbourg should that domestic law be insufficient to protect those Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	640	But both of these might be hollow victories . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	641	If the real culprit were to be the government of the United Kingdom , I would prefer to keep an open mind about whether there might also be a real remedy here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	642	99 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
269	643	It follows that I would take the course proposed by my noble and learned friend , Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead , and for much the same reasons as his . 	lady hale	lord nicholls	fullagr	1	NAN
