124	14	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
124	15	Notwithstanding the careful reasoning contained in their speeches , I have come to the conclusion that they attach less significance than they should to the special position of a supply of an interest in land , such as the grant of a lease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
124	16	Subject to exceptions which need not concern us , such a supply can be an exempt supply or , if a taxable person elects to waive the exemption under Group 1 of Schedule 9 to the Value Added Tax Act 1994 -LRB- `` the 1994 Act '' -RRB- it can be a taxable supply if regulation 109 of the Value Added Tax Regulations 1995 -LRB- SI 1995/2518 -RRB- -LRB- `` the Regulations '' -RRB- is complied with . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
124	17	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
124	18	The language of regulation 109 is central to the outcome of this appeal as the Commissioners in their case contend . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
124	19	Regulation 109 is in the following terms : -LRB- 1 -RRB- This regulation applies where a taxable person has incurred an amount of input tax which has not been attributed to taxable supplies because he intended to use the goods or services in making either - -LRB- a -RRB- exempt supplies , or -LRB- b -RRB- both taxable and exempt supplies , and during a period of six years commencing on the first day of the prescribed accounting period in which the attribution was determined and before that intention is fulfilled , he uses or forms an intention to use the goods or services concerned in making taxable supplies or , in the case of an attribution within sub-paragraph -LRB- a -RRB- above , in making both taxable and exempt supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
124	20	-LRB- 2 -RRB- Subject to regulation 110 and where this regulation applies , the Commissioners shall , on receipt of an application made by the taxable person in such form and manner and containing such particulars as they may direct , pay to him an amount equal to the input tax which has become attributable to taxable supplies in accordance with the method which he was required to use when the input tax was first attributed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
124	21	-LRB- 3 -RRB- For the purposes of this regulation any question as to the nature of any supply shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Act and any Regulations or Orders made thereunder in force at the time when the input tax was first attributed . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
124	22	-LRB- Emphasis added -RRB- 5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
124	23	Regulation 109 is the converse of regulation 108 but it is not necessary to cite the terms of that regulation , although its presence should not be ignored since it is obviously intended that the choice to which I will refer operates in both directions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
124	24	The important feature of regulation 109 is that it gives the taxable person six years in which to elect to use or form an intention to use the goods or services concerned in making taxable supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
124	25	Examining the language of regulation 109 , which is all important to the outcome of this appeal , more closely it appears that there are contained in the regulation the following relevant requirements : -LRB- i -RRB- The taxable person must have incurred an amount of input tax -LRB- on supplies to him -RRB- which has not been attributed to taxable supplies -LRB- by him -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
124	26	-LRB- ii -RRB- This must be because he had intended for a period of time to use the goods and services -LRB- and the leasing of land is a supply of goods -RRB- in making exempt supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
124	27	-LRB- iii -RRB- Before he had fulfilled his intention to use the goods and services in making exempt supplies -LRB- ie `` before that intention is fulfilled '' -RRB- he must use or form the intention to use the goods or services in making taxable supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
124	28	-LRB- iv -RRB- That the change of intention happened during a period of six years commencing on the first day of the prescribed accounting period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	29	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	30	Having referred to regulation 109 , it is necessary to apply that regulation to the facts of the present appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	31	As they have been referred to by my Lords and in the reported decisions of the court and the tribunal below , it is sufficient for my purposes merely to refer to the fact that the Royal and Sun Alliance Insurance Group Plc -LRB- `` RSA '' -RRB- had leased accommodation from landlords who had exercised their option to treat the supply as taxable with the result that RSA had to pay input tax in relation to the letting and other services with which they were supplied . 	lord woolf	all	partagr	0.1	NAN
124	32	Between November 1991 and April 1993 RSA had five properties which became surplus to the requirements of their insurance business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	33	However , having decided to let the properties they had difficulty in obtaining tenants and the accommodation remained vacant for a substantial period of time -LRB- with exceptions which can be ignored -RRB- until November 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	34	On 21 November 1995 RSA made an election to waive the exemption and , accordingly , the supplies constituted by their lettings were a taxable supply in relation to which RSA charged output tax . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	35	The election was duly notified to the Commissioners on 21 December 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	36	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	37	During the intervening vacant period RSA continued to pay input tax on the rent and other services which RSA paid in order to retain their interest in the premises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	38	They also incurred expenses which would have been taxable in their attempts to let the premises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	39	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	40	It is not in dispute that if RSA had at the outset elected -LRB- that is , prior to the relevant dates between November 1991 and April 1993 -RRB- to treat the lettings as taxable supplies , RSA would have been entitled to credit for the input tax which is now in dispute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	41	RSA would have been entitled to this notwithstanding that the lettings did not take place in fact until after November 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	42	However , not having elected RSA did not seek credit for the input tax that was paid from time to time until they made their elections . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	43	So the input tax paid did not appear in their periodic VAT returns prior to their making the relevant elections . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	44	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	45	Until a landlord has identified the tenant to whom he is going to let premises , frequently it will not make sense to decide whether the letting should or should not be exempt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	46	What the decision should be will depend on the circumstances of the tenant in relation to VAT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	47	If the tenant can not obtain credit for any input tax payable it will be to the tenant 's disadvantage if the lease is a taxable supply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	48	Accordingly he may be prepared only to pay a lower rent then he would be prepared to pay if the letting was exempt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	49	For this reason , it can be sensible for a landlord -LRB- here RSA -RRB- to defer an election since once he elects he can not revoke that election . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	50	However , until he elects he is not entitled to credit for the input tax which he has paid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	51	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	52	If RSA 's submissions are correct , one of the purposes of regulation 109 is to take into account the difficulty of the landlord in this regard . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	53	However , if a landlord is to have the benefit of regulation 109 he must comply with its requirements . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	54	Here there is no dispute that the election was made during the period specified by the regulation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	55	Nor until RSA elected had the input tax , which they had paid , been attributed to taxable supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	56	The input tax could not be attributed because there had been no subletting of the premises and in any event , until RSA did elect , for VAT purposes , the only supplies that RSA could make were exempt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	57	While , if RSA had let the premises before electing they would have made an exempt supply , as the letting followed the election there was no exempt supply to which the input tax could be related . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	58	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	59	Once RSA had decided to let the premises as a taxable supply , the position changed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	60	RSA , applying the language of regulation 109 literally , were fulfilling the remaining requirement of that regulation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	61	RSA was a taxable person that had incurred an amount of tax on the lettings of the properties to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	62	The amount of input tax had not been attributed to taxable supplies by them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	63	This was because they are deemed , not having elected , to have intended to make exempt supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	64	However , before they had fulfilled their intention to make the exempt supplies , that is by subletting the premises , RSA had elected to make taxable supplies instead by subletting the premises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	65	Throughout the economic activity remained the same but its taxable nature changed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	66	Finally that change of intention had occurred within the six year period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	67	That being so , I ask rhetorically why should RSA not be entitled to the benefit of regulation 109 ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	68	This is not a case , as has been suggested , of RSA rewriting history other than the rewriting that the regulation expressly contemplated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	69	If the regulation could not be applied in these circumstances it could not have any meaningful application to the subletting of property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	70	The Commissioners contend that inputs can be consumed by an unsuccessful attempt to make supplies and that the input tax incurred was so used here during the vacant period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	71	But this argument which has no statutory foundation is inconsistent with the express terms of regulation 109 , which presupposes that there will be a six year period in which to make an election and after that election there can be a claim for repayment of the tax paid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	72	This is because that tax -LRB- in the language of regulation 109 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -RRB- `` has become attributable to taxable supplies '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	73	Such attribution accords with article 20 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Sixth Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	74	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	75	The Commissioners give a description of a situation where they submit the option that the regulation is intended to provide would be lost . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	76	They submit that if a lawyer offers financial services at one time but having failed to obtain any customers the lawyer starts a new business offering legal services then the input tax paid for supplies to the first business would no longer be available and can not be set off against input tax payable by the second business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	77	I fully accept input tax incurred in relation to one business could not be set off against input tax payable in relation to a different business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	78	There is then no connection direct or otherwise between the supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	79	But that is an entirely different situation from the present . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	80	Here , throughout RSA were intending to make the same supply ; the only matter that was deferred was the decision as to whether to elect that that supply should be taxable , a situation which regulation 109 is , as it seems to me , directly designed to deal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	81	Throughout RSA were intending to make the same supply namely a subletting of the premises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
124	82	Before the election that would have been an exempt supply ; after the election it would be a taxable supply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	83	To make the taxable supply that RSA actually made it had no choice but to comply with the terms of the lease under which it was entitled to sublet the premises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	84	This involved paying rent including the input tax . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	85	It could not claim repayment of the input tax until it elected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	86	After it elected the accounting periods would be different in relation to the input tax that RSA had paid prior to election and the output tax RSA in due course received . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	87	However , while a taxable person is required to account periodically , as regulation 109 -LRB- 2 -RRB- itself anticipates , the taxable position over different accounting periods can change so that tax which was not repayable becomes payable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	88	Accounting periods can not be allowed to control what tax is payable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	89	The accounting periods are the tail not the dog . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	90	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	91	My noble and learned friend , Lord Walker , comes to the same conclusion as Lord Hoffmann that regulation 109 is not applicable because of the legislative framework as a whole including the Sixth Directive , and in particular , section 6 -LRB- 14 -RRB- of the 1994 Act and the language of regulation 85 which he regards -LRB- as did Arden LJ in the court below -RRB- as being ultimately decisive . 	lord woolf	lord walker	partagr	0.2	NAN

124	93	Section 6 of the 1994 Act sets out rules in relation to the time at which a supply of goods or services is to be treated as being made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	94	Section 6 -LRB- 14 -RRB- in particular provides , so far as relevant , as follows : `` The Commissioners may by regulations make provision with respect to the time at which a supply is to be treated as taking place in cases where - -LRB- a -RRB- it is a supply of goods or services for a consideration the whole or part of which is determined or payable periodically , or from time to time , or at the end of any period , or and for any such case as is mentioned in this subsection the regulations may provide for goods or services to be treated as separately and successively supplied at prescribed times or intervals . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	95	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	96	Regulation 85 so far as is relevant , is in the following terms : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Subject to paragraph -LRB- 2 -RRB- below , where the grant of a tenancy or lease is a supply of goods by virtue of paragraph 4 of Schedule 4 to the Act , and the whole or part of the consideration for that grant is payable periodically or from time to time , goods shall be treated as separately and successively supplied at the earlier of the following times - -LRB- a -RRB- each time that a part of the consideration is received by the supplier , or -LRB- b -RRB- each time that the supplier issues a VAT invoice relating to the grant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	97	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	98	Section 6 is necessary to determine when tax is to be payable or repayable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	99	Section 6 is not concerned with whether tax is payable or repayable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	100	Section 6 applies in exactly the same way whether a supply is taxable or not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	101	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	102	I accept that the right approach under section 6 and regulation 85 to both the lettings to and by RSA is to treat them as a series of separate supplies for accounting purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	103	However , Arden LJ , in the court below , goes further and says that section 6 and regulation 85 could affect the quantum of tax payable or repayable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	104	No authority supports such a proposition and its doubtful nature is highlighted by the fact that it would mean that the fiscal consequence could differ if the rent was payable quarterly or annually if an election was made during a year of the tenancy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	105	Furthermore , if her reasoning is correct I can not understand why it could not apply so as to prevent RSA even being able to take credit for output tax paid after election for quarters prior to RSA subletting the premises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	106	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	107	Reading section 6 -LRB- 14 -RRB- , regulation 85 and regulation 109 -LRB- 1 -RRB- together , I do not find any reason to read regulation 109 other than in accordance with its ordinary meaning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	108	Whereas , but for regulation 109 -LRB- 1 -RRB- it would not be possible for RSA , in about November 1995 , to form an intention to deduct or reclaim the input tax incurred in relation to periods prior to November 1995 , in respect of supplies after November 1995 that is what regulation 109 makes possible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	109	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	110	I fully accept the importance of regulation 85 in establishing the time of supply where there is grant of a tenancy or a lease but it can not apply where there has been no supply by RSA and therefore no consideration payable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	111	Here the issue is not when the supplies were made to and by RSA , this is not in dispute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	112	Where there is a special provision , such as that contained in regulation 109 , it must be given effect unless there is good reason for not doing so and regulation 85 provides no such obstacle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	113	As Svenska International plc v Customs and Excise Commissioners -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 1 WLR 769 , when there are supplies effect must be given to the time of supply rules , but this can not be done where there is no more than intention to make a supply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	114	The same reasoning applies to the passage of Lord Hoffmann 's speech in Customs and Excise Commissioners v Thorn Materials Supply Ltd -LSB- 1998 -RSB- 1 WLR 1106 , 1118 F - 1119 E ; -LSB- 1998 -RSB- STC 725 , 738 a-g . 	lord woolf	lord hoffmann	partagr	0.2	NAN

124	125	In 1993 the Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Group plc -LRB- `` RSA '' -RRB- decided to dispose of five of its leasehold properties which had become surplus to needs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	126	It advertised for sub-tenants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	127	But the market was weak and it did not succeed in sub-letting any of the properties until after 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	128	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	129	This appeal concerns the VAT which RSA was charged by its landlords on the rent and service charges payable during part of the period while the properties were empty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	130	For the purposes of VAT , the grant of a lease of land is a supply of goods or services , depending upon the length of the lease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	131	For present purposes the distinction does not matter ; the grant of any interest in land is an exempt supply -LRB- of goods or services -RRB- unless the landlord has elected to waive the exemption : see Value Added Tax Act 1994 , Sched 9 , Group 1 , para 1 and Sched 10 , paras 2 and 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	132	The landlords of the properties held by RSA had so elected and therefore both the leases and the services provided to RSA were taxable supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	133	So the landlords added VAT to their rent and service charge invoices . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	134	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	135	RSA made no similar election when it first tried to sub-let the properties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	136	It wanted to keep its options open . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
124	137	It thought that although tenants who carried on businesses making taxable supplies would find a taxable lease more attractive -LRB- because they could deduct the VAT -RRB- , tenants who made exempt supplies might prefer an exempt lease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	138	An election would be irrevocable -LRB- para 3 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of Sched 10 -RRB- and foreclose RSA 's options . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	139	On the other hand , until RSA actually elected , it was unable to say that it intended to use the goods or services supplied under the leases to make taxable supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	140	So it had to bear the input tax without deduction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	141	Eventually RSA elected for taxation with effect from 21 November 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

124	146	The Commissioners rejected the application and the Value Added Tax and Duties Tribunal -LRB- Mr David Demack -RRB- upheld their rejection on the ground that there was no `` direct and immediate link '' between the taxable goods and services supplied to RSA during the vacant unelected period and the taxable supplies it formed the intention of making after that period had ended : -LSB- 1999 -RSB- V & DR 336 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	147	On appeal to the High Court , Park J -LSB- 2000 -RSB- STC 933 disagreed , holding that there was such a link because the supplies to RSA during the vacant unelected period were supplies of the same leasehold property as it intended to sub-let after 21 November 1995 as a taxable supply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	148	The Court of Appeal , by a majority -LRB- Aldous and Sedley LJJ ; Arden LJ dissenting -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- STC 1476 upheld this decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	149	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	150	Regulation 109 -LRB- and its mirror image , regulation 108 , which deals with adjustments in favour of the Commissioners -RRB- give effect to article 20 of the Sixth Directive -LRB- 77/388/EEC -RRB- which provides that `` the initial deduction shall be adjusted according to the procedures laid down by the Member States '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	151	It is not suggested that the regulations do not conform to the Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	152	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	153	Two points about the regulations should be noted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	154	First , they require that the taxpayer should have first had one intention about the use he proposes to make of goods or services supplied to him and that he should afterwards use them for a different purpose or form an intention to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	155	In the case of regulation 109 , the first intention must be to use them for supplying exempt services or a mixture of exempt and taxable services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	156	The subsequent use , or intention , must be to supply taxable services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	157	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	158	In the present case , there is no question of an initial intention to use the inputs relating to the leases in supplying a mixture of services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	159	RSA 's general insurance business involved supplying a mixture of exempt and taxable services , but each lease was intended to be used in supplying either an exempt sub-lease or -LRB- after an election -RRB- a taxable sub-lease ; one or the other , but not both . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	160	In order to come within regulation 109 , therefore , RSA must have first had an intention to use the inputs in supplying exempt sub-leases and then used them , or formed an intention to use them , in supplying taxable sub-leases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	161	And that is what RSA says it did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	162	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	163	I mention this point because occasionally , for the purposes of other arguments , RSA stresses that it was never committed to supplying exempt leases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	164	It simply wanted to find tenants and was willing to fall in with whatever VAT arrangements suited them best . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	165	But these ambiguities are not consistent with a claim under regulation 109 , which is predicated upon a definite intention to make exempt supplies followed by a change of plan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	166	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	167	The second point is that the change of plan must have been in relation to particular goods or services supplied to RSA . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	168	The regulation says that it must have intended to use `` the goods or services '' in making exempt supplies and then used or formed an intention to use `` the goods or services concerned '' in making taxable supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	169	That may seem obvious , but needs to be borne in mind when one considers supplies of a uniform nature made on a continuous basis , like electricity or the use of a telephone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	170	Take , for example , a lawyer who thinks he can do better offering financial services -LRB- which are exempt -RRB- rather than legal services -LRB- taxable -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	171	He subscribes for telephone , fax and computer lines for use in his financial service business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	172	Because he is supplying exempt services , the input tax charged by the telephone company is not deductible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	173	But the business is a failure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	174	So he decides to offer legal services after all and continues to subscribe for the same telephone , fax and computer lines . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	175	From the time he starts his new business , he can deduct and , if necessary , claim repayment of input tax which he is charged on the telephone services he is receiving . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	176	But he can not form a new intention about the services supplied for the purposes of his old business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	177	They were different services which have already been used . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	178	So his decision to make taxable services instead of exempt services does not enable him to make a claim under regulation 109 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	179	The services used or intended to be used for making taxable outputs are not the services which were previously intended to be used for making exempt outputs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	180	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	181	That makes it important to identify exactly what goods and services were supplied to RSA by the superior landlords during the vacant unelected period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	182	There are two ways in which one could think of the grant of a time-limited interest in land -LRB- such as a lease or licence -RRB- as a supply of goods or services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	183	One is to regard it as a single supply of the leasehold estate in consideration of periodic payments of rent and the other lessee 's covenants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	184	That is how a real property lawyer would describe the grant of a lease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	185	If that is the right way to look at the supply to RSA in this case , then it first had an intention to use its leasehold estate in making an exempt supply and afterwards decided to use the same estate in making a taxable supply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	186	It would be a change of plan about the use of `` the goods or services concerned '' within the meaning of regulation 109 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	187	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	188	But another way of looking at the matter is to treat the superior owner as granting rights of occupation in successive units of months , quarters , or whatever , depending upon the stipulated intervals for payment of the rent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	189	In that case , the goods or services supplied during the vacant unelected period are different from those supplied afterwards and a change of plan about the use to be made of the leases in the future is not a change of intention about the use of the leases in the past . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	190	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
124	191	In my opinion VAT law has clearly adopted the second analysis for both leases and licences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	192	Section 6 -LRB- 14 -RRB- of the 1994 Act gives the Commissioners power to make regulations : `` with respect to the time at which ... a supply is to be treated as taking place ... where ... it is a supply of goods or services for a consideration the whole or part of which is determined or payable periodically ... and ... the regulations may provide for goods or services to be treated as separately and successively supplied at prescribed times or intervals . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	193	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	194	Pursuant to this power , the Commissioners made regulations 85 and 90 of the 1995 Regulations , which are in similar terms and deal respectively with leases which are treated as supplies of goods and with services supplied for a periodically payable consideration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	195	I shall quote only from regulation 85 : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- ... -LSB- W -RSB- here the grant of a tenancy or lease is a supply of goods ... and the whole or part of the consideration for that grant is payable periodically or from time to time , goods shall be treated as separately and successively supplied at the earlier of the following times - -LRB- a -RRB- each time that a part of the consideration is received by the supplier , or -LRB- b -RRB- each time that the supplier issues a VAT invoice relating to the grant . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	196	Before the tribunal , it appears to have been regarded as uncontroversial that a lease involves separate and successive supplies of goods or services , so that the goods and services supplied during the vacant unelected period are not the same as those supplied afterwards . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	197	There was no reference to regulations 85 and 90 but the submission of counsel for the Commissioners to this effect is recorded at -LSB- 1999 -RSB- V & DR , 336 , 354 E , without further comment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	198	But Park J disagreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	199	He said -LSB- 2000 -RSB- STC 933 , 947e that the regulation dealt with `` the time of a supply '' but not `` the nature of a supply '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	200	So the supply may take place separately and successively , but the goods or services supplied are nevertheless the same . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	201	The majority of the Court of Appeal agreed , although Sedley LJ 's acceptance of the proposition may have been influenced by his view that VAT was a world `` in which factual and legal realties are suspended or inverted : '' -LSB- 2001 -RSB- STC 1476 , 1490 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	202	But I find the notion of the same goods or services being supplied over and over again too hard to grasp . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	203	In my opinion the plain effect of the regulations is to treat each successive supply as different from the one before . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	204	On this point I agree with the tribunal and Arden LJ . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	205	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	206	Mr Gammie QC , in his excellent submissions for RSA , did not spend much time trying to defend the view of the majority of the Court of Appeal on this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	207	He only referred in passing to some comments on section 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Value Added Tax Act 1983 which I made in Customs and Excise Commissioners v Thorn Materials Supply Ltd -LSB- 1998 -RSB- 1 WLR 1106 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	208	That subsection provides that if a person making a supply issues a tax invoice or receives payment before the time when the supply would otherwise be treated as taking place : `` the supply shall , to the extent covered by the invoice or payment , be treated as taking place at the time the invoice is issued or the payment is received . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	209	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	210	I said of this provision -LRB- at pp 1115-1116 -RRB- : `` If there is an advance payment of less than the whole price , a supply which would ordinarily be regarded as a single taxable transaction is treated as having taken place in two or more stages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	211	The time of supply rules therefore provide for what may loosely be called a partial supply , that is to say , a supply treated as having taken place to some extent on one date and to some extent on another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	212	I say ` loosely ' because both supplies are of course of the same goods . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	213	There is not a supply of part of the goods , or an undivided share in the goods , on one date and the rest on another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	214	The tax is not concerned to divide up the goods because it is levied not upon the goods themselves but upon their value . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	215	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	216	Mr Gammie said that it was the same in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	217	There was a supply of the same goods , namely the lease , treated as having taken place as to parts of its value on successive dates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	218	But in my opinion the language of regulations 85 and 90 is quite different from the language of section 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1983 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	219	The latter speaks of `` the supply '' , in the singular , taking place to some extent at one time and , by implication , to the remaining extent at another time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	220	Regulation 85 says that the goods shall be treated as `` separately and successively supplied '' on the dates of the invoices or payments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	221	I would therefore reject the analogy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	222	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	223	Mr Gammie 's primary argument was that it did not matter that the goods and services supplied during the vacant unelected period were different from those supplied after the new intention to make taxable supplies had been formed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	224	He said that although as a matter of ordinary language one could not use or form an intention to use a right to occupy property for a period which had already passed , that should not prevent reattribution under regulation 109 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	225	The economic activity in which RSA had been engaged from the beginning of the vacant unelected period was the letting of property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	226	The fact that it was intending to make exempt sub-lettings meant that it could not claim immediate repayment of VAT on its inputs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	227	But that intention never fructified into any exempt outputs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	228	Instead , it changed its mind and decided to make taxable outputs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	229	So all the inputs , not having been used in making exempt outputs , became cost components in the taxable outputs which , after election , were the only kind which RSA could make . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	230	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	231	This argument was attractively presented but in the end I think it is wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	232	It is in truth based on a number of principles of VAT law which are not relevant to the present case because they have no application to the right to claim an adjustment under regulation 109 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	233	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	234	First , Mr Gammie relies upon the principle that input tax may be deductible even though the input is not directly traceable into any particular output . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	235	If the taxpayer is engaged in an economic activity for the purpose of making taxable outputs , the tax on all inputs which are cost components of that activity , even overheads , are deductible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	236	As Advocate General Jacobs said in Abbey National plc v Customs and Excise Commissioners -LRB- Case C-408 / 98 -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- STC 297 , 307 : '' ... where a taxable person pursues an economic activity in which he makes wholly taxable supplies , all the goods and services supplied to him for the purposes of that activity are cost components of his outputs and all the VAT borne by them should be deductible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	237	The fact that , from a strict bookkeeping point of view , inputs are not attributed to or even apportioned among particular outputs is of no import here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	238	Clearly not all goods and services consumed by a taxable person will be incorporated directly into an identifiable output . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	239	Some will be of the nature of general overheads and , to the extent that those overheads are cost components of taxable supplies , VAT levied on them may be deducted . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	240	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	241	So , says Mr Gammie , it does not matter that the periods for which rent was paid in the vacant unelected period did not coincide with the period for which the properties were eventually sublet . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	242	The earlier rental payments were nevertheless cost components of the later lettings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	243	Indeed , since there were no earlier lettings , they could not have been cost components of anything else . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	244	Secondly , it is clearly established that a trader has a right to deduct VAT from the very moment that he embarks upon the relevant economic enterprise and before he has made any outputs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
124	245	Thus in Rompelman v Minister van Financiën -LRB- Case 268/83 -RRB- -LSB- 1985 -RSB- ECR I-655 the Court of Justice held that a trader who decided to acquire property for letting could claim repayment of VAT on the cost of a right to acquire a building which had not yet been constructed , let alone tenanted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	246	In Intercommunale voor Zeewaterontzilting v Belgium -LRB- Case C-110 / 94 -RRB- -LSB- 1996 -RSB- ECR I-857 this principle was applied to allow deduction of VAT on the cost of a study undertaken by a company in order to decide whether to commence an economic enterprise or not , even though it decided not to proceed and never made any taxable outputs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	247	Thirdly , in Belgium v Ghent Coal Terminal NV -LRB- Case C-37 / 95 -RRB- -LSB- 1998 -RSB- ECR I-1 the Court of Justice confirmed that once a right of deduction had been exercised because the inputs were for the purpose of investment work intended to be used in connection with taxable transactions , the authorities may not claim repayment merely because the taxpayer has been unable to use the goods or services for the intended purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	248	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	249	All this is clear law , but I do not see how it helps RSA . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	250	It shows that if tax is paid on inputs used or intended to be used for an economic activity carried on for the purpose of making taxable outputs , all that tax may be deducted by the trader even though the inputs are not attributable to particular outputs and even though no taxable outputs are actually made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	251	But in the present case , RSA was not carrying on an economic activity for the purpose of making taxable outputs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	252	If it had been , it would have had no need to rely upon regulation 109 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	253	The jurisprudence to which I have referred shows that it would have been able to deduct anyway . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	254	The claim under regulation 109 is made on the basis that during the vacant unelected period RSA was carrying on an economic activity for the purpose of making exempt outputs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	255	In such a case , there is no right to deduction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	256	On the contrary , the principle in the Ghent Coal Terminal case suggests that , just as a failure to make taxable supplies does not destroy a right of deduction , so a failure to make exempt supplies does not create one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	257	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	258	To go back my earlier example of the lawyer who first embarks upon the economic activity of making exempt supplies of financial services , let us assume that he is wholly unsuccessful in doing so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	259	He does not make a single exempt output . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	260	That does not enable him to say that his inputs while he was trying to supply financial services are cost components of his second career in supplying taxable legal services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	261	46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	262	Mr Gammie would , I think , accept this last example . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	263	But he says that RSA 's position is different because it did not first try one economic activity and then switch to another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	264	It was engaged throughout in the same economic activity , namely , letting property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	265	It was at this point that Mr Gammie tended to stress that RSA was never committed to making exempt supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	266	It had an open mind on the question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	267	But , as I said earlier , the entire application of regulation 109 is predicated upon the assumption that RSA was at first intending to make exempt supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	268	Nevertheless , Mr Gammie says in his printed case that the fallacy in the Commissioners ' argument is that they ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	269	`` approach the issue as if RSA were engaged in one economic activity in the vacant unelected periods , in respect of which it made no outputs , and a different economic activity following its election to tax the properties . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	270	47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	271	But in my opinion that is the right way to approach the issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	272	The structure of VAT is built upon the notion that there are some economic activities which are taxable and some which are exempt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	273	An activity which is taxable is by definition not the same for VAT purposes as an activity which is exempt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	274	Usually the nature of the activity determines whether it is taxable or exempt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	275	But letting land can be two different economic activities according to whether or not an election has been made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	276	I therefore think that in deciding to elect and make taxable supplies , RSA were in no different position from the person in my example who decided to change from an activity which involved making exempt supplies to a different activity making taxable supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	277	If there are still inputs around from the previous activity which can be used in the new taxable activity , like a building which has been constructed for exempt letting and is then used , after an election , for taxable letting , the taxpayer will be entitled to an adjustment : compare Finanzamt Goslar v Breitshol -LRB- Case C-400 / 98 -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- STC 355 , 384 , para 52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	278	But he can not rewrite history . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	279	48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	280	Finally I must say something about the decision of this House in Svenska International plc v Customs and Excise Commissioners -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 1 WLR 769 , upon which Mr Gammie particularly relied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	281	In that case a bank -LRB- `` Svenska '' -RRB- continuously provided taxable services such as telephone and electricity to another bank -LRB- `` Branch '' -RRB- from December 1987 but without receiving payment or rendering a tax invoice until 26 June 1992 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	282	During that period it deducted input tax on the cost of providing the services to Branch on the ground that it was intending to make a taxable supply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	283	By the time the invoice was rendered and the supply was treated for VAT purposes as having been made , Svenska and Branch were members of the same VAT group and could not make supplies to each other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	284	The inputs and outputs of each group company from and to outside suppliers and purchasers respectively were treated as those of the group . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	285	The Commissioners claimed repayment of the input tax deducted on the ground that the goods and services had in fact been used by the group in making exempt supplies -LRB- banking services -RRB- to its customers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	286	The House held that the Commissioners were entitled to repayment under what is now regulation 108 , the mirror image of regulation 109 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	287	49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	288	Mr Gammie says that Svenska was paying input tax on supplies received from third parties for the purpose of carrying on the economic activity of making taxable supplies of services to Branch . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	289	In the event , it never made a supply to Branch but used the services instead in the economic activity of making exempt supplies to customers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	290	So it had to repay all the tax which had been deducted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	291	Likewise in this case , RSA made no deduction on supplies received from its landlords for the purpose of carrying on the economic activity of making exempt supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	292	In the event , it never made an exempt supply but used the services in the economic activity of making a taxable supply after its election to waive exemption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	293	So it should be entitled to repayment of all the tax which it failed to deduct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN

124	295	In my opinion the true basis of the Svenska case is not that the taxable inputs were deemed to have been accumulated and then used all at once by Svenska in making exempt supplies after Svenska and Branch had become part of the same group . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	296	Nor does it decide that it is in principle possible for the Commissioners under regulation 108 to reattribute to exempt use the inputs which in real life had already been used with the intention of making taxable supplies , simply on the basis of a later change in the nature of the economic activity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	297	That would be contrary to the principle of the Ghent Coal case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	298	The decision in the Svenska case turned on the special effect of the grouping provisions , which , as the House decided , made it necessary to treat the inputs to Svenska as having been inputs to the group and used by the group to make exempt supplies at the time that Branch so used them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	299	This appears most clearly from the speech of Lord Hope of Craighead -LRB- at p 778 -RRB- : `` The question raised by regulation 34 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- -LSB- now regulation 108 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- -RSB- as to whether , after the group registration , -LSB- the supplies to Svenska -RSB- were used or appropriated for use in making an exempt supply must be answered by applying the rule which section 29 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LSB- of the Value Added Tax Act 1983 -RSB- lays down , that any business carried on by any member of the group must be treated as carried on by the representative member . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
124	300	For the purpose of this exercise the business carried on by -LSB- Branch -RSB- must be treated as carried on by -LSB- Svenska -RSB- ... As that business involved the making of exempt supplies outside the group to customers of -LSB- Branch -RSB- , -LSB- Svenska -RSB- ... must be treated as having used ... the supplies which were attributed to an intended taxable supply ... in making exempt supplies ... I think that the tribunal put the point correctly when they said that this reconstruction of the transactions for VAT purposes , so that inward supplies from outside actually made to -LSB- Svenska -RSB- may be looked at with regard to the outward supplies actually made by -LSB- Branch -RSB- , followed from the effect of section 29 . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	301	51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	302	Thus the effect of section 29 of the 1983 Act was that Svenska was treated as never having carried on the economic activity of making supplies of services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	303	It was the group which was treated as having acquired the input services supplied to Svenska and the group which was treated as having used them for the economic activity of making exempt services supplied by Branch . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	304	The case is not authority for the proposition that , for the purposes of regulations 108 or 109 , one can retrospectively form a new intention about the use of goods or services which have already been used , like the right to occupy premises for a period which has expired . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	305	52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN

124	311	By virtue of section 5 of and Schedule 4 to the Value Added Tax Act 1994 the grant of a major interest in land , defined in section 96 to mean the fee simple or a tenancy for a term certain exceeding 21 years , is to be treated as a supply of goods . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	312	The grant of an interest in land for a shorter period is to be treated as a supply of services -LRB- section 5 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	313	Leasing or letting of immovable property -LRB- subject to certain exceptions which do not apply here -RRB- is exempt from tax -LRB- Group 1 of Schedule 9 to the 1994 Act -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	314	But the exemption can be waived -LRB- paragraph 2 of Schedule 10 to the 1994 Act -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	315	In the context of the present case it was not suggested that there was any relevant distinction to be made between a short and a long lease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	316	In the context of the time of supply rules set out in the Value Added Tax Regulations 1995 separate provisions are made in regulations 85 and 90 in respect of leases treated as supplies of goods and leases treated as supplies of services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	317	But for present purposes the critical elements of these provisions are the same and no distinction need be made in the context of the present case between goods and services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	318	They are to be treated as `` separately and successively supplied '' at the time of receipt of payment or the issue of a relevant VAT invoice , whichever is the earlier . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	319	54 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	320	The respondent -LRB- `` RSA '' -RRB- held leases of certain properties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	321	It paid certain sums to its landlord by way of rent and service charges . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	322	For a time it occupied most of the properties for the purposes of its insurance business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	323	Its supplies of insurance services were exempt from VAT -LRB- section31 of , and Group 2 of Schedule 9 to , the 1994 Act -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	324	But it then found the properties surplus to its requirements and decided to sub-let them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	325	The supplies constituted by such subletting would also be exempt from VAT unless RSA waived exempt status for the properties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	326	Exemption had been waived in respect of the supplies of the properties to RSA by its landlord and so those supplies were taxable supplies for purposes of VAT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	327	RSA accordingly incurred input tax in respect of these supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	328	Over periods referred to as `` the vacant periods '' RSA did not occupy the properties but tried to market them to prospective sub-tenants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	329	During these periods the properties were neither let nor occupied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	330	Eventually it succeeded in sub-letting them and it elected to waive exempt status for each of the properties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	331	It then sought to recover from the Commissioners , the appellants in the present appeal , an amount equal to the input tax which it had incurred and paid in respect of the supplies of the properties to it during the vacant periods and before it had elected to waive exemption in respect of them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	332	This is sought to be done under regulation 109 of the Value Added Tax Regulations 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	333	55 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	334	Regulation 109 -LRB- 1 -RRB- provides : `` This regulation applies where a taxable person has incurred an amount of input tax which has not been attributed to taxable supplies because he intended to use the goods or services in making -LRB- a -RRB- exempt supplies ... and during a period of six years commencing on the first day of the prescribed accounting period in which the attribution was determined and before that intention is fulfilled , he uses or forms an intention to use the goods or services concerned in making taxable supplies . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	335	56 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	336	Some comments may immediately be made on this section . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	337	Firstly , the dispute in the present case concerns only the final phrase of this provision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	338	If one seeks to apply the terms of regulation 109 -LRB- 1 -RRB- to the present case it is clear at the outset that RSA , as a taxable person , had incurred an amount of input tax and that amount had not been attributed to taxable supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	339	I understand it to be accepted that the reasons for that non-attribution was because it intended to make exempt supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	340	As the appellants put it in their printed case at para 1.3 : `` It is common ground that RSA had a sufficient intention to use the properties in making exempt supplies such that it was not entitled to deduct input tax at that point . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	341	Within the time limit of six years and before the intention to make exempt supplies was fulfilled RSA formed the intention to make taxable supplies and indeed fulfilled that intention by sub-letting the properties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	342	The only question arising in the appeal as regards the application of the regulation is whether that intention was an intention to use `` the goods or services concerned in making taxable supplies '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	343	In answering that question I have not found a direct solution from the reported cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	344	57 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	345	Secondly , the `` goods and services concerned '' are the goods and services referred to earlier as the goods and services intended to be used in making exempt supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	346	The regulation requires that those goods and services are now to be used or intended to be used in making taxable supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	347	The goods and services must be the same goods and services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	348	That the use of them was at one time intended to be in exempt supplies and at a later time intended to be in taxable supplies should not make them different goods and services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	349	It is to just such a change that the regulation applies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	350	58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	351	Thirdly , what is required by the regulation is that the intention to make exempt supplies must not have been fulfilled . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	352	If use has been made of the goods and services then the regulation will not apply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	353	What has been done by actual use can not be undone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
124	354	But if there has been no history of use at all and no use has been made of the goods and services then an adjustment may be available . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	355	The regulation may apply where there has been a failure to make exempt supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	356	59 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	357	Fourthly , the regulation envisages that a passage of time will occur between the start of the original intention to make exempt supplies and the use or intention to use the goods or services in making taxable supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	358	Indeed a maximum period of six years is allowed in terms of the regulation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	359	So the regulation may be invoked even although a multiplicity of accounting periods has passed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	360	60 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	361	In Midland Bank plc v Customs and Excise Commissioners -LRB- Case C-98 / 98 -RRB- -LSB- 2000 -RSB- STC 501 , 518 , para 19 the European Court of Justice stated , following earlier case law that : `` the deduction system is meant to relieve the trader entirely of the burden of the VAT payable or paid in the course of all his economic activities , provided that such activities are themselves , in principle , subject to VAT . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	362	The basic rule for deduction is set out in article 17 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	363	That has been implemented in section 26 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1994 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	364	But the Directive allows in article 20 for the making of adjustments to deductions in among other cases the situation where `` after the return is made some change occurs in the factors used to determine the amount to be deducted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	365	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	366	. '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	367	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	368	By section 26 -LRB- 3 -RRB- the implementation legislation empowers the Commissioners to `` make regulations for securing a fair and reasonable attribution of input tax to supplies within subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- above '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	369	Regulation 109 is one of the regulations so made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	370	No one has suggested that it fails to embody the intention of the Directive or exceeds the powers given in the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	371	61 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	372	One argument which has been put forward is to say that the goods had been used or consumed during the vacant periods . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	373	But there is no obvious warrant for equating an attempt to use the properties as a use of them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	374	The fact is that they had remained vacant and unused . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	375	The properties remained unimpaired during the vacant periods and despite the passage of time there is nothing to justify the conclusion that they had in some sense been consumed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	376	62 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	377	But then it is said that the past supplies to RSA are a matter of past history and have as it were disappeared altogether . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	378	In the present case the goods and services were the interests under the lettings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	379	Those interests no doubt require to be treated as supplied separately and successively for the purposes of the time of supply rules and no doubt what have to be treated as separate grants , separate supplies , can be regarded as having passed into history . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	380	But the present case is not concerned with the time of any supply for the purposes of a charge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	381	The case concerns the making of an adjustment under regulation 109 in respect of the right to deduct the input tax which RSA had paid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	382	63 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	383	Throughout the vacant periods RSA was engaged or seeking to be engaged in the economic activity of sub-letting the properties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	384	That activity remained as one of constant intention throughout the vacant periods and was still the intention when the decision to claim exemption was made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	385	RSA intended throughout to sub-let the properties , although they failed to do so , and at no time during the vacant period were the goods or services put to use . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	386	The properties were the same properties all along and it seems to me that there was a direct and immediate link between the interests under the leases and the eventual output transactions constituted by the sub-letting . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	387	Had RSA intended from the outset to make taxable supplies no problem about the deductibility of the input tax it paid would have arisen and there would have been no need to resort to regulation 109 and indeed no room to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	388	What happened was that it wished for commercial reasons during the vacant periods to keep its options open . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	389	In the event no use was made of the goods and services concerned and no exempt supplies were made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	390	In my view the situation is one which the adjustment required by regulation 109 is designed to meet and so satisfy the basic intention of the deduction system in relation to the carrying on of the economic activity of subletting the properties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	391	64 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	392	I would dismiss the appeal . 	lord clyde	self	outcome	0.7	NAN

124	396	The Statutory Provisions 65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	397	Value added tax -LRB- `` VAT '' -RRB- is essentially an EU tax , imposed by Member States in compliance with EU legislation , of which the most important is the Sixth Directive -LRB- EC Council Directive 77/388/EEC -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	398	Member States give effect to the EU legislation -LRB- and in particular , the Sixth Directive -RRB- by national legislation , in the case of the United Kingdom the Value Added Tax Act 1994 -LRB- `` the 1994 Act '' -RRB- and the Value Added Tax Regulations 1995 -LRB- SI 1995/2518 -RRB- -LRB- `` the Regulations '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	399	In this appeal neither side has suggested that the United Kingdom government has failed to implement the Sixth Directive correctly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	400	Nevertheless it is convenient to make some references to it -LRB- as well as to the 1994 Act and the Regulations -RRB- since the general scheme of the national legislation can sometimes be better understood by reference to the Sixth Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	401	Moreover decisions of the European Court of Justice naturally refer principally to the EU legislation in laying down some general principles -LRB- in particular the principle of fiscal neutrality , and the concept of the `` direct and immediate link '' -RRB- which inform the interpretation of the legislation .

124	406	the elements and characteristics of the VAT system which are relevant to this case should be briefly recalled , in particular the principles of the system , the deduction rules and the concept of a taxable person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	407	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
124	408	As the court pointed out in its judgment of 5 May 1982 in Case 15/81 -LRB- Schul v Inspecteur der Invoerrechten en Accijnzen -LSB- 1982 -RSB- ECR 1409 -RRB- , a basic element of the VAT system is that VAT is chargeable on each transaction only after deduction of the amount of the VAT borne directly by the cost of the various components of the price of the goods and services and that the deduction procedure is so designed that only taxable persons may deduct the VAT already charged on the goods and services from the VAT for which they are liable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	409	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	410	Article 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Directive must be considered against that general background . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	411	That provision defines a taxable person as ` any person who independently carries out in any place any economic activity specified in pararaph -LRB- 2 -RRB- , whatever the purpose or results of that activity ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	412	Article 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- provides that ` the economic activities referred to in pararaph -LRB- 1 -RRB- shall comprise all activities of producers , traders and persons supplying services ' In particular , the exploitation of tangible or intangible property for the purpose of obtaining income therefrom on a continuing basis is considered to be an economic activity .

124	413	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	414	Article 17 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Sixth Directive provides that ` the right to deduct shall arise at the time when the deductible tax becomes chargeable ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	415	Article 17 -LRB- 2 -RRB- provides that , in so far as the goods and services are used for the purposes of his taxable transactions , the taxable person is to be entitled ` to deduct from the tax for which he is liable to pay the value-added tax due or paid in respect of goods or services supplied or to be supplied to him by another taxable person ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	416	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	417	From the provisions set forth above it may be concluded that the deduction system is meant to relieve the trader entirely of the burden of the VAT payable or paid in the course of all his economic activities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	418	The common system of value-added tax therefore ensures that all economic activities , whatever their purpose or results , provided that they are themselves subject to VAT , are taxed in a wholly neutral way '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	419	67 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	420	The proviso in the last sentence of the quotation is important , because it is possible -LRB- through the exemption of some economic activities under article 13 of the Sixth Directive -RRB- to be a taxable person without making any taxable supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	421	In those circumstances the tax does not cascade down from one taxable person to another until the end products or `` outputs '' -LRB- whether goods or services -RRB- reach the ultimate consumer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	422	That is one of the complications which detract from the grand simplicity of the tax structure as it has to be considered on this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	423	The other complications are those of the special treatment of the letting of land or buildings , including the so-called `` option to tax '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	424	I must mention the statutory provisions bearing on these three complicating factors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	425	I can do so fairly briefly because the proceedings below at every stage are reported -LRB- the VAT and Duties Tribunal at -LSB- 1999 -RSB- V & DR 336 , Park J at -LSB- 2000 -RSB- STC 933 and the Court of Appeal at -LSB- 2001 -RSB- STC 1476 -RRB- and they cover the relevant provisions of the Sixth Directive , the 1994 Act and the Regulations in some detail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	426	68 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	427	Article 17 -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the Sixth Directive deals with the position of a trader whose business is such that his output supplies are partly exempt and partly taxable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	428	The respondent Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Group Plc -LRB- `` RSA '' , so as to include where appropriate all other companies registered as members of the same group -RRB- is in that position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	429	RSA is in the business of insurance , which is -LRB- under section 31 of , and Group 2 of Schedule 9 to , the 1994 Act -RRB- treated as the making of exempt supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	430	But as Park J explained -LRB- in para 23 of his judgment -RRB- typically an insurance company also makes some supplies which are taxable , even though the bulk of its supplies are exempt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	431	That often happens because the insurer owns property leased to tenants or subtenants and held as an investment , and has exercised its option to tax . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	432	69 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	433	Article 17 -LRB- 5 -RRB- is in the following terms : `` As regards goods and services to be used by a taxable person both for transactions covered by paragraphs 2 and 3 , in respect of which value added tax is deductible , and for transactions in respect of which value added tax is not deductible , only such proportion of the value added tax shall be deductible as is attributable to the former transactions .

124	434	This proportion shall be determined , in accordance with article 19 , for all the transactions carried out by the taxable person . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

124	436	Article 19 provides for the calculation of the deductible proportion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	437	Article 20 provides for the initial deduction to be adjusted `` according to the procedures laid down by the Member States , '' in particular where the deduction made was higher or lower than that to which the taxable person was entitled -LRB- but in general there is to be no adjustment for bad debts or for lost or stolen stock -RRB- .

124	439	The significance of the simple form of words `` for transactions '' in article 17 -LRB- 5 -RRB- has been explained by the European Court of Justice in BLP Group Plc v Commissioners of Customs and Excise -LRB- Case C-494 -RRB- -LSB- 1995 -RSB- ECR I-983 , para 19 : `` The use in that provision of the words ` for transactions ' shows that to give the right to deduct under paragraph 2 , the goods or services in question must have a direct and immediate link with the taxable transactions , and that the ultimate aim pursued by the taxable person is irrelevant in this respect '' .

124	440	This is the concept of the `` direct and immediate link '' which has played an important -LRB- although somewhat intermittent -RRB- part in the argument at different stages of the appeal process . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	441	71 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	442	The provisions of article 17 are given effect principally by sections 24 , 25 and 26 of the 1994 Act and by Part XIV of the Regulations , made under section 26 -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	443	In particular section 26 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- provides for the Regulations to cover two converse cases : `` the making of payments in respect of input tax , by the Commissioners to a taxable person -LRB- or a person who has been a taxable person -RRB- or by a taxable person -LRB- or a person who has been a taxable person -RRB- to the Commissioners , in cases where events prove inaccurate an estimate on the basis of which an attribution was made '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	444	72 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	445	These two cases are provided for -LRB- in reverse order -RRB- by regulations 108 and 109 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	446	It is sufficient to set out regulation 109 , which is of central importance to this appeal : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- This regulation applies where a taxable person has incurred an amount of input tax which has not been attributed to taxable supplies because he intended to use the goods or services in making either -- -LRB- a -RRB- exempt supplies , or -LRB- b -RRB- both taxable and exempt supplies , and during a period of six years commencing on the first day of the prescribed accounting period in which the attribution was determined and before that intention is fulfilled , he uses or forms an intention to use the goods or services concerned in making taxable supplies or , in the case of an attribution within sub-paragraph -LRB- a -RRB- above , in making both taxable and exempt supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	447	-LRB- 2 -RRB- Subject to regulation 110 and where this regulation applies , the Commissioners shall , on receipt of an application made by the taxable person in such form and manner and containing such particulars as they may direct , pay to him an amount equal to the input tax which has become attributable to taxable supplies in accordance with the method which he was required to use when the input tax was first attributed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	448	-LRB- 3 -RRB- For the purposes of this regulation any question as to the nature of any supply shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Act and any Regulations or Orders made thereunder in force at the time when the input tax was first attributed '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	449	73 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	450	Under Group 1 of Schedule 9 to the 1994 Act -LRB- implementing article 13 , para B -LRB- b -RRB- of the Sixth Directive -RRB- the grant of an interest in land -LRB- such as the grant of a lease or tenancy -RRB- is -LRB- if made by a taxable person -RRB- an exempt supply , subject to various exceptions which are not material -LRB- other than as the subject-matter of some submissions made by each side as to supposed anomalies and absurdities -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	451	But under Schedule 10 , para 2 -LRB- and article 13 para C -RRB- a taxable person may elect to waive exemption under Schedule 9 Group 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	452	By Schedule 10 , para 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 4 -RRB- an election to waive exemption can not in general be retrospective , and is irrevocable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	453	The practical consequences of these provisions , and the fiscal and commercial considerations which a landlord and his prospective tenant would have in mind in relation to them , are discussed by Park J in paras 11 to 13 of his judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	454	74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	455	By the combined effect of section 5 , section 96 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- definition of `` major interest '' -RRB- and Schedule 4 , para 4 to the 1994 Act the grant -LRB- in England -RRB- of a lease for more than 21 years is a supply of goods ; the grant of a lease for 21 years or less is a supply of services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	456	The distinction may make a difference in some circumstances , but it was not suggested that it makes any significant difference in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	457	75 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	458	Finally -LRB- in regard to the statutory provisions -RRB- I must refer to regulations 85 and 90 , which seem to have received little attention at the hearing before the Tribunal but featured in the argument before Park J and the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	459	Section 6 of the 1994 Act sets out rules in relation to the time at which a supply of goods or services is treated as being made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	460	These rules are capable , in some circumstances , of producing surprising and apparently artificial results -LRB- see for instance Svenska International plc v Customs and Excise Commissioners -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 1 WLR 769 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	461	Section 6 -LRB- 14 -RRB- provides , so far as material , as follows : `` The Commissioners may by regulations make provision with respect to the time at which a supply is to be treated as taking place in cases where -- -LRB- a -RRB- it is a supply of goods or services for a consideration the whole or part of which is determined or payable periodically , or from time to time , or at the end of any period , or and for any such case as is mentioned in this subsection the regulations may provide for goods or services to be treated as separately and successively supplied at prescribed times or intervals '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	462	The last words quoted -LRB- which Arden LJ in the Court of Appeal referred to as the subsection 's `` tailpiece '' -RRB- may be important as establishing the width of the power to make this part of the Regulations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
124	463	76 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	464	Regulation 85 is headed `` Leases treated as supplies of goods '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	465	regulation 90 is rather wider , as its heading indicates : `` Continuous supplies of services '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	466	It is sufficient for present purposes to set out regulation 85 : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- Subject to paragraph -LRB- 2 -RRB- below , where the grant of a tenancy or lease is a supply of goods by virtue of paragraph 4 of Schedule 4 to the Act , and the whole or part of the consideration for that grant is payable periodically or from time to time , goods shall be treated as separately and successively supplied at the earlier of the following times -- -LRB- a -RRB- each time that a part of the consideration is received by the supplier , or -LRB- b -RRB- each time that the supplier issues a VAT invoice relating to the grant . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	467	Regulation 85 -LRB- 2 -RRB- provides an alternative mechanism for periodic invoices , but keeps the same basic idea of separate and successive supplies at appropriate intervals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	468	77 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	469	The difficulty of this appeal arises from the need to reconcile these complex provisions in a way which is compatible with the general principles laid down by the European Court of Justice , and which provides a fair result in this case without creating unfairness in other cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	470	At different stages in the argument each side has , I think , showed some inclination to press supposed anomalies on your Lordships while at other times urging your Lordships to decide the case on its own facts , and not to worry about other hypothetical cases which are not before the House . 	lord walker	all	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	471	This is a familiar feature in litigation on complex tax legislation and your Lordships are generally disinclined to go far in considering competing anomalies . 	lord walker	all	partagr	0.9	NAN
124	472	Nevertheless it is important to try to discern a coherent structure in the tax . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	473	The Facts and the Proceedings Below 78 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	474	The tribunal -LRB- Mr David Demack -RRB- had a detailed agreed statement of facts supplemented by agreed bundles of documents and some oral evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	475	The tribunal reduced this to eight paragraphs of findings of fact . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	476	As the case has progressed through the courts the essential facts have been further refined , and for present purposes they can be summarised very shortly indeed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	477	79 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	478	RSA had leases of office accommodation from landlords who had themselves exercised the option to tax . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	479	Initially RSA occupied the offices for the purposes of its insurance business -LRB- making exempt outputs -RRB- and so was unable to deduct input tax on rent and service charges which it paid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	480	Then at various dates between November 1991 and April 1993 some of the office accommodation became vacant as it was surplus to the requirements of the insurance business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	481	RSA wished to let it so as to produce rental income . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	482	But because of the difficult state of the property market the accommodation remained vacant for a considerable time , that is -LRB- with exceptions which can be ignored -RRB- until November 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	483	On 21 November 1995 RSA made an election -LRB- under Schedule 10 , para 2 to the 1994 Act -RRB- to waive exemption , and the election was notified to the Commissioners on 21 December 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	484	80 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	485	During what were called the vacant unelected periods RSA was trying to sublet the offices , but was unable to achieve a letting . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	486	It was of course obliged to continue to pay rent and service charges to its own landlords , although the premises were vacant and unproductive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	487	RSA did not elect to waive exemption at an earlier date because it wanted to keep its options open . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	488	It could not foresee whether any prospective subtenant would itself be making taxable or exempt supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	489	81 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	490	Both sides ' arguments have varied a good deal during successive stages of the appeal process . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	491	It is unnecessary to record the evolving arguments in great detail , but I must attempt a brief summary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	492	The tribunal decided in favour of the Commissioners principally on the ground that there was no direct and immediate link between RSA 's inputs between 1991 and 1995 and its taxable outputs thereafter -LRB- although that bald summary does scant justice to Mr Demack 's very careful analysis and discussion of the submissions made to him -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	493	Park J reached the opposite conclusion , largely -LRB- although again this does scant justice to his very careful analysis and discussion -RRB- on the ground that regulations 85 and 90 were concerned only with the time of supply , and were not concerned -LRB- and as a matter of vires , could not be concerned -RRB- with its nature . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	494	On this point Park J followed the majority of the Court of Appeal in B J Rice & Associates v Customs and Excise Commissioners -LSB- 1996 -RSB- STC 581 : see especially the judgment of Ward LJ at p 590 , considering section 5 -LRB- 9 -RRB- of the Value Added Tax Act 1983 -LRB- the counterpart of section 6 -LRB- 14 -RRB- of the 1994 Act -RRB- but not referring to its `` tailpiece '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	495	Park J therefore rejected the tribunal 's view as to the lack of a direct and immediate link . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	496	He said -LRB- para 59 -RRB- : `` The tribunal 's second reason for its conclusion was that the direct and immediate link which was required was missing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	497	If I agreed that the link was missing I would agree with the result which the tribunal reached . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	498	But , as I have said earlier , I consider that the direct and immediate link was not missing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	499	If I understand the tribunal correctly , it considered that the quarterly rental payments which RSA made during the vacant unelected periods secured for it a series of separate inputs , each of which lasted for only three months . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	500	For the reasons which I have given earlier in this judgement , and which I will not repeat , I do not accept this analysis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	501	In my view RSA 's superior lease of each property was one input , not a multiplicity of separate short-term inputs , and all RSA 's payments of rents -LRB- including service charge rents -RRB- during the vacant unelected periods were cost components of the input '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	502	82 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	503	In the Court of Appeal the majority -LRB- Aldous and Sedley LJJ -RRB- followed Park J in treating the relevant supply -LRB- as I understand it , to RSA -RRB- as the grant of the lease , despite regulation 85 -LRB- see especially the judgment of Aldous LJ at para 76 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	504	Arden LJ took a broader view of the scope of section 6 -LRB- 14 -RRB- and regulation 85 -LRB- see paras 44 , 45 and 49 of her judgment -RRB- and concluded -LRB- para 50 -RRB- , as the tribunal had , that there was no direct and immediate link . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	505	So the majority reached the same conclusion as Park J on broadly the same grounds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	506	Discussion 83 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	507	In my opinion Arden LJ was correct in her analysis and conclusion as to the scope of section 6 -LRB- 14 -RRB- and regulation 85 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	508	That does not necessarily involve saying that B J Rice & Associates v Customs and Excise Commissioners was wrongly decided , as it was concerned with a different factual situation -LRB- an invoice sent to a client before the consultant was registered for VAT -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	509	On this point I can not usefully add more to the observations of my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann , whose opinion I have had the advantage of reading in draft . 	lord walker	lord hoffmann	ackn	0.9	NAN
124	509	On this point I can not usefully add more to the observations of my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann , whose opinion I have had the advantage of reading in draft . 	lord walker	lord hoffmann	ackn	0.9	NAN
124	510	84 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	511	However in a further evolution of the argument Mr Gammie QC did not really seek to uphold the reasoning of the majority of the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	512	He argued that even if the lease held by RSA ought to be regarded as a series of separate and successive supplies to it , those supplies had not been used for any purpose so long as the offices were vacant and unproductive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	513	They were therefore still available , he said , to be attributed to taxable outputs made after 1995 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	514	85 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	515	In support of this proposition Mr Gammie cited a number of well-known authorities , including the decisions of the European Court of Justice in Intercommunale voor Zeewaterontzilting v Belgium -LRB- Case C-110 / 94 -RRB- -LSB- 1996 -RSB- ECR I-857 , Belgium v Ghent Coal Terminal NV -LRB- Case C-37 / 95 -RRB- -LSB- 1998 -RSB- ECR I-1and Abbey National plc v Customs and Excise Commissioners -LRB- Case C-408 / 98 -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- STC 297 and the decision of your Lordships ' House in Svenska International plc v Customs and Excise Commissioners -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 1 WLR 769 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	516	I agree with Lord Hoffmann that the principles stated in these cases , although not in doubt , do not really assist RSA . 	lord walker	lord hoffmann	NAN	0.9	NAN
124	517	Svenska turned on specific statutory provisions about grouping -LRB- which might be thought to have produced an artificial result , but arguably the real artificiality lay in Svenska 's uncommercial conduct in leaving its output supplies unbilled for so long -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	518	Abbey National makes clear that cost components may include overheads , which is not in dispute but does not really get RSA home . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	519	Ghent Coal and Intercommunale were concerned with a single economic activity which would have made taxable supplies in due course , had it not been interrupted by compulsory acquisition -LRB- in Ghent Coal -RRB- or failed to get beyond the stage of a feasibility study -LRB- in Intercommunale -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	520	86 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	521	RSA 's real grievance , it seems to me -LRB- emphasised by Mr Gammie 's occasional references in his submissions to his clients having been honest and played fair -RRB- arises from the inescapable difference between a trader who makes taxable supplies and a trader who makes exempt supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	522	If a trader is in business making only taxable supplies , and finds itself with a rented office or warehouse vacant because of over-capacity , it would be able to continue to deduct the input tax paid to the landlord -LRB- assuming the landlord to have opted to tax -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	523	That would be so even in the trader saw no prospect of subletting before the end of the lease , and resigned itself to some wasted expenditure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	524	The wasted expenditure would still be a cost component of the business as a whole . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	525	It would be comparable -LRB- although the analogy can not be taken too far -RRB- to perishable trading stock which had to be written off . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	526	87 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	527	Mr Gammie argued that his clients should not be at a disadvantage because they genuinely did not know what they wanted to do with the vacant offices , and were candid enough to acknowledge that . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	528	The point is made in RSA 's printed case , para 5.16 : '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	529	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	530	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	531	the perishable quality of an input does not prevent its cost being a component of future outputs with a direct and immediate link to those outputs '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	532	The printed case also -LRB- in para 5.18 -RRB- disputes whether there is any real analogy between perishable goods and : `` the supply of the properties to RSA by its landlords for a quarterly period , -LSB- which -RSB- was part of a continuous chain of supply on which RSA 's current ownership and ability to make taxable outputs depended '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	533	88 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	534	As I have said , the analogy can not be pressed too far . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	535	But it is an inescapable consequence of the general structure of VAT that a trader who makes partially exempt and partially taxable supplies -LRB- or who switches from exempt to taxable supplies -RRB- can not expect precisely the same treatment as one who makes taxable supplies throughout . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	536	That would be pressing the principle of fiscal neutrality too far . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	537	A trader whose outputs have in the past been wholly or partially exempt must , if he is to be able to reclaim input tax , be able to show that his position meets the fairly precise requirements of regulation 109 , which is ultimately derived -LRB- through a chain of provisions which I need not repeat -RRB- from article 17 -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the Sixth Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	538	Even if successive input supplies of office accommodation can in some sense be described as a continuous chain of supply -LRB- which RSA had to pay for in order to avoid forfeiture -RRB- , it was simply not possible for RSA , in or about November 1995 , to use or form an intention to use -LRB- the crucial words in regulation 109 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- supplies of accommodation for successive periods of three months , each of which was then past history . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	539	-LRB- That is not to say that some past supplies , especially of goods of a permanent nature , might not have come within regulation 109 . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	540	89 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	541	In my opinion the scope of section 6 -LRB- 14 -RRB- of the 1994 Act , and the language of regulation 85 , are ultimately decisive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
124	542	For these reasons and for the further reasons in the opinion of Lord Hoffmann I would allow this appeal and restore the decision of the tribunal . 	lord walker	lord hoffmann	fullagr	1	NAN
124	543	In accordance with the terms on which leave to appeal was granted I would not disturb the order as to costs below and I would make no order as to costs before the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
