182	11	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
182	12	LORD HOFFMANN 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
182	13	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
182	14	In 1987 Lady Ingram , who was then 72 , gave her country house and 61 acres of land in Berkshire in trust for her children and grandchildren . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
182	15	She made a gift rather than allowing the property to pass under her will in an attempt to avoid what would otherwise have been a liability to inheritance tax on her death . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
182	16	Until the previous year , the gift itself would have attracted capital transfer tax , as inheritance tax was then called . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
182	17	But section 3A of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 , inserted by the Finance Act 1986 , enabled such a gift to be a `` potentially exempt transfer '' which would be free from inheritance tax unless the donor died within the next seven years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
182	18	There was however a complication . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
182	19	Lady Ingram had lived in the house for more than 40 years and did not want to move out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
182	20	The beneficiaries were willing to allow her to stay , but an informal arrangement of this kind would have fallen foul of section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 , of which the material parts read as follows : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LSB- T -RSB- his section applies where , on or after 18 March 1986 , an individual disposes of any property by way of gift and either - -LRB- a -RRB- possession and enjoyment of the property is not bona fide assumed by the donee at or before the beginning of the relevant period ; or -LRB- b -RRB- at any time in the relevant period the property is not enjoyed to the entire exclusion , or virtually to the entire exclusion , of the donor and of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise ; and in this section ` the relevant period ' means a period ending on the date of the donor 's death and beginning seven years before that date or , if it is later , on the date of the gift . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
182	21	-LRB- 2 -RRB- If and so long as - -LRB- a -RRB- possession and enjoyment of any property is not bona fide assumed as mentioned in sub-section -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- above , or -LRB- b -RRB- any property is not enjoyed as mentioned in subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- above , the property is referred to -LRB- in relation to the gift and the donor -RRB- as property subject to a reservation . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
182	22	-LRB- 3 -RRB- If , immediately before the death of the donor , there is any property which , in relation to him , is property subject to a reservation then , to the extent that the property would not , apart from this section , form part of the donor 's estate immediately before his death , that property shall be treated for the purposes of the 1984 Act as property to which he was beneficially entitled immediately before his death . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
182	23	So if Lady Ingram had simply continued to live in the house , she would not have been excluded from enjoyment of the subject-matter of the gift and for the purposes of inheritance tax the gift would have been ineffective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
182	24	Section 102 has a long history . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
182	25	Provisions in similar terms existed in connection with estate duty -LRB- section 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- of the Finance Act 1894 -RRB- and before that , account duty -LRB- section 11 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1889 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
182	26	There have been similar provisions in Australia . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
182	27	It has been interpreted on a number of occasions by the House of Lords and Privy Council . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
182	28	The theme which runs through all the cases is that although the section does not allow a donor to have his cake and eat it , there is nothing to stop him from carefully dividing up the cake , eating part and having the rest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
182	29	If the benefits which the donor continues to enjoy are by virtue of property which was never comprised in the gift , he has not reserved any benefit out of the property of which he disposed : see Lord Simonds in St. Aubyn v. Attorney General -LSB- 1952 -RSB- A.C. 15 , 22-23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
182	30	If one applies this proposition to the highly sophisticated English land law , by which various interests , each regarded as separate items of property , can subsist simultaneously in respect of the same land , it is clear that the scope for discrimination in limiting the terms of the gift to exclude interests which the donor wishes to retain is very wide . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
182	31	In particular , the beneficial ownership of land may be divided in terms of time as well as space , so that the right to enjoyment of the land for a limited period , such as for life or a term of years , and the right to enjoy the land after the expiry of that period , can exist simultaneously as property interests in possession and in remainder or reversion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
182	32	One such interest may form the subject-matter of a gift while the other is retained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
182	33	An example is Munro v. Commissioner of Stamp Duties for New South Wales -LSB- 1934 -RSB- A.C. 61 in which the owner of a farm was a member of a partnership with his children to which he had granted an informal tenancy or exclusive licence under which the partners occupied the land . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
182	34	A few years later he gave the freehold to various of his children but continued to occupy the property as a member of the partnership . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
182	35	The Privy Council held that gift had been subject to the rights of the partnership , so that the donor 's occupation was by virtue of property which had never been included in the gift . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
182	36	Lady Ingram was therefore advised to make a gift which excluded a proprietary interest entitling her to continue to live in the property for the rest of her life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
182	37	Ideally she would have wished to reserve to herself a life interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
182	38	This would have presented no problems from the point of view of the law of property , but for a different reason would not have served her purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
182	39	The reservation of a life interest would have made the land `` settled property '' as defined in Part III of the Act of 1984 and in consequence , Lady Ingram would have been treated for the purposes of liability to inheritance tax as beneficially entitled to the whole property : see section 49 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
182	40	So the gift would have made no difference . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
182	41	It was therefore necessary for her to retain an interest for a fixed term of years , that is to say , a leasehold interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
182	42	The problem was how to bring such an interest into existence so that she could retain the lease and give away the reversion expectant upon it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
182	43	A lease requires a lessor and a lessee , so Lady Ingram could not have granted a lease to herself : see Rye v. Rye -LSB- 1962 -RSB- A.C. 496 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
182	44	One method , perhaps the most obvious method , was to convey the property to the trustees for her family subject to an obligation simultaneously to grant a lease back to her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
182	45	But , for reasons which I shall mention later , her advisers had doubts about whether such a transaction would fall outside section 102 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
182	46	So they resorted to a more elaborate method . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
182	47	On 29 March 1987 Lady Ingram conveyed the property to her solicitor Mr. MacFadyen to hold as her nominee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
182	48	On 30 March 1987 he granted her a lease of the property -LRB- actually , two identical leases of different parts -RRB- for 20 years rent free , giving no covenants except the covenant for quiet enjoyment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
182	49	On 31 March 1987 Mr. MacFadyen , at Lady Ingram 's direction , conveyed the property , subject to the leases , to trustees to hold on trusts declared in a separate document for the benefit of her children and grandchildren . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
182	50	On 3 February 1989 Lady Ingram died . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
182	51	She did not survive the statutory seven years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
182	52	She did not even survive the three years which would have entitled her estate to pay a reduced rate of duty : see section 7 -LRB- 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
182	53	But the question of whether section 102 of the Act of 1986 applied remained important . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
182	54	If it did not apply , the effect of sections 3 and 3A was that tax would be payable on a transfer of value calculated by reference to the value of the property at the time of the gift . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
182	55	On the other hand , if section 102 applied , the property would be deemed to form part of Lady Ingram 's estate at her death and tax would be payable upon its value at that time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
182	56	In the intervening period there had been a sharp rise in property prices in the south of England and the value at death was much higher than it had been at the time of the gift . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
182	57	On 10 October 1994 the Commissioners of Inland Revenue made a determination under section 221 of the 1984 Act that section 102 applied and that the value of Lady Ingram 's estate at her death was therefore deemed to include the value of the unencumbered freehold of the property at that time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
182	58	With the agreement of the commissioners , her executors appealed directly to the High Court and the appeal came before Ferris J . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
182	59	The contentions of the Revenue may be summarised as follows : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the leases granted by Mr. MacFadyen to Lady Ingram were void because a nominee can not grant a lease to his beneficiary any more than a man may grant a lease to himself ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- As a result , Lady Ingram only obtained an effective lease , legal or equitable , at the moment after Mr. MacFadyen conveyed the freehold to the trustees for the family . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
182	60	At that point the lease became effective , either because the trustees were treated as having granted it in law or because they were bound in equity by a constructive trust to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
182	61	-LRB- 3 -RRB- Such a transaction amounted to the reservation of a benefit out of the property comprised in the gift because the grant of a leasehold interest to Lady Ingram only became possible after the trustees had taken the unencumbered freehold . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
182	62	It was therefore a benefit derived from the property which had been given to the trustees and not an item of property which Lady Ingram had never given . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
182	63	-LRB- 4 -RRB- Even if the leases granted by Mr. MacFadyen were valid , they were artificial steps in a composite transaction which had been inserted solely for the purpose of avoiding tax . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
182	64	They ought therefore to be disregarded and section 102 applied as if Lady Ingram had simply conveyed the property to the trustees in return for the grant of a lease back . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
182	65	Ferris J. agreed that the original grant of the leases had been invalid but held that this did not mean that the leasehold interest which Lady Ingram admittedly acquired against the trustees was a benefit reserved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
182	66	He said that there had been no point of time at which the trustees and beneficiaries had held the property otherwise than subject to the leasehold interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
182	67	Lady Ingram never intended to give them the property free from those interests and they were not therefore included in the gift . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
182	68	As he had held that the original leases were invalid but that section 102 nevertheless had no application , it was unnecessary for Ferris J. to decide whether they should be disregarded as artificial steps in a scheme of tax avoidance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
182	69	The Court of Appeal by a majority -LRB- Nourse and Evans L.JJ. , Millett L.J. dissenting -RRB- agreed that the leases were invalid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
182	70	By a similar majority , they disagreed with the judge 's finding that section 102 did not apply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
182	71	In essence , they held that it was conceptually impossible for a lease to come into existence until the lessor had acquired the freehold interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
182	72	It followed that the gift must have been the unencumbered freehold interest and the lease must have been a benefit reserved out of it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
182	73	A similar point had arisen in In re Nichols , deceased -LSB- 1974 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 296 ; -LSB- 1975 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 534 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
182	74	It was probably the view expressed by the Court of Appeal in this case which led Lady Ingram 's advisers to cast the transaction in the form which they did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
182	75	Sir Philip Nichols conveyed his country house and estate to his son Francis by way of gift subject to the son 's agreement to grant him a lease back . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
182	76	Walton J. said that in principle such a transaction was a gift only of the reversion expectant on the determination of the lease , which was therefore not a benefit reserved out of the gift . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
182	77	He analysed the position as follows at -LSB- 1974 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 296 , 299 : `` If I consider the matter in principle , it appears to me that if a donor D conveys property to a trustee T to hold upon trust as to some interest therein for a beneficiary B and as to the remainder of the property for the donor D himself , all that the donor has given to the beneficiary is the property shorn of the rights to be held in trust for D. . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
182	78	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
182	79	Now , suppose that there is no intermediate trustee , but that B takes the property directly but burdened with the equitable obligation to grant the lease back . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
182	80	Does this make any difference ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
182	81	In my opinion , the answer must be in the negative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
182	82	For in such a case , in very truth , B takes the property as trustee , and the coincidence in identity of B and T can not make any real difference to the legal analysis . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
182	83	The Court of Appeal -LRB- Russell and Cairns L.JJ and Reginald Goff J. -RRB- , after a lengthy review of the authorities , expressed a different view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
182	84	Giving the judgment of the court , Goff J. said at -LSB- 1975 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 534 , 543 : `` Having thus reviewed the authorities , we return to the question what was given , and we think that a grant of the fee simple , subject to and with the benefit of a lease back , where such a grant is made by a person who owns the whole freehold free from any lease , is a grant of the whole fee simple with something reserved out of it , and not a gift of a partial interest leaving something in the hands of the grantor which he has not given . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
182	85	It is not like a reversion or remainder expectant on a prior interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
182	86	It gives an immediate right to the rent , together with a right to distrain for it , and , if there be a proviso for re-entry , a right to forfeit the lease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
182	87	Of course , where , as in Munro v. Commissioner of Stamp Duties -LRB- N.S.W. -RRB- -LSB- 1934 -RSB- A.C. 61 , the lease , or , as it then may have been , a licence coupled with an interest , arises under a prior independent transaction , no question can arise because the donor then gives all that he has , but where it is a condition of the gift that a lease back shall be created , we think that must , on a true analysis , be a reservation of a benefit out of the gift and not something not given at all . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
182	88	He went on to say that it was not necessary to reach a final conclusion on the point because the son had given covenants in the lease -LRB- as to repairs and the payment of Tithe Redemption Annuity -RRB- which amounted to benefits unrelated to any interest previously enjoyed by Sir Philip . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
182	89	There was no way in which they could be said to be property which he had separated from the gift and retained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
182	90	In this case , of course , Mr. MacFadyen and the trustees as his successors to the freehold gave no covenants except that for quiet enjoyment , which is no more than an incident of the leasehold estate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
182	91	On the assumption that the prior grant of the leases was invalid , the question on which the Court of Appeal in In re Nichols , deceased -LSB- 1975 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 534 found it unnecessary to express a final conclusion now has to be decided . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
182	92	The majority of the Court of Appeal followed the dicta of Goff J. For my part , I do not find the single sentence which constitutes the reasoning easy to follow . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
182	93	A lease back is not like a remainder or reversion , it was said , because `` it gives an immediate right to the rent , together with a right to distrain for it , and , if there be a proviso for re-entry , a right to forfeit the lease . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
182	94	This is certainly true but I can not see its relevance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
182	95	If there is a rent payable and a proviso for re-entry , these rights are part of the property comprised in the gift which passes to the donee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
182	96	But how does this affect the question of whether or not the leasehold interest , burdened by such covenants and conditions , can be regarded as property retained by the donor ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
182	97	Nourse L.J. , although treating the dicta as authoritative , said tactfully that he `` would not -LSB- himself -RSB- attach weight to the rights of the landlord to the rent , to distrain for it and to forfeit the lease . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
182	98	He found the reasoning inferentially in the court 's citation from Lang v. Webb -LRB- 1912 -RRB- 13 C.L.R. 503 and in particular the judgment of Isaacs J . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
182	99	The essence of the latter 's reasoning was that the gift of the freehold `` had to be complete before the donee could execute to her the lease of the property . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
182	100	It is a curious feature of the debate in this case that both sides claim that their views reflect the reality and not the mere form of the transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
182	101	But the Revenue 's version of reality seems entirely dependent upon the scintilla temporis which must elapse between the conveyance of the freehold to the donee and the creation of the leasehold interest in favour of the donor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
182	102	For my part , I do not think that a theory based upon the notion of a scintilla temporis can have a very powerful grasp on reality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
182	103	-LRB- Compare Abbey National Building Society v. Cann -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 A.C. 56 , 92-93 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
182	104	I therefore prefer the reasoning of Walton J . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
182	105	It is true that as a matter of conveyancing , no lease can come into existence until the freehold has been vested in the intended lessor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
182	106	But section 102 is concerned not with conveyancing but with beneficial interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
182	107	It uses words like `` enjoyment '' and `` benefit '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
182	108	In Attorney-General v. Worrall -LSB- 1895 -RSB- Q.B. 99 , 104 , a case on a predecessor of section 102 , Lord Esher M.R. began his judgment with the words : `` It has been held that in cases of this kind the court has to determine what the real nature of the transaction was , apart from legal phraseology and the forms of conveyancing . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
182	109	If one looks at the real nature of the transaction , there seems to me no doubt that Ferris J. was right in saying that the trustees and beneficiaries never at any time acquired the land free of Lady Ingram 's leasehold interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
182	110	The need for a conveyance to be followed by a lease back is a mere matter of conveyancing form . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
182	111	As I have said , she could have reserved a life interest by a unilateral disposition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
182	112	Why should it make a difference that the reservation of a term of years happens to require the participation of another party if the substance of the matter is that the property will pass only subject to the lease ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
182	113	Mr. Nugee Q.C. and Mr. Furness , on behalf of the Commissioners , each explained patiently and clearly that the great difference was that a lease is a contract as well as an estate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
182	114	It involves obligations between the parties enforceable in contract or by virtue of privity of estate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
182	115	It can not therefore be regarded as the mere reservation of property like a life interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
182	116	This is true and if , in addition to the leasehold estate which she reserved , Lady Ingram had obtained by covenant any additional benefits , as in In re Nichols , deceased -LSB- 1975 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 534 , they would have been benefits reserved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
182	117	But in a case such as this , when she in fact received no such benefits , the contractual nature of the lease seems to me a matter of conveyancing theory rather than substance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
182	118	Before parting with this aspect of the case , I should say something about the more general considerations involved in the application of section 102 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
182	119	Its policy has puzzled people for a long time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
182	120	For one thing , it is in one sense a penal section . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
182	121	Not only may you not have your cake and eat it , but if you eat more than a few de minimis crumbs of what was given , you are deemed for tax purposes to have eaten the lot . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
182	122	Secondly , a superficial reading of phrases like `` beneficial enjoyment of the property '' and enjoyment of property `` to the entire exclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
182	123	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
182	124	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
182	125	of the donor '' has led to numerous occasions in the past century in which the Revenue has put forward the proposition that , as a matter of practical common sense , it simply must be contrary to the policy of the statute for a donor to be able to give away property such as a house and go on enjoying the benefit of the property by continuing to live there . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
182	126	This is the premise upon which the Revenue claim the high ground of substance and reality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
182	127	Mr. Nugee said that for Lady Ingram to have made a potentially exempt transfer and retained the right to stay in the house was simply too good to be true and in the Court of Appeal , Evans L.J. accepted this proposition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
182	128	But this approach ignores the fact that `` property '' in section 102 is not something which has physical existence like a house but a specific interest in that property , a legal construct , which can co - exist with other interests in the same physical object . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
182	129	Section 102 does not therefore prevent people from deriving benefit from the object in which they have given away an interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
182	130	It applies only when they derive the benefit from that interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
182	131	If Lady Ingram had been dealing with a fund of investments instead of a house , she would have had no difficulty in achieving the same result , in economic terms , as the transaction in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
182	132	She could have used part of the fund to purchase an annuity which would have guaranteed her exactly the same income as she had been receiving from the fund and given away the rest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
182	133	Unless she needed to resort to capital , her outward circumstances would have continued unchanged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
182	134	Why should it make a difference that her asset happened to consist of land ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
182	135	The gift was a real gift of the capital value in the land after deduction of her leasehold interest in the same way as a gift of the capital value of a fund after deduction of an annuity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
182	136	What , then , is the policy of section 102 ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
182	137	It requires people to define precisely the interests which they are giving away and the interests , if any , which they are retaining . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
182	138	Once they have given away an interest they may not receive back any benefits from that interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
182	139	In Lang v. Webb -LRB- 1912 -RRB- 13 C.L.R. 503 , 513 Isaacs J. suggested that the policy was to avoid the `` delay , expense and uncertainty '' of requiring the Revenue to investigate whether a gift was genuine or pretended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
182	140	It laid down a rule that if the donor continued to derive any benefit from the property in which an interest had been given , it would be treated as a pretended gift unless the benefit could be shown to be referable to a specific proprietary interest which he had retained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
182	141	This is probably the most plausible explanation and accepting this as the policy , I think there can be no doubt that the interest retained by Lady Ingram was a proprietary interest defined with the necessary precision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
182	142	This conclusion is sufficient to dispose of the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
182	143	If the gift was a potentially exempt transfer on the assumption that the grant of the leases was void , it is unnecessary to decide whether the leases were valid or whether , if they were , they should be ignored on the principle of W.T. Ramsay Ltd. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners -LSB- 1982 -RSB- A.C. 300 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
182	144	But the question of the validity of the leases was fully argued and I will therefore say that in my opinion they were valid for the reasons stated in the judgment of Millett L.J. in the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
182	145	Ferris J. and the majority of the Court of Appeal followed the decision of the Inner House of the Court of Session in Kildrummy -LRB- Jersey -RRB- Ltd. v. I.R.C. -LSB- 1990 -RSB- S.T.C. 657 which , starting from the proposition that a man could not grant a lease to himself -LRB- Rye v. Rye -LSB- 1962 -RSB- A.C. 496 -RRB- , went on to hold that a lease granted by an owner of land to a nominee acting on his behalf was equivalent to the grant of a lease to himself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
182	146	This treats the nominee as an agent acting on behalf of the owner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
182	147	I do not intend to cast any doubt upon this analysis as a matter of Scots law and , if it is correct , the conclusion undoubtedly follows : see Grey v. Ellison -LRB- 1856 -RRB- 1 Giff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
182	148	438 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
182	149	But a trustee in English law is not an agent for his beneficiary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
182	150	He contracts in his own name , with a right of indemnity against the beneficiary for the liabilities he has incurred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
182	151	Of course the law will not allow a beneficiary to sue to enforce obligations in respect of which the trustee would have a cross-claim for indemnity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
182	152	But this is a procedural bar , based upon avoiding circularity of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
182	153	On the other hand , if a beneficiary who has granted a lease to a nominee for himself were to convey the freehold , the trustee 's liabilities under the lease would become enforceable and he would be dependent upon the value of his claim for indemnity against the beneficiary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
182	154	The prospect of this happening means that one can not say that a lease from an owner to his nominee requires no `` meeting of minds '' ; the nominee is incurring what may be real obligations and can not be regarded as a mere puppet . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
182	155	The scope of the Ramsay principle does not arise and I therefore prefer to say nothing about it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
182	156	I would therefore allow the appeal . 	lord hoffmann	self	outcome	0.7	lord hoffmann

182	164	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
182	165	The issue which arises on this appeal is whether a gift of property made during her lifetime by Lady Ingram , who died on 3 February 1989 , was subject to a reservation within the meaning of Section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 , and should therefore be treated for the purposes of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 as property to which she was beneficially entitled immediately before her death . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
182	166	Section 102 provides : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- Subject to subsections -LRB- 5 -RRB- and -LRB- 6 -RRB- below , this section applies where , on or after 18th March 1986 , an individual disposes of any property by way of gift and either -- -LRB- a -RRB- possession and enjoyment of the property is not bona fide assumed by the donee at or before the beginning of the relevant period ; or -LRB- b -RRB- at any time in the relevant period the property is not enjoyed to the entire exclusion , or virtually to the entire exclusion , of the donor and of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise ; and in this section ` the relevant period ' means a period ending on the date of the donor 's death and beginning seven years before that date or , if it is later , on the date of the gift . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
182	167	-LRB- 2 -RRB- If and so long as -- -LRB- a -RRB- possession and enjoyment of any property is not bona fide assumed as mentioned in subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- above , or -LRB- b -RRB- any property is not enjoyed as mentioned in subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- above ; the property is referred to -LRB- in relation to the gift and the donor -RRB- as property subject to a reservation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
182	168	-LRB- 3 -RRB- If , immediately before the death of the donor , there is any property which , in relation to him , is property subject to a reservation then , to the extent that the property would not , apart from this section , form part of the donor 's estate immediately before his death , that property shall be treated for the purposes of the 1984 Act as property to which he was beneficially entitled immediately before his death . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
182	169	In St. Aubyn v. Attorney General -LSB- 1952 -RSB- A.C. 15 this House considered the similar wording of section 43 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Finance Act 1940 relating to bona fide assumption of possession and enjoyment of property by a person becoming entitled thereto to the entire exclusion of the person who had had an interest therein and of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
182	170	Lord Simonds stated at p. 29 : `` I venture to think that much of the argument that was addressed to the House in this case and much of the confusion that has arisen in the past on this admittedly difficult branch of the law have been due to the failure to bear in mind that that of which enjoyment is to be assumed and retained and from which there is to be exclusion of the donor and any benefit to him by contract or otherwise is that which is truly given , a proposition which is obvious enough in the case of two separate estates but more difficult to follow and apply where trusts are declared of a single property which are not completely exhaustive in favour of a donee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
182	171	It should at least be clear from the judgment of Lord Russell of Killowen that by retaining something which he has never given a donor does not bring himself within the mischief of the section . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
182	172	Lord Radcliffe , after referring to earlier authorities , stated at p. 49 : `` All these decisions proceed upon a common principle , namely , that it is the possession and enjoyment of the actual property given that has to be taken account of , and that if that property is , as it may be , a limited equitable interest or an equitable interest distinct from another such interest which is not given or an interest in property subject to an interest that is retained , it is of no consequence for this purpose that the retained interest remains in the beneficial enjoyment of the person who provides the gift . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
182	173	In the present case it is clear that Lady Ingram sought to make a gift which came within the ambit of the protection described in the two judgments in the St. Aubyn case by making a gift of an interest in property distinct from another interest in the property which she retained and which remained in her beneficial enjoyment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
182	174	The manner in which Lady Ingram made the gift was as follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
182	175	In 1987 she was the owner in fee simple of a house , Hurst Lodge , and surrounding and adjacent lands -LRB- which house and lands I shall call `` Hurst Lodge '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
182	176	She wished to make a gift of Hurst Lodge to her children and grandchildren but to retain actual occupation of Hurst Lodge during her life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
182	177	Therefore , after taking advice from counsel , she decided to create a leasehold interest in Hurst Lodge for a term of 20 years and then to make a gift of her freehold interest in Hurst Lodge subject to the term of 20 years -LRB- at no rent -RRB- which she would retain for herself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
182	178	On 29 March 1987 Lady Ingram conveyed the fee simple estate to her solicitor , Mr. MacFadyen , to hold as her nominee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
182	179	On 30 March 1987 Mr. MacFadyen by two leases -LRB- relating to different parts -RRB- demised Hurst Lodge to Lady Ingram for a term of 20 years free of rent , and he entered into no covenants except a covenant for quiet enjoyment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
182	180	On 31 March 1987 , at Lady Ingram 's direction , Mr. MacFadyen conveyed Hurst Lodge , subject to the leases to Lady Ingram , to trustees to hold on trusts declared in separate declarations of trust for the benefit of her children and grandchildren . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
182	181	The argument advanced on behalf of the Commissioners was , in essence , that the leases purported to have been granted by Mr. MacFadyen to Lady Ingram were a nullity , because a nominee can not effectively grant a lease to his principal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
182	182	In consequence no leases were in existence when the freehold given by Lady Ingram vested in the trustees , but the trustees and the beneficiaries were subject to an equitable obligation in favour of Lady Ingram to give effect to the purported leases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
182	183	Therefore the gift made by Lady Ingram was a grant of the whole fee simple with the obligation to make a lease back to Lady Ingram being a reservation out of the benefit of the gift rather than a grant of the property shorn of the leasehold interest which remained in the hands of Lady Ingram and which she had not given . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
182	184	In the High Court Ferris J. accepted the first part of the Commissioners ' argument and held that the leases purportedly granted by Mr. MacFadyen to Lady Ingram were a nullity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
182	185	But he rejected the second part of the argument and he stated -LSB- 1995 -RSB- S.T.C. 564 , 580D : `` It appears to me that , whether Lady Ingram took her leasehold interests in equity or by the operation of section 65 of the Law of Property Act , what the trustees and the beneficiaries under the declarations of trust have finished up with is the property subject to those leasehold interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
182	186	Unless it can be said that there was a period or point of time at which the trustees and beneficiaries had a more extensive interest out of which the leasehold interests were carved , the subject matter of the gift made by Lady Ingram was the property shorn of those leasehold interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
182	187	In deciding whether or not this could be said two things appear to me to be of cardinal importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
182	188	First Lady Ingram never intended to give the property to the trustees and beneficiaries free from the leasehold interests which it is common ground that she had . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
182	189	Secondly the creation and existence of these leasehold interests was not in any way dependent upon the concurrence of the trustees and beneficiaries , still less upon the performance by them of some positive act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
182	190	In terms of substance , Lady Ingram had her leasehold interests from the very same moment that the trustees and beneficiaries had the property subject to those interests . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
182	191	In the Court of Appeal Nourse and Evans L.JJ . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
182	192	held -LRB- Millett L.J. dissenting -RRB- , first , that the leases purportedly granted by Mr. MacFadyen to Lady Ingram were a nullity but , secondly , following the obiter dictum of the Court of Appeal in In re Nichols decd . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
182	193	-LSB- 1975 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 534 , 543C , they held that the leasehold interest was comprised in the gift itself and was a part of it , so that Lady Ingram 's equitable right to the leasehold constituted a reservation from the gift for her benefit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
182	194	In his dissenting judgment Millett L.J. held that a nominee may grant an effective lease to his principal and accordingly that the leases granted by Mr. MacFadyen to Lady Ingram were valid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
182	195	In consequence Lady Ingram created two separate interests in the property and made a gift of only one of them which was the freehold reversion subject to the lease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
182	196	In addition Millett L.J. went on to consider the case on the footing that the leases were invalid and stated that the beneficiaries were given only what was left after the trustees had fulfilled their equitable obligation to grant the leases to Lady Ingram . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
182	197	Therefore the property given was enjoyed to the entire exclusion of Lady Ingram . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
182	198	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
182	199	even if the leases granted by Mr. MacFadyen were a nullity , I consider that the gift did not fall within section 102 for the reasons stated by Ferris J . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
182	200	These reasons have to be considered in the context of the conflicting opinions of Walton J. and the Court of Appeal in In re Nichols decd . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
182	201	on the question whether a donor can make a gift of the freehold shorn of the leasehold interest which he retains and which never comprises part of the property which he gives . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
182	202	In the High Court -LSB- 1974 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 296 , 299D Walton J. stated : `` If I consider the matter in principle , it appears to me that if a donor D conveys property to a trustee T to hold upon trust as to some interest therein for a beneficiary B and as to the remainder of the property for the donor D himself , all that the donor has given to the beneficiary is the property shorn of the rights to be held in trust for D . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
182	203	So that , for example , if in Lang v. Webb -LRB- 1912 -RRB- 13 C.L.R. 503 Mrs. Henrietta Lang had conveyed the land to a trustee upon trust to grant thereout a lease back to herself , and subject thereto to hold the various parcels of land upon trust for the sons absolutely , I do not think it could have been seriously argued that in each case the gift made by her was other than a gift of the reversion only . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
182	204	The case would be indistinguishable from Munro v. Commissioner of Stamp Duties -LRB- N.S.W. -RRB- -LSB- 1934 -RSB- A.C. 61 , a decision of the Privy Council . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
182	205	Now , suppose that there is no intermediate trustee , but that B takes the property directly but burdened with the equitable obligation to grant the lease back . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
182	206	Does this make any difference ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
182	207	In my opinion , the answer must be in the negative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
182	208	For in such a case , in very truth , B takes the property as trustee , and the coincidence in identity of B and T can not make any real difference to the legal analysis . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
182	209	And at p. 300H : `` Now , both the speech of Lord Radcliffe -LSB- in St. Aubyn v. Attorney General -RSB- and the passages I have cited from Dymond 's Death Duties -LSB- 15th ed. , -LRB- 1973 -RRB- , p. 358 -RSB- are encrusted with the language of the statute with which I have not so far dealt , but I think it is quite plain from such speech and such comments that there is no legal impediment to regarding simultaneous transactions -LRB- e.g. conveyance and reservation of rent charge , conveyance and lease back -RRB- as only giving the donee the property as so charged in the one case , or the reversion expectant on the lease in the other case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
182	210	Equity , of course , looks upon that as done which ought to be done , so that if there is an immediate equitable obligation upon the donee to grant a lease back , this can , in equity , be looked upon as if it had happened at the very moment of the conveyance itself . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
182	211	But in its judgment , delivered by Goff J. , the Court of Appeal stated at -LSB- 1975 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 534 , 543 : `` Having thus reviewed the authorities , we return to the question what was given , and we think that a grant of the fee simple , subject to and with the benefit of a lease back , where such grant is made by a person who owns the whole freehold free from any lease , is a grant of the whole fee simple with something reserved out of it , and not a gift of a partial interest leaving something in the hands of the grantor which he has not given . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
182	212	It is not like a reversion or remainder expectant on a prior interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
182	213	It gives an immediate right to the rent , together with a right to distrain for it , and , if there be a proviso for re-entry , a right to forfeit the lease . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
182	214	Of course , where , as in Munro v. Commissioner of Stamp Duties -LRB- N.S.W. -RRB- -LSB- 1934 -RSB- A.C. 61 , the lease , or , as it then may have been , a licence coupled with an interest , arises under a prior independent transaction , no question can arise because the donor then gives all that he has , but where it is a condition of the gift that a lease back shall be created , we think that must , on a true analysis , be a reservation of a benefit out of the gift and not something not given at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
182	215	In our judgment , however , it is not necessary to reach a final conclusion on this point , since there are in our view two unanswerable reasons why this case is caught by the statutory provision , each independent of the other and sufficient in itself . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
182	216	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
182	217	I consider that on this point the opinion of Walton J. , rather than the opinion of the Court of Appeal , was correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
182	218	In my opinion , whether the equitable obligation to grant a lease back to Lady Ingram is regarded as imposed on the trustees or on the beneficiaries , this obligation arose as soon as the freehold vested in the trustees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
182	219	In the present case there never was a time when , in equity , the donees held the property free from the donor 's leasehold interest , and I am in agreement with the observation of Ferris J. at p. 580F that : `` In terms of substance , Lady Ingram had her leasehold interests from the very same moment that the trustees and beneficiaries had the property subject to those interests . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
182	220	As a matter of conveyancing law , the leasehold interest is carved out of the freehold . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
182	221	This point was made by Isaacs J. in Lang v. Webb -LRB- 1912 -RRB- 13 C.L.R. 503 , 515 where he said that the transaction of gift `` had to be complete before the donee could execute to -LRB- the donor -RRB- the lease of the property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
182	222	A lease is a conveyance ; and it is more than form , it is substance , when the donor 's interest has to be vested in the donee before the donee can convey a smaller interest . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
182	223	But in this case , where the equitable obligation arose as soon as the freehold was given to the trustees , to determine the point in accordance with conveyancing law would be to depart from the approach which should be followed and which was stated by Palles C.B. in In re Cochrane -LSB- 1905 -RSB- 2 I.R. 626 , 637 : `` as in these questions of revenue , matters of mere conveyancing form are immaterial ; as we are to view the substance only of the transaction , and as ` gift ' in the context means ` beneficial gift , ' so , too , in the actual case before us , should it be held that the reservation of the ultimate trust to Sir Henry Cochrane can not , per se render the entire capital subject to duty . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
182	224	Accordingly , viewing the substance of the transaction , I consider that what was comprised in the gift made by Lady Ingram was the freehold shorn of the leasehold interest , and section 102 does not apply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
182	225	Therefore in my opinion the appeal should succeed and it becomes unnecessary to decide whether the leases granted by Mr. MacFadyen to Lady Ingram were a nullity , but as this question was argued I state that in my opinion the leases were valid for the reasons fully set out in the judgment of Millett L.J. in the Court of Appeal and I am also in agreement with the observations of my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann on this part of the case . 	lord hutton	self	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
182	225	Therefore in my opinion the appeal should succeed and it becomes unnecessary to decide whether the leases granted by Mr. MacFadyen to Lady Ingram were a nullity , but as this question was argued I state that in my opinion the leases were valid for the reasons fully set out in the judgment of Millett L.J. in the Court of Appeal and I am also in agreement with the observations of my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann on this part of the case . 	lord hutton	lord hoffmann	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
182	226	As I am of opinion that the gift made by Lady Ingram did not come within section 102 even if the leases were a nullity it is unnecessary to consider the Ramsay principle and I do not discuss it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
