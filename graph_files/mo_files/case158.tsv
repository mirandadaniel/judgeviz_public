158	1	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hope
158	2	LORD BINGHAM OF CORNHILL 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hope
158	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hope
158	4	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hope
158	5	In each of the four appeals before the House the appellant is a foreign national who suffered or would suffer persecution for Convention reasons at the place where he lived in the country of his nationality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hope
158	6	Each appellant came to the United Kingdom and here claimed asylum as a refugee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hope
158	7	In each case recognition as a refugee has been denied on the ground that there is another place -LRB- `` the place of relocation '' -RRB- , within the country of the appellant 's nationality , where he would have no well-founded fear of persecution , where the protection of that country would be available to him and where , in all the circumstances , he could reasonably and without undue harshness be expected to live . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hope
158	8	The common issue in the appeals is whether , in judging reasonableness and undue harshness in this context , account should be taken of any disparity between the civil , political and socio-economic human rights which the appellant would enjoy under the leading international human rights conventions and covenants and those which he would enjoy at the place of relocation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hope
158	9	In the appeals of Messrs Hamid , Gaafar and Mohammed a further issue arises , on the approach to be followed where the persecution suffered or to be suffered was or would be sanctioned or connived at by the authorities of the country of the appellants ' nationality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hope
158	10	The answer to those questions must be found in the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees , as amended by the 1967 Protocol , and in such exegesis of the Convention as commands clear international acceptance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hope
158	11	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hope
158	12	I am indebted to my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead , whose comprehensive summary of the facts of the four cases enables me to be very brief on that aspect . 	lord bingham	lord hope	factagr	0	lord bingham, lord hope
158	13	Mr Januzi , an Albanian Kosovar , was the victim of ethnic cleansing at Serb hands at his home in Mitrovica in Kosovo . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hope
158	14	He fled to this country and claimed asylum . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hope
158	15	This claim was refused on the ground that he could reasonably be expected to relocate to Pristina . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hope
158	16	He claims , largely for medical reasons associated with his experience of persecution , that it would be unduly harsh to expect him to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hope
158	17	Messrs Hamid , Gaafar and Mohammed were black Africans living in Darfur in western Sudan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hope
158	18	Hamid and Gaafar were the victims of persecution by marauding Arab bands , which the Government encouraged or connived at and did not restrain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hope
158	19	Mohammed , it has been found , would suffer such persecution were he to return to Darfur , whence -LRB- like Hamid and Gaafar -RRB- he fled . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hope
158	20	They all claimed asylum on arriving here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hope
158	21	In each case , recognition as a refugee has been denied on the ground that the appellant could reasonably -LRB- and without undue harshness -RRB- be expected to relocate to Khartoum . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hope
158	22	They all fear that they might be the victims of adverse discriminatory treatment , even persecution , in Khartoum , and they contend that relocation there would be unreasonable and unduly harsh . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hope
158	23	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	24	As in so many other cases the crux of the argument is found in the amended definition of a `` refugee '' in article 1A -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Refugee Convention as any person who The closing words of the definition , applicable to stateless persons , have no immediate application to the appellants , all of whom have a nationality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	25	In each of their cases the relevant persecution is for reasons of ethnicity , which is a reason falling within the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	26	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	27	This definition must be read as a whole , in the context of the Convention as a whole , taking account of the Convention 's historical setting and its objects and purposes , to be derived from its articles , and also from the recitals of its preamble which are quoted in extenso in R -LRB- European Roma Rights Centre and Others -RRB- v Immigration Officer at Prague Airport and Another -LRB- United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees intervening -RRB- -LSB- 2004 -RSB- UKHL 55 , -LSB- 2005 -RSB- 2 AC 1 , para 6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	28	The Convention must be interpreted as an international instrument , not a domestic statute , in accordance with the rules prescribed in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	29	As a human rights instrument the Convention should not be given a narrow or restricted interpretation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	30	Nonetheless , the starting point of the construction exercise must be the text of the Convention itself -LRB- Adan v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 1 AC 293 , 305 ; Roma Rights case , above , para 18 -RRB- , because it expresses what the parties to it have agreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	31	The parties to an international convention are not to be treated as having agreed something they did not agree , unless it is clear by necessary implication from the text or from uniform acceptance by states that they would have agreed or have subsequently done so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	32	The court has `` no warrant to give effect to what -LSB- states parties -RSB- might , or in an ideal world would , have agreed '' : Roma Rights case , above , para 18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	33	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	34	The definition of `` refugee '' quoted above , as it applies to nationals , has three qualifying conditions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	35	The first is , clearly in my opinion , a causative condition which governs all that follows : `` owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race ... political opinion '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	36	The second , indispensable , condition , satisfied by all these appellants , is that the person should be `` outside the country of his nationality '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	37	The third condition contains an alternative : the person must either be `` unable ... to avail himself of the protection '' of the country of his nationality , or he must be `` unwilling '' , owing to fear of being persecuted for a Convention reason , `` to avail himself of the protection '' of the country of his nationality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	38	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	39	This definition must be read in the light of three familiar and uncontentious but fundamental principles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	40	First , the power to admit , exclude and expel aliens was among the earliest and most widely recognised powers of the sovereign state : see Roma Rights case , paras 11-12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	41	Secondly , a person has no right to live elsewhere than in his country of nationality , and has no right to claim asylum : ibid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	42	Thirdly , a state has an obligation to protect its nationals within its borders against persecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	43	The Refugee Convention , the latest in a series of similar instruments , adopted at a time when many people had been driven by persecution to leave their home countries , accepted the need for some limited relaxation of these principles to recognise the plight of those fleeing from intolerable oppression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	44	But like any international convention it was the product of negotiation and compromise : Adan v Secretary of State for the Home Department , above , p 305 ; Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs -LRB- 1997 -RRB- 190 CLR 225 , 247-248 , 274 ; Rodriguez v United States -LRB- 1987 -RRB- 480 US 522 , 525-526 ; Roma Rights case , above , para 15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	45	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	46	The Refugee Convention does not expressly address the situation at issue in these appeals where , within the country of his nationality , a person has a well-founded fear of persecution at place A , where he lived , but not at place B , where -LRB- it is said -RRB- he could reasonably be expected to relocate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	47	But the situation may fairly be said to be covered by the causative condition to which reference has been made : for if a person is outside the country of his nationality because he has chosen to leave that country and seek asylum in a foreign country , rather than move to a place of relocation within his own country where he would have no well-founded fear of persecution , where the protection of his country would be available to him and where he could reasonably be expected to relocate , it can properly be said that he is not outside the country of his nationality owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for a Convention reason . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	48	Although described by a number of different names this relocation alternative has now been recognised for a number of years , at any rate since publication of paragraph 91 of the United Nations Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees in 1979 : The corollary of this proposition , as is accepted , is that a person will be excluded from refugee status if under all the circumstances it would be reasonable to expect him to seek refuge in another part of the same country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	49	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	50	This reasonableness test of internal relocation was readily and widely accepted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	51	It was applied by the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada in Rasaratnam v Canada -LRB- Minister of Employment and Immigration -RRB- -LSB- 1992 -RSB- 1 FC 706 , 711 and again in Thirunavukkarasu v Canada -LRB- Minister of Employment and Immigration -RRB- -LRB- 1993 -RRB- 109 DLR -LRB- 4th -RRB- 682 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	52	It has been applied in Australia and New Zealand -LRB- see paras 9-10 below -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	53	It is reflected in rule 343 of the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules -LRB- 1994 -RRB- -LRB- HC 395 -RRB- , which provides : The ground of refusal would be that the person is not , within the Convention definition , a refugee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	54	It is not in contention between the parties that reasonableness is the test to be applied when deciding whether a relocation alternative is open to an applicant for asylum . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	55	But the parties are sharply divided on how the test should be applied , and in particular on whether a person can reasonably be expected to relocate when the level of civil , political and socio-economic human rights in the place of relocation is poor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	56	The appellants submit that he can not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	57	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	58	The appellants found their submission on a passage in Professor Hathaway 's respected work The Law of Refugee Status -LRB- 1991 -RRB- , p 134 , where he speaks , as many authorities do , of `` internal protection '' to describe what I am calling `` internal relocation '' : This passage was quoted by Keith J for the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Butler v Attorney-General -LSB- 1999 -RSB- NZAR 205 , para 32 , who went on to hold in para 50 that In Refugee Appeal No 71684/99 -LSB- 2000 -RSB- INLR 165 , the Refugee Status Appeals Authority of New Zealand , while acknowledging in para 57 `` that no uniform and ascertainable standard of rights for refugees has emerged on which States parties to the Refugee Convention are agreed '' , carried the Court of Appeal 's approach a further step . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	59	Having made reference to some of the rights which member states bind themselves to extend to those accepted as refugees , they continued in paras 60-61 : 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	60	This New Zealand authority is perhaps the high water mark of the appellants ' case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	61	But they gain assistance from a similar line of authority in Australia . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	62	In Randhawa v Minister for Immigration , Local Government and Ethnic Affairs -LRB- 1994 -RRB- 52 FCR 437 the Federal Court of Australia cited Professor Hathaway 's observations quoted above with approval : see Black CJ , p 442 ; Beaumont J , pp 450 - 451 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	63	The passage was also cited by Moore J in the same court in Perampalam v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs -LSB- 1999 -RSB- FCA 165 ; -LRB- 1999 -RRB- 84 FCR 274 , 288 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	64	In Al-Amidi v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs -LSB- 2000 -RSB- FCA 1081 ; -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 177 ALR 506 , 510 , it was stressed , citing Professor Hathaway , that `` there must be satisfaction of the basic norms of civil , political and socio-economic human rights in that relocation '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	65	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	66	The appellants place particular reliance on a passage in the judgment of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex p Robinson -LSB- 1998 -RSB- QB 929 , 939-940 , where the court said : The court 's approach to test -LRB- d -RRB- has not been found to be wholly clear -LRB- see H Storey , `` The Internal Flight Alternative Test : The Jurisprudence Re-examined , '' -LRB- 1998 -RRB- 10 International Journal of Refugee Law , 499 , 529 -RRB- , and when one of the authors of the Robinson judgment came to summarise its effect in Karanakaran v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 3 All ER 449 , 470 he made no reference to the level of civil , political and socio-economic human rights in the place of relocation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	67	But on its face Robinson appears to lend support to the appellants ' argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	68	Support is also derived from the conclusions of the expert roundtable organised by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Institute of Humanitarian Law in San Remo in September 2001 : the level of respect for human rights in the proposed place of relocation was in their opinion relevant to an assessment of its availability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	69	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	70	Canadian authority reveals a somewhat different approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	71	In Thirunavukkarasu v Minister of Employment and Immigration , above , Professor Hathaway 's observations already quoted were cited and described as helpful , but were held not quite to achieve `` the appropriate balance between the purposes of international protection for refugees and the availability of an internal -LSB- relocation -RSB- alternative '' : p 687 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	72	In a passage of Linden JA 's judgment which has been much quoted -LRB- as , briefly , by the Court of Appeal in Robinson -RRB- , it was held at pp 687-688 , using the expression `` IFA '' to mean what I have called the `` relocation alternative '' : In Ranganathan v Canada -LRB- Minister of Citizenship and Immigration -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 2 FC 164 , the Federal Court of Appeal -LRB- per Létourneau JA , with the assent of his colleagues -RRB- said , with reference to Thirunavukkarasu : 13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	73	In England and Wales , the Court of Appeal in E and another v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2003 -RSB- EWCA 1032 , -LSB- 2004 -RSB- QB 531 declined to adopt what may , without disrespect , be called the Hathaway/New Zealand rule . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	74	It was argued for the appellants in that case -LRB- see para 16 of the judgment of the court given by Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR -RRB- that In paragraphs 23-24 of its judgment the court said The court cited Professor Hathaway 's observations quoted above , and also a passage in Professor Goodwin-Gill 's work on The Refugee in International Law , 2nd ed -LRB- 1996 -RRB- , p 74 , and continued in paragraph 38 : The court considered the leading authorities in Canada , New Zealand and this country -LRB- including Robinson , which it declined to follow on somewhat questionable grounds : para 66 -RRB- , but was not persuaded to a different view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	75	It concluded , in paragraph 67 : 14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	76	The Court of Appeal 's approach in E does not reflect , but nor does it contradict , a consensus of expert international opinion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	77	The Michigan Guidelines treat the condition of compliance with widely recognised international human rights in the place of relocation as one for which `` Good reasons may be advanced '' : Hathaway , `` International Refugee Law : The Michigan Guidelines on the Internal Protection Alternative '' , 1999 , para 21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	78	In a paper prepared in 2001 for the San Remo roundtable , Hathaway and Foster -LRB- `` Internal Protection/Relocation/Flight Alternative as an Aspect of Refugee Status Determination '' , p 43 -RRB- point out that `` The minimum acceptable level of legal rights inherent in the notion of ` protection ' is certainly open to debate '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	79	The contributors to Refugee Protection in International Law , ed Feller , Türk and Nicholson , -LRB- 2003 -RRB- acknowledge that there are differing approaches to this matter : see , for example , pp 23-28 , 405-411 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	80	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	81	There are , in my opinion , a number of reasons why the broad approach of the Court of Appeal in E must be preferred to the Hathaway/New Zealand rule . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	82	First , there is nothing in any article of the Convention from which that rule may by any process of interpretation be derived . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	83	The Convention is addressed to the rights in the country of asylum of those recognised as refugees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	84	It is not explicitly directed to defining the rights in the country of their nationality of claimants for asylum who may be able to relocate within that country in a place where they will have no well-founded fear of persecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	85	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	86	Secondly , acceptance of that rule can not properly be implied into the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	87	It is of course true , as the appellants emphasise , that the preamble to the Convention invokes the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , and seeks to assure refugees the widest possible exercise of the fundamental rights and freedoms affirmed in those documents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	88	But the thrust of the Convention is to ensure the fair and equal treatment of refugees in countries of asylum , so as to provide effective protection against persecution for Convention reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	89	It was not directed -LRB- persecution apart -RRB- to the level of rights prevailing in the country of nationality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	90	The article on refugees in the Universal Declaration was authoritatively criticised in 1948 as `` artificial to the point of flippancy '' -LRB- see Roma Rights case , above , para 14 -RRB- , and influential though the Declaration has been it lacked any means of enforcement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	91	The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966 and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights 1966 , compendiously referred to as `` the International Bill of Rights '' , are in truth not such , and had yet to be adopted when the Convention was made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	92	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	93	Thirdly , this rule is not expressed in Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 -LRB- OJ L 304.12 -RRB- on `` minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	94	This is an important instrument , because it is binding on member states of the European Union who could not , consistently with their obligations under the Convention , have bound themselves to observe a standard lower than it required . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	95	Article 8 provides in paragraphs 1 and 2 : This imposes a standard significantly lower than the rule would require . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	96	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	97	Fourthly , as appears from the sources cited above , the rule is not , currently , supported by such uniformity of international practice based on legal obligation and such consensus of professional and academic opinion as would be necessary to establish a rule of customary international law : Roma Rights case , above , para 23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	98	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	99	Fifthly , adoption of the rule would give the Convention an effect which is not only unintended but also anomalous in its consequences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	100	Suppose a person is subject to persecution for Convention reasons in the country of his nationality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	101	It is a poor country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	102	Standards of social provision are low . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	103	There is a high level of deprivation and want . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	104	Respect for human rights is scant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	105	He escapes to a rich country where , if recognised as a refugee , he would enjoy all the rights guaranteed to refugees in that country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	106	He could , with no fear of persecution , live elsewhere in his country of nationality , but would there suffer all the drawbacks of living in a poor and backward country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	107	It would be strange if the accident of persecution were to entitle him to escape , not only from that persecution , but from the deprivation to which his home country is subject . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	108	It would , of course , be different if the lack of respect for human rights posed threats to his life or exposed him to the risk of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	109	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	110	I would accordingly reject the appellants ' challenge to the authority of E and dismiss all four appeals so far as they rest on that ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	111	It is , however , important , given the immense significance of the decisions they have to make , that decision-makers should have some guidance on the approach to reasonableness and undue harshness in this context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	112	Valuable guidance is found in the UNHCR Guidelines on International Protection of 23 July 2003 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	113	In paragraph 7 II -LRB- a -RRB- the reasonableness analysis is approached by asking `` Can the claimant , in the context of the country concerned , lead a relatively normal life without facing undue hardship ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	114	and the comment is made : `` If not , it would not be reasonable to expect the person to move there '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hope
158	115	In development of this analysis the guidelines address respect for human rights in paragraph 28 : They then address economic survival in paragraphs 29-30 : These guidelines are , I think , helpful , concentrating attention as they do on the standards prevailing generally in the country of nationality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	116	Helpful also is a passage on socio-economic factors in Storey , op cit , p 516 -LRB- footnotes omitted -RRB- : 21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	117	In arguing , on behalf of Messrs Hamid , Gaafar and Mohammed , that internal relocation is never an available option where persecution is by the authorities of the country of nationality , Mr Gill QC gains support from the conclusions of the San Remo experts in 2001 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	118	They considered that where the risk of being persecuted emanates from the State -LRB- including the national government and its agents -RRB- internal relocation `` is not normally a relevant consideration as it can be presumed that the State is entitled to act throughout the country of origin '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	119	The UNHCR Guidelines of July 2003 similarly observe -LRB- para 7 I -LRB- b -RRB- -RRB- : There can , however , be no absolute rule and it is , in my opinion , preferable to avoid the language of presumption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	120	The decision-maker , taking account of all relevant circumstances pertaining to the claimant and his country of origin , must decide whether it is reasonable to expect the claimant to relocate or whether it would be unduly harsh to expect him to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	121	The source of the persecution giving rise to the claimant 's well-founded fear in his place of ordinary domicile may be agents of the state authorised or directed by the state to persecute ; or they may be agents of the state whose persecution is connived at or tolerated by the state , or not restrained by the state ; or the persecution may be by those who are not agents of the state , but whom the state does not or can not control . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	122	These sources of persecution may , of course , overlap , and it may on the facts be hard to identify the source of the persecution complained of or feared . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	123	There is , as Simon Brown LJ aptly observed in Svazas v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2002 -RSB- EWCA Civ 74 -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 WLR 1891 , para 55 , a spectrum of cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	124	The decision-maker must do his best to decide , on such material as is available , where on the spectrum the particular case falls . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	125	The more closely the persecution in question is linked to the state , and the greater the control of the state over those acting or purporting to act on its behalf , the more likely -LRB- other things being equal -RRB- that a victim of persecution in one place will be similarly vulnerable in another place within the state . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	126	The converse may also be true . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope

158	142	The question in these appeals arises under article 1A -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees as amended by the 1967 Protocol -LRB- `` the Refugee Convention '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	143	It relates to the approach that is to be taken to the claim to refugee status by an applicant who has a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason in one part of the country to which it is proposed to return him and there is another part of the country -LRB- `` the place of relocation '' , as my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill has described it -RRB- where there is no such well-founded fear . 	lord hope	lord bingham	partagr	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	144	The question in each case is whether it is unreasonable , in the sense that it would be unduly harsh , for the applicant to be expected to relocate internally within that country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	145	That in its turn raises the question as to the tests that are to be applied in order to determine whether in the appellants ' cases that alternative is available . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	146	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	147	The appellant Mr Januzi is an ethnic Albanian from Kosovo . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	148	The appellants Messrs Hamid , Gaafa and Mohammed are all black Africans from the Darfur region in Sudan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	149	One issue is common to all these appeals , as Lord Bingham has explained . 	lord hope	lord bingham	partagr	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	150	This is whether the quality of life in the place of relocation must meet the basic norms of civil , political and socio-economic rights before relocation there can be said to be reasonable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	151	The appeals of Messrs Hamid , Gaafar and Mohammed raise an additional question about the approach that is to be taken to this issue where the persecution of which the person has a well-founded fear for a Convention reason in the country of his nationality has been sanctioned or connived in by the State or by its agents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	152	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	153	During the course of the hearing before your Lordships the Secretary of State indicated that he was willing to agree to the cases of Mr Hamid and Mr Gaafar being remitted to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal on the ground that the determinations in these cases were inadequately reasoned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	154	He did not agree to Mr Mohammed 's case being remitted , and the facts in the cases of Mr Hamid and Mr Gaafar form part of the broader picture in the light of which the questions of law raised by all these cases must be considered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	155	So I shall give a brief account of the facts of each of them before dealing with the points of law which they have raised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	156	Mr Januzi 's case 27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	157	Gzim Januzi is an ethnic Albanian from the Kosovo province of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	158	He was born in the village of Mazhiq , near Mitrovica , on 6 May 1977 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	159	This is an area of Kosovo in which persons of Albanian extraction are in the minority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hope
158	160	He is the eldest of five children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	161	His family had land and livestock , from which they earned a livelihood . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	162	In the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s the Serbian government in Belgrade instituted a systematic policy of Serb domination of Serbia and Montenegro and Serbianisation of the ethnic Albanian enclave of Kosovo . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	163	In Gashi and Nikshiqi v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 1997 -RSB- INLR 96 the Immigration Appeal Tribunal held that there was in place within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia a policy of ethnic cleansing against Albanians by Serbs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	164	For a period from July 1996 it was accepted by the Secretary of State that asylum seekers who were accepted as being ethnic Albanians from that country were entitled to refugee status . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	165	In March 1999 international peace-keeping forces intervened in Kosovo . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	166	By June of that year the province had been brought under control . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope

158	168	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	169	Mr Januzi 's family , like most Albanian families in the area , experienced the severe effects of the ethnic cleansing policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	170	His father was a member of the Democratic League of Kosovo -LRB- `` the LDK '' -RRB- , a political party seeking to advance the rights of the ethnic Albanian population in Kosovo . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	171	He himself was a supporter , but not a member , of that party and attended demonstrations in Pristina and Mitrovica . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	172	His father was imprisoned by the Serbian authorities for his activities in support of the LDK , and he himself was detained by them on three occasions during the 1990s . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	173	He claimed in his asylum statement that on each of these occasions he was ill-treated by the Serbian police when he was in their custody . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	174	He was sent abroad for safety during a period of intensive and increasing persecution in 1998 of the Albanian minority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	175	He reached the United Kingdom and applied for asylum on his arrival here on 17 May 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	176	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	177	The Secretary of State accepted in his decision letter that Mr Januzi came from a majority Serb area of Kosovo and that , as an ethnic Albanian , he was at risk of being exposed to persecution there from which he would not be protected by the authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	178	His position however was that Mr Januzi would not be at risk from Serbs in many other parts of the province , as 95 % of the population of Kosovo was Albanian . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	179	About 90 % of the ethnic Albanians who had fled Kosovo in 1998 and 1999 had already returned to the province voluntarily . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	180	His argument was that Mr Januzi would be safe if he went , for instance , to Pristina , which is about 35 km from his home town of Mitrovica and in an area of Kosovo where ethnic Albanians are in the majority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	181	He said in his decision letter that he considered that , as Mr Januzi was a single man in good health , it would not be unduly harsh to expect him to relocate to one of the many municipalities where very few Serbs were present . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	182	Mr Januzi 's appeal to the adjudicator was allowed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	183	In the Secretary of State 's appeal to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal -LRB- `` the tribunal '' -RRB- Mr Januzi claimed that relocation would not be a reasonable alternative in his case and that he should be accorded refugee status in this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	184	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	185	Mr Januzi 's case before the tribunal , as it had been before the adjudicator , was based on a medical report prepared by Dr James Barrett , a consultant psychiatrist with West London Mental Health NHS Trust and an honorary clinical senior lecturer at the Imperial College of Science and Medicine . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	186	He described the effect on Mr Januzi 's mental health were he to be returned to Kosovo . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	187	He had examined him in November 2001 at Charing Cross Hospital . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	188	In his opinion Mr Januzi was currently suffering from a moderate depressive episode with somatic symptoms for which he required treatment , the causes of which in his opinion were psychological . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	189	He said that returning to Kosovo would be a negative step , as he had had the symptoms for more than a year . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	190	They were liable to become chronic and to worsen by a return to the precipitating environment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	191	In a supplementary report he said that there would be a strong risk of his developing more symptoms of depression which in due course would become severe , with a strong risk of death by self-neglect or suicide . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	192	In a letter which he wrote after the hearing he made it clear that these comments had been written on the assumption that Mr Januzi might be returned to anywhere in Kosovo , as he knew of no reason why Mitrovica should be particularly different from anywhere else in Kosovo . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	193	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	194	The tribunal had before it a paper issued by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees -LRB- UNHCR -RRB- in March 2001 stating her position on the continued protection needs of individuals from Kosovo . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	195	In this paper it is stated that UNHCR considers that some vulnerable people may deserve exemption from forced return on humanitarian grounds -LRB- not , it should be noted , on the ground that this would be a breach of the Refugee Convention -RRB- until special and co-ordinated arrangements could be made to facilitate this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	196	Among these groups are chronically ill persons whose condition requires specialised medical intervention of the type not yet available in Kosovo . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	197	Access to medical treatment by internally displaced persons is limited for anything beyond basic or emergency medical services by the fact that payment is required at the time of treatment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	198	In a United Nations briefing note on the repatriation of Kosovar Albanians issued in April 2001 it was stated that psychiatric services in Kosovo are very limited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	199	There is an almost total lack of community services , the ratio of psychiatrists is one for every 100,000 inhabitants , clinical psychologists are almost non-existent and few psychiatrists have been trained in psychotherapy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	200	The province does not possess any facilities for treating either acute mental health cases or persons who need to be detained or forcibly medicated for mental health reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope

158	202	On the other hand in a municipal profile of the municipality of Pristina prepared by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe 's Mission in Kosovo -LRB- OSCE -RRB- in July 2000 it is stated that Pristina hosts the largest hospital in Kosovo which is currently under international management , and that the neuro-psychiatry department of the clinical centre of the University of Pristina has 144 employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	203	An assessment of the situation of ethnic minorities in Kosovo during the period from October 2000 to February 2001 which was prepared jointly by UNHCR and OSCE and issued in March 2001 refers to intensive efforts on the part of the international community to service the needs of Kosovo Albanians . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope
158	204	It appears from this report that it is Kosovo Serbs who continue to experience the most acute problems in accessing health care at all levels . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hope

158	206	On 12 July 2002 the tribunal issued their determination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	207	In para 16 of the determination they said that , while it would be difficult for Mr Januzi to readjust to life in Kosovo , they were not satisfied that it would be unduly harsh for him to be returned to Pristina . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	208	They found that there were facilities available for treatment there which were adequate for him , and they were not satisfied on the evidence that his return to Kosovo would precipitate a deterioration in his condition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	209	They took into account the fact that many thousands of Kosovans had returned and that GPs in the area would be familiar with dealing with problems of returnees who would have faced ill-treatment at the hands of the Serbs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	210	They were not satisfied that he could not receive appropriate counselling or that adequate medication would not be available for him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	211	Although he might be isolated in Pristina , there would be many individuals there in circumstances like his . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope

158	214	On 24 July 2003 the Court of Appeal -LRB- Aldous , Buxton and May LJJ -RRB- held , in agreement with the tribunal , that there were no grounds for relief under the Refugee Convention : -LSB- 2003 -RSB- EWCA Civ 1188 , para 30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope

158	219	He seeks asylum on the ground that he has a well-founded fear for reasons of race . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	220	He claims that he is a member of the Zaghawa tribe from the village of Oro in west Darfur . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	221	He says that in November 2003 his village was attacked by the Janjaweed militia . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	222	His father and brother were killed in this attack . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope

158	224	But in October 2004 this village too was attacked by the Janjaweed and his mother was killed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	225	He then went to the village of Al Shyria where he met an agent who arranged for him to leave the country , which he did in October 2004 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	226	He reached the United Kingdom and claimed asylum on his arrival here on 22 November 2004 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	227	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	228	The Secretary of State resisted Mr Hamid 's claim by letter dated 19 January 2005 on the ground that the responses he gave to questions when he was interviewed indicated to the asylum caseworker that his account of his place of origin was not genuine . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	229	The caseworker did not believe that Mr Hamid was from Darfur . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	230	So she did not accept that he would be at risk of being killed or subjected to any other ill-treatment if he returned to Sudan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	231	She held that he did not have a well-founded fear of persecution in Sudan on the grounds of his race . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	232	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	233	Mr Hamid 's case was reconsidered by an adjudicator on 16 March 2005 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	234	She accepted his account of his origins and background and of what had happened to him in Sudan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	235	She concluded that he had established that he had suffered persecution because of his ethnicity and that he would be at risk if he were to return to his home area . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	236	But she said that if he were to be returned to Sudan he would arrive at Khartoum . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	237	In her opinion he could remain there , as this was an area of his country where he would not have a well-founded fear of persecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	238	In reaching this decision she followed the reasoning of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal in MM -LRB- Zaghawa - Risk on Return - internal Flight -RRB- -LRB- Sudan -RRB- -LSB- 2005 -RSB- UKIAT 00069 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	239	She relied on the fact that he had no history of political involvement and was not a student . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	240	She said that , given the numbers of displaced people in Khartoum and their diverse ethnicity , there was no reason to think that he would be treated with suspicion and prejudice by the local security forces and there was no real likelihood of a risk of persecution or of treatment contrary to article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	241	She accepted that he had lost his family in Darfur and had had to flee the Janjaweed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	242	But there was no evidence that he faced any health issues and , as he was aged 32 , he was neither very young nor old . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope
158	243	So , while it might well be difficult and even harsh for him to relocate in Sudan , it would not be unduly harsh for him to do so in the circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hope

158	311	On 25 October 2005 the Court of Appeal -LRB- Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers CJ , Maurice Kay LJ and Sir Christopher Staughton -RRB- held that no error of law had been identified in the determinations and dismissed the appeals : -LSB- 2005 -RSB- EWCA Civ 1219 .

158	312	In para 42 of the court 's judgment Maurice Kay LJ said , on the issue of asylum , that there was no general principle or presumption that persecution by or on behalf of the state is incompatible with acceptable internal relocation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	313	The court held that on both asylum and human rights grounds the decisions were entirely compatible with the country guidance contained in AE -LRB- Relocation - Darfur - Khartoum an option -RRB- Sudan CG -LSB- 2005 -RSB- UKIAT 00101 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	314	The issues of law 45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	315	I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill . 	lord hope	lord bingham	ackn	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	316	For the reasons that he has given , with which I am in full agreement , I too would hold that the question whether it would be unduly harsh for a claimant to be expected to live in a place of relocation within the country of his nationality is not to be judged by considering whether the quality of life in the place of relocation meets the basic norms of civil , political and socio-economic human rights . 	lord hope	lord bingham	fullagr	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	317	46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	318	There is , as Lord Bingham points out , no basis for such a test in the wording of article 1A -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Refugee Convention . 	lord hope	lord bingham	partagr	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	319	The principal objection to it is that it invites a comparison between the conditions which prevail in the place of relocation and those which prevail in the country in which asylum is sought . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	320	The conditions that prevail in the country in which asylum is sought have no part to play , as a matter of legal obligation binding on all states parties to the Convention , in deciding whether the claimant is entitled to seek asylum in that country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	321	The extent of the agreement to which the states committed themselves is to be found in the language which they chose to give formal expression to their agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	322	The language itself is the starting point : see Adan v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 1 AC 293 , 305D-E , per Lord Lloyd of Berwick . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	323	A successful claimant will , of course , be entitled to all the benefits that are set out in articles 2 to 34 of the Convention without discrimination as to race , religion or country of origin : see article 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	324	But to become entitled to those benefits the claimant must first show that he is entitled to the status of a `` refugee '' as defined in article 1A -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	325	At this stage , if the possibility of internal relocation is raised , the relevant comparisons are between those in the place of relocation and those that prevail elsewhere in the country of his nationality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	326	As the Court of Appeal said in E and another v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2004 -RSB- QB 531 , para 67 , the comparison between the asylum-seeker 's situation in this country and what it will be in the place of relocation is not relevant for this purpose , though it may be very relevant when considering the impact of the European Convention on Human Rights or the requirements of humanity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	327	47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	328	The question where the issue of internal relocation is raised can , then , be defined quite simply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	329	As Linden JA put it in Thirunavukkarasu v Canada -LRB- Minister of Employment and Immigration -RRB- -LRB- 1993 -RRB- 109 DLR -LRB- 4th -RRB- 682 , 687 , it is whether it would be unduly harsh to expect a claimant who is being persecuted for a Convention reason in one part of his country to move to a less hostile part before seeking refugee status abroad . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	330	The words `` unduly harsh '' set the standard that must be met for this to be regarded as unreasonable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	331	If the claimant can live a relatively normal life there judged by the standards that prevail in his country of nationality generally , and if he can reach the less hostile part without undue hardship or undue difficulty , it will not be unreasonable to expect him to move there . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	332	48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	333	Care must , of course , be taken not to allow the argument that there is an internal relocation option to defeat the basic purposes of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	334	That is why there is a further question that must be considered where the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason which is due to action taken , or threatened to be taken , against him by the state or by state agents within the country of his nationality and it is suggested that he could reasonably be expected to live in a place of relocation there . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	335	The dangers of a return to a country where the state is in full control of events and its agents of persecution are active everywhere within its borders are obvious . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	336	It hardly needs to be said that in such a case internal relocation is not an option that is available . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	337	Remoteness of the suggested place of relocation from the place of origin will provide no answer to the claimant 's assertion that he has a well-founded fear of persecution throughout the country of his nationality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	338	49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	339	On the other hand control of events by the state may be so fragmented , or its activities may be being conducted in such a way , that it will be possible to identify places within its territory where there are no grounds for thinking that persecution by the state or its agents of the claimant for a Convention reason will be resorted to . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	340	A civil war may take that pattern where the extent of it is localised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	341	So too may the process of ethnic cleansing affecting people of the claimant 's ethnicity which is in progress in one area but not in others . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hope
158	342	The state may be ruthless in its attempts to move people of a given ethnicity out of one area . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	343	But it may be benign in its treatment of them when they reach an area which it regards as appropriate for people of that ethnicity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	344	Of course , one kind of brutality may lead to another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	345	Those who object to the state 's policy may be treated differently from those who do not , wherever they happen to be for the time being . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	346	And those who move to a safe area may be at risk of being forced to move back again . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	347	The situation in the country of the claimant 's nationality may be so unstable , or the persecution which the state condones in one place may be so difficult to limit to a given area , that it would be quite unreasonable to expect the claimant to relocate anywhere within its territory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	348	50 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	349	In practice the tribunal tries to provide guidance as to how cases that originate from areas of particular difficulty should be dealt with . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	350	The country guidance cases that have already been mentioned seek to achieve this result : see AB -LRB- return of Southern Sudanese -RRB- Sudan CG -LSB- 2004 -RSB- UKIAT 00260 ; MM -LRB- Zaghawa - Risk on Return - internal Flight -RRB- -LRB- Sudan -RRB- -LSB- 2005 -RSB- UKIAT 00069 ; AE -LRB- Relocation - Darfur - Khartoum an option -RRB- Sudan CG -LSB- 2005 -RSB- UKIAT 00101 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	351	Where this is done , that guidance should be followed by immigration judges . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	352	It is desirable that they should do so in the interests of fairness and consistency . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	353	But in the end of the day each case , whether or not such guidance is available , must depend on an objective and fair assessment of its own facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	354	51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope

158	356	Disposal in Mr Januzi 's case 52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	357	The situation in Kosovo is sufficiently stable for internal relocation to be regarded as a realistic alternative for an ethnic Albanian who is exposed to persecution in a part of the province where people of his ethnicity are in the minority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	358	Mr Blake QC for Mr Januzi did not challenge this proposition in its application to ethnic Albanians in general . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	359	He raised a problem that is particular to Mr Januzi 's own case , in view of the prospect that his already fragile mental health would deteriorate if he were to return to Kosovo . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	360	He submitted that the evidence showed that conditions for the medical treatment that he would need in the place of relocation are below the standards for the provision of basic norms of civil , political and socio-economic rights that are regarded as acceptable internationally . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	361	His case is that it would be unduly harsh , in the context of an untreated severe psychological distress , for Mr Januzi to be required to live in a place where he has no family or friends or community ties , no independent means of subsistence and no prospect of gainful employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	362	The submission that account should be taken of the extent to which conditions in Pristina fall below those which are regarded internationally as acceptable was an essential step in that argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	363	53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	364	The Court of Appeal followed the guidance that was to be found in E and another v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2004 -RSB- QB 531 , para 67 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	365	They confined their attention to the situation in the country of Mr Januzi 's nationality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	366	The evidence showed that the difficulties , both in terms of their likely effect on him and also of the availability of treatment for his mental condition should it deteriorate , extended throughout Kosovo . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	367	There was nothing to show that the problems that he would face in obtaining accommodation and enjoying other civil , political or socio-economic rights were not a pan-Kosovo problem also . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	368	In a judgment with which the other members of the court agreed , Buxton LJ noted that in Karanakaran -LRB- Nalliah -RRB- v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 3 All ER 449 , 456 Brooke LJ described the test of undue harshness as a very rigorous one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	369	But in his judgment it was clear that , applying any sort of rigorous test , relocation was an option that was available to Mr Januzi . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	370	54 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	371	Once it is accepted , as in my opinion it must be , that a comparison between the basic norms of civil , political and socio-economic rights that are regarded as acceptable internationally and the situation in Kosovo is not relevant , the argument that there was a defect in the Court of Appeal 's reasoning in Mr Januzi 's case falls away . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	372	I would wish to sound a note of caution on one point only . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	373	In para 28 of his judgment Buxton LJ said that conditions which extend throughout Kosovo are irrelevant because they apply in both places and can not be taken into account in the balance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	374	I would prefer to put the point that he was making differently . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	375	It is the fact that there is a difference between the standards that apply throughout the country of the claimant 's nationality and those that are regarded as acceptable internationally , and this fact only , that is irrelevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	376	The fact that the same conditions apply throughout the country of the claimant 's nationality is not irrelevant to the question whether the conditions in that country generally as regards the most basic of human rights that are universally recognised - the right to life , and the right not to be subjected to cruel or inhuman treatment - are so bad that it would be unduly harsh for the claimant to have to seek a place of relocation there . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	377	As Mr Rabinder Singh QC for the Secretary of State observed , one does not need to rely on the European Convention on Human Rights to conclude that if conditions are that bad relocation there would be unduly harsh . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	378	But the evidence about the conditions in Kosovo on which Mr Blake relies does not begin to approach that standard . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	379	I would dismiss Mr Januzi 's appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	380	Disposal in the cases of Messrs Hamid , Gaafar and Mohammed 55 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	381	As already mentioned , the Secretary of State has agreed that the cases of Mr Hamid and Mr Gaafar should be remitted to the tribunal for reconsideration on the ground that the adjudicators ' determinations in these cases were inadequately reasoned , even applying the test for internal relocation set out in E and another v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2004 -RSB- QB 531 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	382	The determination in Mr Mohammed 's case , in regard to which the Secretary of State has not made the same concession , was more carefully reasoned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	383	It turned to a large extent on the adjudicator 's assessment of his credibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	384	Mr Gill QC rightly did not seek to rely on those parts of Mr Mohammed 's evidence that the adjudicator did not accept as credible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	385	56 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	386	Mr Gill directed his argument instead to the situation which Mr Mohammed would face if , as the adjudicator had accepted was a possibility , he had to go to a camp on his return to Khartoum . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	387	He said that the consequences of this had not been properly analysed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hope
158	388	He challenged the tribunal 's conclusion in AE -LRB- Relocation - Darfur - Khartoum an option -RRB- Sudan CG -LSB- 2005 -RSB- UKIAT 00101 , para 35 , following its review of various background papers , that there was no evidence to suggest that any individual member of an African tribe from Darfur would automatically be at risk on return to Khartoum or as an internally displaced person in or around Khartoum .

158	389	He pointed out that the case of AB -LRB- return of Southern Sudanese -RRB- Sudan CG -LSB- 2004 -RSB- UKIAT 00260 to which the tribunal had referred in para 19 of its judgment in AE provided country guidance for people from Southern Sudan , not people from Darfur , and that the tribunal in that case had relied on documentation which was significantly out of date such as the US Department of State Report of 2003 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	390	He submitted that it was clear from more up to date material that internally displaced persons are discriminated against in Khartoum , that asylum-seekers who return there are subjected to questioning and risk detention and ill-treatment at numerous points thereafter and that conditions of life for those who have to live in the camps are so bad that there is a real risk of their being forced back to Darfur . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	391	57 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	392	These submissions were supported by reference to extracts from a substantial amount of material which demonstrate the risks that internally displaced persons who have to live in camps are exposed to . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	393	I take this passage from the US Department of State Country Report on Sudan of 2004 , released on 28 February 2005 , as an example : 58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	394	It would be unreasonable to expect adjudicators to have to analyse such a quantity of material in every case , and the adjudicator in Mr Mohammed 's case was not asked to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	395	Much of the argument before him was taken up with an assessment of Mr Mohammed 's claim that he was at risk of persecution because of his involvement with the SLA . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	396	But I think that there are sound reasons for doubting whether the risks to which Mr Mohammed would be exposed in any event if he were to be expected to return to live in a camp in Khartoum were properly explored and analysed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	397	59 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	398	Any assessment of the current situation in Sudan is , of course , beset with uncertainty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	399	Assurances provided by the Sudanese Government about conditions in the camps and voluntary returns of IDPs to their home areas are patently unreliable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	400	The situation is unstable and it is unpredictable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	401	The almost total absence of civil , political and socio-economic rights which those in the camps experience is not in itself , for the reasons already given , a ground for holding that it would be unduly harsh for Mr Mohammed to move to a place of relocation in Khartoum . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	402	It is the risk to his most basic human rights that being required to live there would expose him that requires to be evaluated , as does the risk that sooner or later he will be forced by the state or those acting with its connivance or under its authority to return to Darfur where on the grounds of his ethnicity he would almost certainly be persecuted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	403	An evaluation of those risks may also give rise to other reasons why on humanitarian grounds he should not be required to return to Khartoum . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	404	60 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	405	In my opinion a reassessment of the internal relocation alternative and of the humanitarian considerations under article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights that these risks give rise to is needed in his case , as it is in the cases of Mr Hamid and Mr Gaafar which appear in these respects to be indistinguishable from that of Mr Mohammed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	406	I would allow the appeals of Messrs Hamid , Gaafar and Mohammed and remit all three cases for reconsideration by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal . 	lord hope	self	outcome	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope

158	414	The persecution of minorities and the migration of people seeking refuge from persecution have been unhappily enduring features , which did not end with the conclusion of the Second World War . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	415	In recent years the governments of a number of states have become understandably concerned about the increasing flood of people claiming asylum on the ground of persecution in their own countries and seeking to remain within the borders of the host states . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	416	They have attempted to balance their international obligations and a proper humanitarian approach against their concern that the numbers seeking asylum could not readily be absorbed and that the fears expressed by some at least of the asylum seekers were not sufficiently well founded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	417	The vehicle for doing so has been the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees , as amended -LRB- `` the Convention '' -RRB- , which was the subject of agreement between states over 50 years ago , when the problems of the time inevitably differed in many respects from those prevailing today . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	418	That a means of reaching an accommodation suitable to cater for modern conditions has been achieved is a tribute to the wisdom and humanity of those who have had to construe the terms of the Convention and apply them to multifarious individual cases .

158	419	63 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	420	The issue arising in these appeals , as posed by Lord Bingham and Lord Hope , is how to deal with cases where the asylum seeker has a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason in one part of the country from which he has fled but could be returned to another part , the place of relocation , in which the circumstances are such that he would not have a well-founded fear of being so persecuted . 	lord carswell	lord bingham	partagr	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope

158	421	The proposition that he can properly be returned to a place of relocation is now generally accepted , as my noble and learned friends have set out . 	lord carswell	lord hope	partagr	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	422	Another proposition qualifying that has been developed in recent years , that he should not be returned if it would be unduly harsh sive unreasonable to expect him to relocate in that particular place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	423	64 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	424	It is necessary to relate these propositions to the terms of the Convention , both to give them a principled basis and to define the limits of their operation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	425	As Lord Lloyd of Berwick said in Adan v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 1 AC 293 , 305 , the language itself is the starting point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	426	The material portion of article 1A -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Convention -LRB- as amended -RRB- defines a refugee as any person who It may be seen , as Lord Bingham has pointed out -LRB- para 7 above -RRB- that the text of the Convention does not directly address the issue of return to safe relocation areas . 	lord carswell	lord bingham	partagr	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	427	That persons seeking asylum may be so returned has , however , been recognised for a number of years , as appears from the sources cited by Lord Bingham at paras 7 and 8 of his opinion . 	lord carswell	lord bingham	partagr	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	428	Nor is there any explicit reference to the qualification , whose validity is also generally accepted , that they are not to be returned if to do so would be unduly harsh . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	429	65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	430	Accommodation of these principles has been attempted by two avenues , the choice of which may be critical , for it may lead to different results in individual cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	431	The first is by focusing on the well-founded nature of the fear of the applicant for asylum , the approach of the Court of Appeal at paras 23-24 of its judgment in E and another v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2003 -RSB- EWCA 1032 , -LSB- 2004 -RSB- QB 531 , which your Lordships have approved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	432	On this basis , where there is a safe place of relocation in the applicant 's country , he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution if he returns to that part of his country and therefore does not satisfy the definition of a refugee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	433	Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR , giving the judgment of the court , so expressed it in para 23 : 66 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hope
158	434	The other approach , relied upon by the appellants , is to focus on the words `` is unable ... to avail himself of the protection of that country . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	435	There is some reason to suppose that when the Convention was originally drafted the protection intended in this provision was that furnished in another country by diplomatic or consular authorities : see Fortin , `` The Meaning of ` Protection ' in the Refugee Definition , '' -LRB- 2001 -RRB- 12 International Journal of Refugee Law 548 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	436	Since the temporal provision in article 1A -LRB- 2 -RRB- was removed in 1967 it has not been so interpreted and it may be said that ongoing interpretation of the Convention as a living instrument and adaptation to modern conditions have brought about a shift in meaning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	437	It is argued on this basis that , whether or not the applicant can be said to have a well-founded fear of persecution if he can return to a place of relocation , he is unable to avail himself of the protection of his country if that country fails to provide him with a meaningful degree of protection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	438	The origin of this approach appears to be the work of Professor Hathaway , The Law of Refugee Status -LRB- 1991 -RRB- , in which he says , at p 134 : It has received some support from courts in New Zealand and Australia : see the authorities cited in paras 9 and 10 of Lord Bingham 's opinion . 	lord carswell	lord bingham	partagr	1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	439	67 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	440	For the reasons set out in paras 15 to 19 of Lord Bingham 's opinion I agree that the approach of the Court of Appeal in E 's case is to be preferred to the Hathaway rule accepted in New Zealand . 	lord carswell	lord bingham	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	441	It should be determined by having regard to the part of the definition of a refugee in article 1A -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Convention rather than to the ambit of a country 's `` protection '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	442	This approach gives a principled and workable basis for the return of a person seeking asylum to a place of relocation , if operated on the lines set out in the UNHCR Guidelines on International Protection of 23 July 2003 , set out in para 20 of Lord Bingham 's opinion . 	lord carswell	lord bingham	partagr	1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	443	It is necessary to stress the rigorous nature of the test for unreasonableness or undue harshness , as to which see the judgment of the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal in Ranganathan v Canada -LRB- Minister of Citizenship and Immigration -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 2 FC 164 , quoted by Lord Bingham at para 12 above . 	lord carswell	lord bingham	partagr	1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	444	68 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	445	Applying this test and adopting the reasons given by Lord Hope I would dismiss Mr Januzi 's appeal . 	lord carswell	lord hope	fullagr	1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	445	Applying this test and adopting the reasons given by Lord Hope I would dismiss Mr Januzi 's appeal . 	lord carswell	self	outcome	1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	446	I agree that relocation is an option open to him and that it would not be unduly harsh to require him to resettle in the Pristina area of Kosovo . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	447	69 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	448	The appeals of Messrs Hamid , Gaafar and Mohammed pose rather different questions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hope
158	449	Again , applying the test which I have accepted as correct and adopting the reasons given by Lord Hope in paras 55 to 60 above , I would allow the appeals in their cases and remit all three cases for reconsideration by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal . 	lord carswell	lord hope	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hope
