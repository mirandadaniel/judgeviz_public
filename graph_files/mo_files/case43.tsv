43	15	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord steyn
43	16	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord steyn
43	17	In 1982 Parliament placed a duty on health authorities and local social services authorities to provide after-care services for persons in their areas who have been discharged from compulsory detention under provisions of the Mental Health Act 1959 : section 51 of the Mental Health -LRB- Amendment -RRB- Act 1982 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord steyn
43	18	In the next year this provision became section 117 of the consolidated Mental Health Act 1983 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord steyn
43	19	Although the provision has been on the statute book for nearly 20 years it still is a matter of controversy whether the authorities are legally entitled to charge for after-care services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord steyn
43	20	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord steyn
43	21	The Department of Health has consistently taken the view that health authorities and social services authorities may not charge for services which they render in consequence of their duty under section 117 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord steyn
43	22	A circular under the heading `` Advice Note for Use by Social Services Inspectorate '' issued by the Department of Health in January 1994 dealt with the point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord steyn
43	23	Paragraph 2 reads as follows : `` 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
43	24	Section 117 of the Mental Health Act 1983 imposes duties on local social services authorities and health authorities to provide after-care services -LRB- which may include home care services -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
43	25	Services provided under section 117 of the Mental Health Act 1983 are not subject to charging under section 17 of the 1983 Act . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
43	26	In response to a Parliamentary question in July 1998 the government stated that `` charges can not be levied for services , residential or non-residential , which are provided as part of the programme of after care for a patient under section 117 '' : Hansard Written Answers , 28 July 1998 , col. 172 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
43	27	Nevertheless , there has been for many years confusion on this point among social services authorities and health authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
43	28	The House was told that about two-thirds of the authorities charge for such services and one third do not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
43	29	The question whether such charging is authorised by statute has substantial resource implications . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
43	30	While one views unverified figures with some scepticism , it was said that the annual sum so recovered by authorities was of the order of # 31m and that , if repayment has to be made of charges levied since 1993 , the sum involved may be about # 80m . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
43	31	Higher figures given to the Court of Appeal were apparently wrong : R v Richmond upon Thames London Borough Council , Ex p Watson -LSB- 2001 -RSB- QB 370 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
43	32	Behind these figures lie , no doubt , innumerable tragic personal stories of mentally ill individuals , who were charged for after-care services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
43	33	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
43	34	It has been the policy of successive governments to shift mentally ill patients from the institutional care of the National Health Service to care in the community : - Bridget Dimond , Legal Aspects of Care in the Community , 1997 , p 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
43	35	The point is therefore of great importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
43	36	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
43	37	The three cases before the House all involve mentally ill persons who were formally admitted to hospital under section 3 of the 1983 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
43	38	They were discharged and placed in caring residential accommodation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
43	39	The local social services authorities involved charged them for the provision of after-care services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
43	40	The lawfulness of the decisions to charge by the authorities was challenged in judicial review proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
43	41	In careful judgments delivered by Sullivan J on 28 July 1999 -LRB- -LSB- 2000 -RSB- LGR 318 -RRB- and by the Court of Appeal -LRB- Otton and Buxton LLJ and Hooper J -LSB- 2001 -RSB- QB 370 -RRB- on 27 July 2000 it was ruled that there is no right to charge for after-care services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
43	42	-LRB- Since the decision in the Court of Appeal Mary Watson has died . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
43	43	There are now only three appeals . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
43	44	On appeal to the House the rulings made below have been challenged on behalf of the authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
43	45	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
43	46	The central question is whether section 117 authorises and requires the provision of the `` after-care services '' or whether it merely operates as a gateway section to trigger provisions under other statutory provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
43	47	If the first view prevails , it is common ground there is no right to charge for the after-care services because section 117 itself contains no charging provision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
43	48	On the other hand , if the second view is correct , the authorities may charge under other provisions even in cases covered by section 117 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
43	49	The three cases before the House concern the provision of caring residential accommodation to formerly detained mentally ill patients . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
43	50	But exactly the same issue could arise in respect of the other after-care services provided under section 117 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , eg psychiatric treatment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
43	51	In respect of residential accommodation the relevant other provision under which it is said that charging was authorised is section 21 of the National Assistance Act 1948 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
43	52	Section 21 contains an express charging provision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
43	53	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
43	54	For convenience of discussion I set out the material parts of section 117 as amended in 1995 and 1997 : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- This section applies to persons who are detained under section 3 above , or admitted to a hospital in pursuance of a hospital order made under section 37 above , or transferred to a hospital in pursuance of a hospital direction made under section 45A above or a transfer direction made under section 47 or 48 above , and then cease to be detained and -LRB- whether or not immediately after so ceasing -RRB- leave hospital . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
43	55	-LRB- 2 -RRB- It shall be the duty of the Health Authority and of the local social services authority to provide , in co-operation with relevant voluntary agencies , after-care services for any person to whom this section applies until such time as the Health Authority and the local social services authority are satisfied that the person concerned is no longer in need of such services ; but they shall not be so satisfied in the case of a patient who is subject to after-care under supervision at any time while he remains so subject . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
43	56	-LRB- 2A -RRB- it shall be the duty of the Health Authority to secure that at all times while a patient is subject to after-care under supervision - -LRB- a -RRB- a person who is a registered medical practitioner approved for the purposes of section 12 above by the Secretary of State as having special experience in the diagnosis or treatment of mental disorder is in charge of the medical treatment provided for the patient as part of the after-care services provided for him under this section ; and -LRB- b -RRB- '' -LRB- Emphasis added -RRB- It is important to note that section 117 applies to two primary classes of persons , viz mentally disabled persons detained for treatment under section 3 of the 1983 Act or by virtue of a hospital order made by the court pursuant to section 37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
43	57	In addition section 117 applies to smaller classes of persons detained under hospital directions made by the Crown Court under section 45A or transfer directions made by the Secretary of State under sections 47 and 48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
43	58	All classes of person to whom section 117 extends are exceptionally vulnerable persons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
43	59	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
43	60	Next it is necessary to identify what is embraced in the concept `` after-care services '' in section 117 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
43	61	There is no issue on this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
43	62	In Clunis v Camden and Islington Health Authority -LSB- 1998 -RSB- QB 978 , 992 Beldam LJ observed on behalf of the Court of Appeal : `` After-care services are not defined in the Act of 1983 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
43	63	They would normally include social work , support in helping the ex-patient with problems of employment , accommodation or family relationships , the provision of domiciliary services and the use of day centre and residential facilities . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
43	64	It is common ground that this was a correct description . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
43	65	It is agreed that caring residential accommodation is within the scope of section 117 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
43	66	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
43	67	It is now possible to address directly the issue before the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
43	68	If Parliament had intended by section 117 -LRB- 2 -RRB- to provide that after-care services would be provided under other statutory provisions , one would have expected section 117 -LRB- 2 -RRB- to specify the statutory provisions to be triggered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
43	69	Such a gateway provision would require appropriate wording . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
43	70	For a model of such a gateway provision one only needs to turn to section 2 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
43	71	Instead section 117 is free-standing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
43	72	It imposes a duty on the authorities to provide the after-care services and to continue to do so `` until such time as the person concerned is no longer in need of such services '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
43	73	That specific duty must be carried out in respect of each particular individual person to whom section 117 applies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
43	74	In my view section 117 -LRB- 2 -RRB- is incapable of being read as a duty to secure the provision of such services under unnamed other enactments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
43	75	Indeed sub-section -LRB- 2A -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- refers to `` after-care services provided under this section '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
43	76	Similarly , elsewhere in the 1983 Act there are repeated express references to `` after-care services provided under section 117 '' : see sections 25A to 25H . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
43	77	-LRB- Emphasis added -RRB- This use of language is inconsistent with the services being provided under other statutory provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
43	78	No parliamentary draftsman , charged with the task of producing a gateway provision , could conceivably have produced a text without any wording to indicate a gateway provision and with so many counter indications strewn over it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
43	79	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
43	80	Counsel for the authorities accepted in oral argument that there was a duty under section 117 to provide the after-care services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
43	81	Given the imperative language of section 117 -LRB- 2 -RRB- this concession could not be avoided . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
43	82	But counsel disputed that there was any power under section 117 to provide the after-care services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
43	83	He said the power must be found in other statutory provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
43	84	While attractively presented I have to say that this is a very contrived argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
43	85	The natural and obvious interpretation of section 117 -LRB- 2 -RRB- is that the duty by necessary implication imports a concomitant power to carry out the duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
43	86	If this view is correct , the result is that it is difficult to maintain a credible argument that the services were rendered under other provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
43	87	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
43	88	On appeal to the House counsel for the authorities also put forward a somewhat different argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
43	89	He argued that section 117 -LRB- 2 -RRB- simply contains the general duty on authorities to co-operate about discharged patients . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
43	90	In the face of the imperative language providing that the authorities `` shall provide after-care services '' until `` the person concerned is no longer in need of such services '' this contention is untenable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
43	91	In any event , section 22 of the National Health Service Act 1977 already provides , in appropriately worded language , for co-operation between health authorities and local authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
43	92	It was therefore unnecessary to enact section 117 -LRB- 2 -RRB- for the limited purpose of creating such a duty to co-operate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
43	93	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
43	94	Nevertheless , I am prepared to stand back and consider whether the interpretation of section 117 by the courts below lead to an anomalous result . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
43	95	As his trump card counsel for the appellant authorities referred the House to a comment by Jones , Mental Health Act Manualö 7th ed -LRB- 2001 -RRB- , on the consequence of the Court of Appeal decision in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
43	96	The author contrasted the following two hypothetical cases , at p 400 , para 1-967 : `` Case 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
43	97	A 50-year-old man with pre-senile dementia is admitted informally to hospital as a compliant mentally incompetent patient . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
43	98	He is assessed as requiring residential care on his discharge from hospital . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
43	99	He will almost certainly require such accommodation for the rest of his life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
43	100	He will be charged for the accommodation by virtue of section 22 of the National Assistance Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
43	101	Case 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
43	102	A 50 year-old man with pre-senile dementia and with identical needs to the man in Case 1 is admitted to hospital under section 3 of this Act because he happened not to be compliant when the crisis in his mental health occurred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
43	103	He is assessed as requiring residential care on his discharge from hospital . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
43	104	He will almost certainly require such accommodation for the rest of his life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
43	105	He will be provided with the accommodation without charge because he comes within the scope of section 117 . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
43	106	Counsel described this as the anomaly of the compliant and non-compliant patients in adjacent beds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
43	107	In my opinion this view is too simplistic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
43	108	There may well be a reasonable view that generally patients compulsorily admitted under sections 3 and 37 pose greater risks upon discharge to themselves and others than compliant patients . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
43	109	Moreover , Parliament necessarily legislates for the generality of cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
43	110	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
43	111	In the Court of Appeal Buxton LJ observed -LRB- at p 386B-C -RRB- that : `` the statutory provision is not at all anomalous , and not at all surprising . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
43	112	The persons referred to in section 117 -LRB- 1 -RRB- are an identifiable and exceptionally vulnerable class . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
43	113	To their inherent vulnerability they add the burden , and the responsibility for the medical and social service authorities , of having been compulsorily detained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
43	114	It is entirely proper that special provision should be made for them to receive after-care , and it would be surprising , rather than the reverse , if they were required to pay for what is essentially a health-related form of care and treatment . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
43	115	I agree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
43	116	I would only add a few comments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
43	117	The policy is that `` Compulsory admission powers should only be exercised in the last resort , '' eg only in very serious cases : para 2.7 of the Code of Practice issued by the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to section 118 of the 1983 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
43	118	A principal factor in making a decision to admit is `` the danger the patient presents to him or herself or others '' : para 2.7 of the Code of Practice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
43	119	In practice section 117 will in a large measure cover patients whose mental illness is such that they pose a risk to themselves or others . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
43	120	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
43	121	The consequences of acceding to the arguments of the authorities would be far reaching . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
43	122	Under section 72 of the 1983 Act a detained patient may apply to a mental health tribunal for discharge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
43	123	On discharge pursuant to a direction by a tribunal a patient may often still require medical and other care . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
43	124	Clearly , caring residential care -LRB- ensuring , for example , that prescribed medication is taken -RRB- may be essential . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
43	125	It takes the place of the hospital environment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
43	126	It can hardly be said that the mentally ill patient freely chooses such accommodation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
43	127	Charging them in these circumstances may be surprising . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
43	128	Moreover , under section 73 of the 1983 Act in respect of restricted patients -LRB- ie patients in respect of whom a restriction direction under section 41 of the 1983 Act has been made -RRB- , the tribunal is empowered to impose conditions of discharge upon the patient with which the patient is obliged to comply , eg in respect of residence and treatment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
43	129	The Home Secretary also has the power at any time thereafter to impose conditions upon the patient . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
43	130	Plainly in such cases the patients do not voluntarily avail themselves of the after care-services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord steyn
43	131	If the argument of the authorities is accepted that there is a power to charge these patients such a view of the law would not be testimony to our society attaching a high value to the need to care after the exceptionally vulnerable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord steyn
43	132	In my view the consequentialist arguments do not assist the case of the authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord steyn
43	133	They militate in favour of the interpretation upheld by Sullivan J and the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord steyn
43	134	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord steyn
43	135	There was an argument advanced on behalf of the appellant authorities based on taking into account Hansard material . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord steyn
43	136	It was a hopeless attempt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord steyn
43	137	The parliamentary material relied on throws no light whatever on the question of construction before the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord steyn
43	138	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord steyn
43	139	For these reasons , I would dismiss the appeal . 	lord steyn	self	outcome	0.9	lord steyn
