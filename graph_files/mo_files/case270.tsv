270	2	LORD BINGHAM OF CORNHILL 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
270	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
270	4	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
270	5	The issue in this appeal is whether the respondent Secretary of State acted unlawfully in declining to pay compensation to the appellant , Mr McFarland , who was imprisoned following a conviction which was later quashed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
270	6	In these proceedings , brought to challenge the Secretary of State 's decision to withhold payment of compensation , Mr McFarland has been denied relief by Kerr J -LRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- NIQB 14 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- NIJB 154 -RRB- and by the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland -LRB- Carswell LCJ , Campbell LJ and Weatherup J : -LSB- 2002 -RSB- NICA 28 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- NI 337 -RRB- .

270	7	He renews his challenge before the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
270	8	The facts 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
270	9	A nurse complained that Mr McFarland had entered her room in the nurses ' home at Tyrone County Hospital , Omagh , late at night and touched her indecently . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
270	10	Mr McFarland was questioned by the police and admitted that he had been in the nurse 's room and might have touched the nurse , but not that he had done so indecently . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
270	11	He was charged with indecent assault and pleaded guilty through solicitors at the Omagh Magistrates ' Court in December 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
270	12	In January 1999 application to vacate his plea of guilty was made to Mr McRandal , the resident magistrate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
270	13	He required medical evidence to support the application , but it was granted by another magistrate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
270	14	The case came on for hearing before Mr McRandal on 5 May 1999 , when application was made that the magistrate should disqualify himself because he knew of the original plea . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
270	15	The magistrate did not accede to this application , the hearing proceeded and the complainant gave evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
270	16	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	17	After this evidence the magistrate called prosecuting and defending counsel to see him privately in chambers , in the absence of Mr McFarland . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	18	As a result of this meeting , defending counsel spoke to Mr McFarland and , as put in McFarland 's affidavit sworn on 7 March 2000 , `` He lead -LSB- sic -RSB- me to understand that the Magistrate had taken a very strong and favourable view of the evidence of the two witnesses that he had heard . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	19	He advised me that if I continued to contest the matter his understanding was that the Magistrate would most certainly refer the matter to the High Court for sentencing where I would receive a sentence of 18 months or more '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	20	In the light of this intimation Mr McFarland changed his plea to guilty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	21	His counsel sought an adjournment so that a pre-sentence report could be obtained , but this was refused and Mr McFarland was sentenced to eight months ' imprisonment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	22	He appealed to the county court , but the county court judge questioned whether he could entertain an appeal following a plea of guilty ; the appeal was withdrawn and the conviction affirmed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	23	Mr McFarland served the appropriate part , four months , of the term imposed upon him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	24	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	25	Having served his sentence , Mr McFarland applied for judicial review to quash his conviction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	26	The application came before a Divisional Court -LRB- Carswell LCJ and Sir John Macdermott -RRB- on 20 June 2000 , and on 30 June the court gave judgment quashing the conviction : -LSB- 2000 -RSB- NI 403 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	27	There were before the court affidavits sworn by Mr McFarland , the magistrate and counsel who had represented Mr McFarland in the magistrates ' court , which to some extent conflicted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	28	But it was plain that there had been a private meeting in the magistrate 's chambers , that the magistrate had commented on the strength of the complainant 's evidence , that the magistrate had mentioned the possible need to refer the case to the Crown Court for sentence , where a sentence of eighteen months ' imprisonment might well be imposed , and that defence counsel had passed on the gist of the magistrate 's observations to Mr McFarland . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	29	Having analysed the affidavit evidence the Divisional Court rejected as `` unfounded '' the complaint made by Mr McFarland that he had been subjected to pressure by which his will had been overborne . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	30	The court however acceded to an alternative submission made on behalf of Mr McFarland , that he had been misled by the magistrate 's reference to sending the case to the Crown Court for sentence and to a sentence of eighteen months ' , since under the relevant legislation the magistrate could not commit Mr McFarland to the Crown Court for sentence after conviction , and therefore the maximum sentence which Mr McFarland could have faced on conviction by the magistrate was twelve months ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	31	The court treated the case as analogous with that considered in R v Turner -LSB- 1970 -RSB- 2 QB 321 , 326 , where Lord Parker CJ observed that `` once -LSB- the defendant -RSB- felt that this was an intimation emanating from the judge , it is really idle in the opinion of this court to think that he really had a free choice in the matter . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	32	Giving the judgment of the court Carswell LCJ concluded -LRB- page 409 -RRB- : `` The conviction in the present case is flawed , because it rests on a plea of guilty which was vitiated by the lack of true consent on the part of the applicant brought about by misapprehension stemming from the magistrate 's discussion with counsel . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	33	The court accordingly quashed the conviction and ruled that there could be no retrial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	34	The judgment ended with cautionary observations discouraging judges and magistrates from discussing with counsel in chambers matters relating either to issues in the case or to sentence : '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	35	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	36	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	37	we take the view that judges should exercise a considerable degree of reticence about giving an indication of the penalties which they have in mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	38	We certainly consider that they should be careful to avoid entering into discussions such as those in the present case which could be interpreted in such a way by the defendant as to affect his free will in deciding on his course of action . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	39	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	40	On 25 July 2000 , Mr McFarland 's solicitors applied to the Secretary of State for compensation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	41	The payment of compensation 6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	42	In any liberal democratic state there will be those who are accused of crime and are acquitted at trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	43	There will also be those who are convicted at trial but whose convictions are quashed on appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	44	All will suffer the stigma of being accused and the trauma of standing trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	45	Those convicted at trial are also likely to suffer some months of imprisonment before their appeals are heard . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	46	The question inevitably arises whether the state , which has initiated such unsuccessful , or ultimately unsuccessful , prosecutions should compensate those , or some of those , who are acquitted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
270	47	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	48	This is a difficult and sensitive question , for two main reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	49	The first is that ministers , being accountable for the expenditure of public money , are rightly circumspect about making gratuitous payments to members of the public ; and the need for circumspection is particularly great where the recipient may be a wholly innocent victim of mistake or misidentification or may be a serious criminal who is very fortunate to have escaped his just deserts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	50	While the public might approve sympathetic treatment of the former , they would be understandably critical if significant sums of public money were paid to the latter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	51	The second source of difficulty and sensitivity derives from the interaction , in this field , of judicial and executive activity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	52	Just as the courts must apply Acts of Parliament whether they approve of them or not , and give effect to lawful official decisions whether they agree with them or not , so Parliament and the executive must respect judicial decisions , whether they approve of them or not , unless or until they are set aside . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	53	This is reflected in section 14 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Criminal Appeal -LRB- Northern Ireland -RRB- Act 1980 and is currently reflected in section 10 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 , providing for suspect convictions to be referred to the Court of Appeal for a final decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	54	Only very rarely could it be appropriate for the executive to act in a way which threw doubt on a judicial decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	55	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	56	The payment of compensation to some acquitted defendants is by no means novel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	57	Adolf Beck was compensated in 1904 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	58	But the practice has in recent years been put on a more systematic footing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	59	On 29 July 1976 Mr Roy Jenkins , as Home Secretary , in a written answer -LRB- HC Deb , 29 July 1976 , cols 328-330 -RRB- , outlined the procedure to be followed when ex gratia payments were to be made to persons wrongly convicted or charged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	60	Claimants were to be informed : `` A decision to make an ex gratia payment from public funds does not imply any admission of legal liability ; it is not , indeed , based on considerations of liability for which there are appropriate remedies at civil law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	61	The payment is offered in recognition of the hardship caused by a wrongful conviction or charge and notwithstanding that the circumstances may give no grounds for a claim for civil damages . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	62	The Home Secretary made clear that the assessor would take into account any expenses incurred by the claimant `` in establishing his innocence or pursuing the claim for compensation . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	63	He continued : `` In considering the circumstances leading to the wrongful conviction or charge the assessor will also have regard , where appropriate , to the extent to which the situation might be attributable to any action , or failure to act , by the police or other public authority , or might have been contributed to by the accused person 's own conduct '' On 29 November 1985 , Mr Douglas Hurd , as Home Secretary , was asked to make a statement with regard to the payment of compensation to persons who had been wrongly convicted of criminal offences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	64	His written answer was -LRB- H.C. Deb. , 29 November 1985 . cols 691-692 -RRB- : `` There is no statutory provision for the payment of compensation from public funds to persons charged with offences who are acquitted at trial or whose convictions are quashed on appeal , or to those granted free pardons by the exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	65	Persons who have grounds for an action for unlawful arrest or malicious prosecution have a remedy in the civil courts against the person or authority responsible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	66	For many years , however , it has been the practice for the Home Secretary , in exceptional circumstances , to authorise on application ex gratia payments from public funds to persons who have been detained in custody as a result of a wrongful conviction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	67	In accordance with past practice , I have normally paid compensation on application to persons who have spent a period in custody and who receive a free pardon , or whose conviction is quashed by the Court of Appeal or the House of Lords following the reference of a case by me under section 17 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 , or whose conviction is quashed by the Court of Appeal or the House of Lords following an appeal after the time normally allowed for such an appeal has lapsed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	68	In future I shall be prepared to pay compensation to all such persons where this is required by our international obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	69	The international covenant on civil and political rights -LSB- article 14.6 -RSB- provides that : ` When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence and when subsequently his conviction has been reversed , or he has been pardoned , on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively that there has been a miscarriage of justice , the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such conviction shall be compensated according to law , unless it is proved that the non-disclosure of the unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	70	I remain prepared to pay compensation to people who do not fall within the terms of the preceding paragraph but who have spent a period in custody following a wrongful conviction or charge , where I am satisfied that it has resulted from serious default on the part of a member of a police force or of some other public authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	71	There may be exceptional circumstances that justify compensation in cases outside these categories . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	72	In particular , facts may emerge at trial , or on appeal within time , that completely exonerate the accused person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	73	I am prepared , in principle , to pay compensation to people who have spent a period in custody or have been imprisoned in cases such as this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	74	I will not , however , be prepared to pay compensation simply because at the trial or an appeal the prosecution was unable to sustain the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in relation to the specific charge that was brought . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	75	It has been the practice since 1957 for the amount of compensation to be fixed on the advice and recommendation of an independent assessor who , in considering claims , applies principles analogous to those on which claims for damages arising from civil wrongs are settled . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	76	The procedure followed was described by the then Home Secretary in a written reply to a question in the House of Commons on 29 July 1976 at columns 328-330 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
270	77	Although successive Home Secretaries have always accepted the assessor 's advice , they have not been bound to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	78	In future , however , I shall regard any recommendation as to amount made by the assessor in accordance with those principles as binding upon me . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	79	I have appointed Mr Michael Ogden QC as the assessor for England and Wales . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	80	He will also assess any case that arises in Northern Ireland , where my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland intends to follow similar practice . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	81	This statement was adopted without modification or addition by the Home Secretary -LRB- Mr Straw -RRB- and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 17 June 1997 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	82	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	83	Section 133 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 gave statutory effect to article 14 -LRB- 6 -RRB- of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , to which Mr Hurd referred in his statement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	84	For an applicant to qualify under that section it was , however , necessary that his conviction should have been `` reversed '' , and that expression was defined in subsection -LRB- 5 -RRB- in terms which do not include the quashing of Mr McFarland 's conviction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	85	His claim to compensation therefore falls to be considered only under the ex gratia scheme announced by Mr Hurd . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	86	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	87	Mr Larkin QC based his first challenge to the Secretary of State 's refusal of compensation on the terms of article 14 -LRB- 6 -RRB- of the ICCPR , which Mr Hurd had incorporated in his statement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	88	He contended that Mr McFarland had been convicted of a criminal offence ; that his conviction had in ordinary parlance been reversed , even if it had not been reversed within the narrow definition given to that expression in section 133 -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the 1988 Act ; that this reversal had been on the ground of a new or newly discovered fact ; that this new or newly discovered fact had shown that there had been a miscarriage of justice ; and that accordingly he was entitled to be compensated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	89	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	90	Skilfully and attractively presented though it was , this argument is subject to one fatal weakness : Mr McFarland 's conviction was not quashed on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact showed conclusively that there had been a miscarriage of justice , even if it be assumed in his favour -LRB- a highly debatable assumption , as the opinions of the House in R -LRB- Mullen -RRB- v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2004 -RSB- UKHL 18 make clear -RRB- that a miscarriage of justice was conclusively shown . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	91	In his written Case Mr McFarland contended : `` There is a ` newly discovered fact ' , in so far as the content of the conversation between the appellant 's counsel and the resident magistrate in chambers became known to the appellant only after he instituted his application to quash the conviction and his counsel and the magistrate swore their affidavits . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	92	But it is clear , as shown above , that the gist of the conversation between the magistrate and counsel was known to Mr McFarland at the time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	93	The conviction was quashed because the magistrate 's intimation was held to leave Mr McFarland with no effective choice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	94	Mr McFarland did not know at the time that the magistrate had misunderstood his committal power but this , even if a newly-discovered fact , was not the ground on which the conviction was quashed : the magistrate 's intimation would have been no less objectionable had he had the power which he believed himself to have . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	95	Both Kerr J -LRB- pp 162-163 -RRB- and the Court of Appeal -LRB- paragraph 9 -RRB- rejected this argument , and they were right to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	96	As was said by the Court of Appeal in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex p Bateman and Howse -LRB- 1994 -RRB- 7 Admin LR 175 , 182 , `` the ground of the reversal was not the discovery of a new or newly discovered fact , but a legal ruling on facts which had been known all along . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	97	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	98	There is in my opinion a further reason why Mr McFarland can not rely on the reference to article 14 -LRB- 6 -RRB- of the ICCPR which Mr Hurd included in his parliamentary statement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	99	This is that statutory effect has , since the date of Mr Hurd 's statement , been given to article 14 -LRB- 6 -RRB- by enactment of section 133 of the 1988 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	100	That contains provisions -LRB- such as the definition of `` reversal '' -RRB- which are not to be found in article 14 -LRB- 6 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	101	But Parliament can not have intended that those who failed to qualify under section 133 might nonetheless qualify under the corresponding passage of Mr Hurd 's statement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	102	It is plain that section 133 was intended to supersede that part of the statement , and Mr Straw 's unqualified adoption of the earlier statement does not in my opinion displace this inference . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	103	This objection was not raised by Mr McCloskey QC on behalf of the Secretary of State , but I think it clear that if Mr McFarland 's claim could not meet the condition in section 133 -LRB- as was admitted -RRB- it could not succeed in reliance on the corresponding passage in Mr Hurd 's statement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	104	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	105	Mr Larkin submitted , secondly , that Mr McFarland was entitled to be compensated because he had spent a period in custody following a wrongful conviction , and this resulted from serious default on the part of a member of a public authority other than the police force , namely the resident magistrate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	106	The first question is whether , within the meaning of Mr Hurd 's statement , the magistrate is to be regarded as a member of a public authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	107	In his letter on behalf of the Secretary of State , refusing payment , Mr Mercer bluntly asserted that the magistrate was not a public authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
270	108	In his affidavit sworn in these proceedings , he elaborated this assertion a little and deposed : `` I was advised that there is clear legal authority for the proposition that a Magistrate was not a public authority for the purpose of the statement . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	109	Mr Mercer had been correctly advised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	110	This was the opinion of the Divisional Court -LRB- Stuart-Smith LJ and Farquharson J -RRB- in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex p Harrison -LSB- 1988 -RSB- 3 All ER 86 , 89 , 92 ; of the Divisional Court -LRB- Leggatt LJ and McCullough J -RRB- in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex p Bateman and Howse -LRB- unreported , 5 May 1993 -RRB- , although in that judgment members of the Crown Prosecution Service were also , erroneously , excluded ; of the Divisional Court -LRB- Rose LJ and Richards J -RRB- in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex p Garner -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 11 Admin LR 595 , 607 ; of the Administrative Court -LRB- Thomas J -RRB- in R -LRB- Conlon -RRB- v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LRB- unreported , 11 December 2000 , paragraphs 27-32 -RRB- ; and , since the date of Mr Mercer 's decision , by the Administrative Court -LRB- Hooper J -RRB- in R -LRB- Al Daghir et al -RRB- v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LRB- unreported , 13 February 2004 , paragraphs 29-40 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	111	In the present case , Kerr J thought it `` obvious '' that the Home Secretary did not intend to include judges or resident magistrates within the category of members of some other public authority -LRB- page 162 -RRB- , and in the Court of Appeal the contrary was not argued orally -LRB- paragraph 12 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	112	But the argument was revived before the House , on which none of the authorities cited is binding , and the argument must be considered on its merits . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	113	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	114	In support of his argument that a resident magistrate should be regarded as a member of a public authority , Mr Larkin relied on Campbell v HM Advocate 1941 JC 86 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	115	That case concerned a bribe accepted by a member of a licensing court , and the question was whether such a court was a `` public body '' within the meaning of section 7 of the Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act 1889 , as extended by section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1916 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	116	Lord Fleming at first instance , and the Lord Justice-General -LRB- Normand -RRB- , Lord Moncrieff and Lord Carmont on appeal , were doubtful whether a licensing court fell within the definition of `` public body '' in the 1889 Act , but all were agreed that it fell within the extended definition in the 1916 Act which applied to `` local and public authorities of all descriptions '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	117	It was pointed out -LRB- page 88 -RRB- that the functions of the court were `` mainly of an administrative character '' and that it had `` complete discretionary power '' with regard to the number of licences to be granted and the persons to whom they should be granted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	118	I have no doubt that the decision in that case was correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	119	But the context in which the present question arises is wholly different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	120	Our task is to consider the meaning of a ministerial statement , not a statutory definition of a different expression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	121	I derive no help from this authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	122	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	123	It is of course possible to say that a judge or resident magistrate is a public servant , which is true , and to say that each is a member of the court to which he or she belongs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	124	And section 6 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Human Rights Act 1998 defines the expression `` public authority '' as including courts and tribunals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	125	But judges and magistrates would not in 1985 have been regarded as members of public authorities , and it is safe to infer that courts and tribunals were singled out in section 6 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the 1998 Act precisely because they would or might not , but for that provision , have been recognised to be public authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	126	It is in my opinion plain that when Mr Jenkins referred in 1976 to `` any action , or failure to act , by the police or other public authority '' he was not meaning to refer to judges and magistrates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	127	The same is true of Mr Hurd 's reference to `` serious default on the part of a member of a police force or of some other public authority '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	128	The contrary argument is , to my mind , wholly unpersuasive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	129	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	130	This conclusion makes it unnecessary to address the question whether there was here a `` serious default '' within the meaning of the same paragraph of Mr Hurd 's statement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	131	This is a question which , as he has candidly acknowledged , Mr Mercer did not consider . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	132	He was entitled to conclude that the question did not arise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	133	But I would make three observations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	134	First , had it been necessary to consider the question and make a judgment , the Secretary of State -LRB- or Mr Mercer on his behalf -RRB- had properly to be guided by the judgment of the court which quashed the conviction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	135	It would not generally be open to him to treat as minor what the court had treated as serious , or vice versa . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	136	He had to take his cue from the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	137	Secondly , had it been necessary to consider whether the resident magistrate 's default in this case was serious , the Secretary of State would probably have concluded , on reading the judgment , that it was not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	138	If the judgment contained criticism of the magistrate , it was of the mildest kind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
270	139	Thirdly , I am somewhat concerned that the course followed in this case did not attract the censure which , as I think , it merited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	140	The Code of Conduct for the Bar of Northern Ireland -LRB- 6 March 2003 -RRB- provides : `` 16.24 It is and always has been the practice in Northern Ireland that Counsel should have ready access to the Trial Judge but no discussion between Counsel and the Judge should take place unless the opposing Counsel is present or , having had reasonable notice , has declined to be present . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	141	16.26 In criminal matters Counsel for the Defence should only in very exceptional circumstances and with the permission of the Judge inform the client or give the client to understand that there has been a discussion of any aspect of the case with the Trial Judge and must never say or suggest to the client that which Counsel knows is in the Judge 's mind or purport to quote what the Judge has said in private . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	142	It is essential for Counsel at all times to maintain the confidentiality of the relationship between Counsel and the Judge . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	143	I would observe that the occasions when counsel may properly discuss a case with the trial judge otherwise than in open court , in the presence of the defendant , are rare . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	144	Occasions when he may properly withhold the fact or the gist of such a discussion from his client are rarer still -LRB- and counsel on this occasion , quite rightly , did not do so -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	145	I hope that these rules may be reconsidered and , if they are , the Bar may find it useful to take note of Practice Direction -LRB- Criminal Proceedings : Consolidation -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 WLR 2870 , para 45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	146	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	147	Mr Larkin 's third major submission was that the Secretary of State -LRB- through Mr Mercer -RRB- had misunderstood the decision of the Divisional Court quashing Mr McFarland 's conviction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	148	I can not accept this contention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	149	In his decision letter Mr Mercer did not attempt to summarise the effect of that decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	150	In his affidavit he noted the Lord Chief Justice 's view that Mr McFarland 's plea of guilty was vitiated by a lack of true consent brought about by misapprehension stemming from the magistrate 's discussion with counsel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	151	He also noted the Lord Chief Justice 's view that Mr McFarland 's will had not been overborne by pressure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	152	This was an accurate representation of what the judgment said , even if the distinction drawn by the court was a fine one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	153	It was not for the Secretary of State to go behind the judgment of the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	154	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	155	Mr Larkin did not submit that this case fell within the exceptional category of cases in which facts emerge at trial or on appeal within time which completely exonerate the accused person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	156	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	157	I would dismiss this appeal . 	lord bingham	self	outcome	0.5	lord bingham
270	158	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	159	LORD STEYN 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	160	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	161	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	162	I found the manner in which this appeal ought to be disposed of more troublesome than other members of the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	163	Since the reasoning adopted in dismissing the appeal gives rise to important questions of principle I must briefly record my concerns . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	164	I agree with Lord Bingham of Cornhill that Mr McFarland can not bring his case within article 14 -LRB- 6 -RRB- of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights -LRB- 1966 -RRB- or section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 . 	lord steyn	lord bingham	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	165	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	166	The remaining question is whether Mr McFarland was entitled to compensation under the policy statement announced by Mr Hurd on 29 November 1985 , which has already been cited in full by Lord Bingham . 	lord steyn	lord bingham	partagr	0.5	lord bingham
270	167	The two limbs on which Mr McFarland relies provide as follows : `` I remain prepared to pay compensation to people who do not fall within the terms of the preceding paragraph but who have spent a period in custody following a wrongful conviction or charge , where I am satisfied that it has resulted from serious default on the part of a member of a police force or of some other public authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	168	-LSB- The first limb -RSB- There may be exceptional circumstances that justify compensation in cases outside these categories . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
270	169	In particular , facts may emerge at trial , or on appeal within time , that completely exonerate the accused person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	170	I am prepared , in principle , to pay compensation to people who have spent a period in custody or have been imprisoned in cases such as this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	171	I will not , however , be prepared to pay compensation simply because at the trial or an appeal the prosecution was unable to sustain the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in relation to the specific charge that was brought . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	172	-LRB- The second limb -RSB- The question is whether Mr McFarland can bring himself within the scope of the relatively narrow first limb , or , very much as a fallback position , within the more onerous provisions of the more general second limb . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	173	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	174	I turn to the question how under the first limb one should approach the question whether the court is `` a public authority . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	175	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	176	Lord Bingham has observed that the Home Secretaries responsible for policy statements did not intend to include a court within the meaning of the concept of a `` public authority '' : para 15 . 	lord steyn	lord bingham	partagr	0.6	lord bingham
270	177	That I understand to be a reference to the personal views of the Home Secretaries . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	178	In my view , however , in respect of the many kinds of `` soft laws '' with which we are now familiar , one must bear in mind that citizens are led to believe that the carefully drafted and considered statements truly represent government policy which will be observed in decision-making unless there is good reason to depart from it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	179	It is an integral part of the working of a mature process of public administration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	180	Such policy statements are an important source of individual rights and corresponding duties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	181	In a fair and effective public law system such policy statements must be interpreted objectively in accordance with the language employed by the Minister . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	182	The citizen is entitled to rely on the language of the statement , seen as always in its proper context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	183	The very reason for making the statement is to give guidance to the public . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	184	The decision-maker , here a minister , may depart from the policy but until he has done so , the citizen is entitled to ask in a court of law whether he fairly comes within the language of the publicly announced policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	185	That question , like all questions of interpretation , is one of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	186	And on such a question of law it necessarily follows that the court does not defer to the Minister : the court is bound to decide such a question for itself , paying , of course , close attention to the reasons advanced for the competing interpretations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	187	This is not to say that policy statements must be construed like primary or subordinate legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	188	It seems sensible that a broader and wholly untechnical approach should prevail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	189	But what is involved is still an interpretative process conducted by a court which must necessarily be approached objectively and without speculation about what a particular Minister may have had in mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	190	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	191	That brings me to another aspect of the reasoning in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	192	Lord Bingham emphasises the fact that the statements of Mr Jenkins and Mr Hurd were made many years ago , i.e. in 1976 and in 1985 . 	lord steyn	lord bingham	partagr	0.6	lord bingham
270	193	This suggests that we must look at the point of construction through the lens of an earlier era . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	194	This proposition too creates a difficulty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	195	It is now settled that legislation , primary or secondary , must be accorded an always speaking construction unless the language and structure of statute reveals an intention to impress on the statute a historic meaning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	196	Exceptions to the general principle are a rarity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	197	If I am right in holding that the interpretation of a policy statement is a question of law , which must be approached objectively , it would be strange to regard ministerial statements as susceptible of only a historical interpretation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	198	One is surely entitled to expect greater rather than less flexibility in interpreting ministerial statements . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	199	In my view the correct approach is that stated by Cross , Statutory Interpretation , 3rd ed -LRB- 1995 -RRB- , at 51-52 , namely that the legislation -LRB- here read policy statement -RRB- `` should be interpreted in the light of its place within the system of legal norms currently in force '' -LRB- author 's emphasis -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
270	200	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	201	The phrase `` a public authority '' in the policy statement is not a term of art . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	202	It must be construed in a purposive way , taking particular account of the context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	203	What does that involve in the present case ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	204	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	205	One must surely in the first place concentrate on the role of a court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	206	In constitutional law as well as international law the courts are one of the three departments of state : Köbler v Republik Ostereich , judgment of ECJ , 2003 , para 32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	207	Institutionally a court is a public authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	208	The functions of a judge , magistrate or jury are of a public character . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	209	They exercise authority on behalf of the Monarch in deciding cases between the state and individuals , between individuals , and so forth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	210	Institutionally and functionally a judge , magistrate and jury are therefore the paradigm of a public authority : see the illuminating discussion in Joint Committee on Human Rights , The Meaning of Public Authority under the Human Rights Act , Seventh Report of Session 2003-2004 , HL paper 39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	211	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	212	In the modern world it is strange to say , in the context of the ex gratia scheme , that the police and the Crown Prosecution Service are public authorities but that a judge , magistrate and a jury are not public authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	213	How can such a curious and unjust interpretation be right ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	214	Imagine a situation where a magistrate was bribed or biased in the sense of having a personal motive to find against a party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	215	According to the holding of the majority such a case falls outside the scope of the words `` a public authority '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	216	It is true , as Lord Bingham has mentioned , that this view has been upheld in a series of decisions , starting with an unmotivated obiter dictum in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department , ex p Harrison -LSB- 1988 -RSB- 3 All ER 86 , at 89 and 92 . 	lord steyn	lord bingham	partagr	0.7	lord bingham
270	217	The distinctive feature of the subsequent decisions is emphasis rather than analysis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	218	The decisions are conclusionary in nature , derivative from one another , and do not address the questions which arise let alone provide answers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	219	The decisions are not binding on the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	220	Moreover , one is entitled to ask what citizens will make of the idea that victims of wrongful convictions may be compensated for a serious default of the police and prosecution , but in respect of very serious misconduct by a judge , magistrate or jury the policy statement excludes them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	221	Surely , this creates the risk of an impression in the public mind of judges protecting their own kind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	222	There must be something awry in the legal logic which leads to such a result . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	223	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	224	In my opinion the sensible and practical construction is to hold that a judge , magistrate and jury are within the meaning of `` a public authority '' in the policy statement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	225	On the other hand , it would be acceptable to filter out minor errors by making clear that a very high threshold must be passed for something to constitute `` serious default '' on the part of a judge , magistrate or jury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	226	Perhaps it must be something in the nature of misconduct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	227	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	228	Given that a contrary view has prevailed on the point under consideration , it may be that the extant policy statement will now require explicit revision to cover serious default of a judge , magistrate or jury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	229	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	230	That brings me to the question whether there was `` serious default '' on the part of the magistrate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
270	231	Lord Bingham has summarised the factual position as follows : `` There were before the court affidavits sworn by Mr McFarland , the magistrate and counsel who had represented Mr McFarland in the magistrates ' court , which to some extent conflicted . 	lord steyn	lord bingham	partagr	0.8	lord bingham
270	232	But it was plain that there had been a private meeting in the magistrate 's chambers , that the magistrate had commented on the strength of the complainant 's evidence , that the magistrate had mentioned the possible need to refer the case to the Crown Court for sentence , where a sentence of eighteen months ' imprisonment might well be imposed , and that defence counsel had passed on the gist of the magistrate 's observations to Mr McFarland . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	233	For my part this was outrageous conduct on the part of the magistrate reminiscent of judicial habits of a bygone era . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	234	It deserved severe censure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	235	However , as Lord Bingham has observed , if the judgment contained criticism of the magistrate , it was of the mildest kind : -LSB- 2000 -RSB- NI 403 . 	lord steyn	lord bingham	partagr	0.8	lord bingham
270	236	I am troubled by the position that has arisen . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	237	Allegiance to the discipline of the law requires one to follow the indisputable evidence where it leads . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	238	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	239	Given the terms of the judgment , on which the Secretary of State was entitled to base his decision about an award of compensation , I would nevertheless with considerable hesitation not press to a dissent my view that there was `` a serious default '' by the magistrate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	240	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	241	I would accept that the decision of the Secretary of State that Mr McFarland does not qualify for compensation under the second limb was open to him in the circumstances of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	242	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	243	I would also dismiss the appeal . 	lord steyn	self	outcome	0.8	lord bingham
270	244	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	245	LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	246	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	247	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	248	Persons who have been imprisoned following a conviction which later has been quashed have two possible routes for seeking compensation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	249	One route is to claim compensation under section 133 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	250	The other is to apply for an ex gratia payment from the Home Secretary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	251	The difference is obvious . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	252	If the case can be brought within section 133 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , the claimant has a statutory right to compensation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	253	If it can not be brought within the section , the claimant has no right to compensation but merely the hope , and sometimes the expectation , that he will be the recipient of an ex gratia payment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	254	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	255	The facts of the present case have been set out by my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill . 	lord scott	lord bingham	partagr	0.8	lord bingham
270	256	As my noble and learned friend has explained in paragraph 9 of his opinion , Mr McFarland can not bring his case within section 133 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	lord scott	lord bingham	partagr	0.8	lord bingham
270	257	If he is to receive compensation it must be an ex gratia payment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	258	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	259	In a statement to the House of Commons made on 29 November 1985 the then Home Secretary , Mr Douglas Hurd , explained the circumstances in which he would be prepared in the future to make ex gratia payments of compensation to persons who had spent time in custody before their convictions had been quashed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	260	This statement has been overtaken in part by the enactment of section 133 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1988 Act but , apart from that , has not been modified or added to and has been the basis on which successive subsequent Home Secretaries have made , or refused to make , ex gratia payments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
270	261	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	262	Mr McFarland applied to the Secretary of State for compensation but his request was refused . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	263	He brought an application for judicial review challenging the refusal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	264	The relief sought included a declaration that `` the Applicant is entitled to have a decision by the Secretary of State in accordance with the law on his request for compensation arising out of his imprisonment on a wrongful conviction . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	265	and an order that `` the matter be remitted to the Secretary of State to be considered in accordance with the ruling of this Court . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	266	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	267	In the courts below and in this House the Home Secretary 's statement of 29 November 1985 has been subjected to a process of construction and analysis with a view to ascertaining whether the facts of Mr McFarland 's case bring him within one or other of the categories of case in which , according to the statement , the Home Secretary would be prepared to make an ex gratia payment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	268	Having read the opinion of Lord Bingham I am in full agreement with the reasons he has given for concluding that Mr McFarland 's case falls within none of those categories . 	lord scott	lord bingham	ackn	0.9	lord bingham
270	269	I agree , in particular , that section 133 -LRB- 1 -RRB- has subsumed the category of cases that would previously have fallen within Article 14 -LRB- 6 -RRB- of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . 	lord scott	lord bingham	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	270	I agree also that a magistrate would not normally be regarded as `` a member of a police force or of some other public authority '' . 	lord scott	lord bingham	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	271	But this process of construction and analysis of the Home Secretary 's statement that your Lordships , and the courts below , have engaged in seems to me sufficiently odd to warrant a few supplementary remarks . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	272	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	273	In making ex gratia payments the Home Secretary is disbursing public money . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	274	But he is not doing so pursuant to any statutory duty or statutory power . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	275	There is no statute to be construed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	276	He is exercising a Crown prerogative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	277	He is accountable for what he does with public money to Parliament and , in particular , to the House of Commons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	278	The making of ex gratia payments is lawful if , but not unless , there is Parliamentary authority for the disbursements -LRB- see Auckland Harbour Board v The King -LSB- 1924 -RSB- AC 318 per Viscount Haldane at pp 326/7 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	279	Your Lordships have , not surprisingly , not been addressed on this aspect of the ex gratia scheme but presumably the ex gratia payments in wrongful conviction cases are authorised by some provision in the annual Appropriation Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham

270	281	So , on the footing that the requisite Parliamentary authority exists , the ex gratia payments are lawfully made under the prerogative power of the Crown . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	282	It is now well established that the Crown prerogative origin of the power to make ex gratia payments does not exclude the scheme under which the payments are made from judicial review -LRB- see R v CICB Ex parte Lain -LSB- 1967 -RSB- 2 QB 864 and R v CICB Ex parte P -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 1 WLR 845 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	283	But the scope of the courts ' powers of intervention are , in my opinion , limited by the nature of the prerogative power in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	284	The Secretary of State for the time being is not bound by the statement of policy made by his predecessor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	285	He is not bound to make an ex gratia payment to a person whose case falls within the current statement of policy and he is not bound to refuse a payment to a person whose case falls outside it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	286	Provided the Secretary of State avoids irrationality in his decisions about who is and who is not to receive ex gratia payments , and provided the procedure he adopts for the decision making process is not unfair , I find it difficult to visualise circumstances in which his decision could be held on judicial review to be an unlawful one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	287	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	288	In the present case Mr McFarland 's complaints about the refusal of his compensation claim seem to me to be a distance away from what would be necessary to impugn the refusal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	289	If the Secretary of State is not willing , post the enactment of section 133 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , to consider making payments pursuant to Article 14 -LRB- 6 -RRB- of the ICCPR , there is nothing irrational about that . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	290	If the Secretary of State is not prepared to make ex gratia payments to compensate those who have suffered imprisonment on account of some serious error by a judge or magistrate , there is nothing irrational in that . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	291	Nor would there be anything irrational in a policy that did allow ex gratia payments in such cases , a policy that many , or most , might prefer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
270	292	The policy , bar irrationality , is for the Secretary of State . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham
