292	1	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	2	LORD BINGHAM OF CORNHILL 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	4	I am in full agreement with the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough , which I have had the opportunity to read in draft . 	lord bingham	lord hobhouse	fullagr	0	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	4	I am in full agreement with the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough , which I have had the opportunity to read in draft . 	lord bingham	lord hobhouse	ackn	0	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	5	I gratefully adopt his summary of the facts , the history of these proceedings and the submissions of the parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	6	A time charterparty such as the present represents a complex commercial bargain between owner and charterer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	7	The owner undertakes for the period of the charter to make his vessel available to serve the commercial purposes of the charterer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	8	To this end the hull , machinery and equipment of the vessel are to be in a thoroughly efficient state , the capacity and fuel consumption of the vessel are specified and the vessel is to be ready to receive the charterer 's intended cargo . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	9	The owner undertakes these obligations in consideration of the charterer 's undertaking to pay for the hire of the vessel at an agreed rate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	10	The charterer agrees to pay hire for the vessel because he wants to make use of it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	11	Crucial to the bargain , for him , are the terms which require the master to prosecute his voyages with the utmost despatch , which provide that the master -LRB- although appointed by the owner -RRB- shall be under the orders and directions of the charterer as regards employment and which require the charterer to furnish the master from time to time with all requisite instructions and sailing directions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	12	The complexity of a time charterparty derives partly from the fact that ownership and possession of the vessel , which remain in the owner , are separated from use of the vessel , which is granted to the charterer , and partly from the peculiar characteristics and hazards of carriage by sea . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	13	As one would expect , the safety and security of the vessel , her crew and her cargo are treated as matters of the highest importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	14	The charterers may only -LRB- under the present charter -RRB- send the vessel to safe berths , safe ports and safe anchorages , always afloat and always within Institute Warranty Limits , and the parties in this case agreed a long list of further exclusions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	15	The owners are to remain responsible for the navigation of the vessel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	16	The scope of this last , very important , stipulation is the main issue argued in this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	17	The starting point in the present case is , in my opinion , the master 's obligation to prosecute his voyages with the utmost despatch . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	18	Irrespective of any express orders by the charterer , that would ordinarily require him to take the route which is shortest and therefore quickest , unless there is some other route which is usual or there is some other maritime reason for not taking the shortest and quickest route . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	19	Helpful guidance on the correct approach in law was given by Lord Porter in Reardon Smith Line Limited v. Black Sea and Baltic General Insurance Company Limited -LSB- 1939 -RSB- A.C. 562 at 584 , a case concerned with deviation under a voyage charterparty : `` The law upon the matter is , I think , reasonably plain , though its application may from time to time give rise to difficulties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	20	It is the duty of a ship , at any rate when sailing upon an ocean voyage from one port to another , to take the usual route between those two ports . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	21	If no evidence be given , that route is presumed to be the direct geographical route , but it may be modified in many cases for navigational or other reasons , and evidence may always be given to show what the usual route is , unless a specific route be prescribed by the charter party or bill of lading . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	22	The majority arbitrators referred to evidence before them that in the period 1 March to 31 May 1994 Ocean Routes had provided advice to some 360 vessels routed from the Pacific north west of North America to northern China , Korea or Japan , all of which had sailed on a northern route save for vessels heading for destinations far to the south of Japan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	23	From that it would seem that the great circle route , which was the shortest and quickest route , was the usual route , although the arbitrators made no express finding to that effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	24	There was -LRB- so far as we know -RRB- no evidence to suggest that the rhumb line route was the usual , or a usual , route , and no finding to that effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	25	So , in the absence of what Lord Porter called `` navigational or other reasons '' for not taking the shortest and quickest route , the master was contractually obliged to take it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	26	The majority arbitrators concluded that the master had no good reason for not taking the shortest and quickest route . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	27	The dissenting arbitrator concluded that because the master was influenced by his previous bad experience of the great circle route and by his concern for safety he was `` absolutely entitled '' to decide as he did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	28	The majority , however , in paragraph 21 of their reasons , `` considered that the Disponent Owners were prima facie in breach of their obligation under Clause 8 to ensure that the Master prosecuted his voyages with the utmost despatch . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	29	In paragraph 24 of their reasons the majority arbitrators again referred to `` the Master 's breach in failing to prosecute the voyage with due despatch . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	30	With those conclusions , on the findings of the majority arbitrators , I agree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	31	In the absence of evidence that the rhumb line route was the usual route or a usual route , and in the absence of any satisfactory navigational or other reason for taking a longer and slower route , the master 's obligation of utmost despatch required him to take the shortest and quickest route . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	32	This conclusion is in my view inescapable irrespective of any express orders given by the charterers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	33	But the decisions at all three levels below , and the argument at all levels including the House , primarily concentrated not on the master 's duty of despatch but on the legitimacy of the charterers ' express instructions to the master , following advice from Ocean Routes , to take the great circle route . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	34	Relying on clauses 11 and 8 , the charterers contended that these were instructions concerning the employment of the vessel which they were entitled to give and with which the master was bound to comply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	35	The owners relied on their responsibility , under clause 26 , for the navigation of the vessel and on their exemption , under clause 16 , from liability for errors of navigation , as grounds for resisting the charterers ' contention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	36	The majority arbitrators concluded that the master had no good reasons for rejecting the charterers ' instructions to take the great circle route . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	37	Impliedly , therefore , they accepted that the charterers were entitled to give such instructions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	38	They did not find that the navigation exception availed the master , since he `` had decided at the outset not to follow the course recommended by the weather routing service . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	39	The dissenting arbitrator did not find that the charterers ' instructions did not relate to the employment of the vessel but held that the master was entitled not to comply because he `` has to have the ultimate decision and responsibility for navigation . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	40	Oral argument before the judge no doubt led to a refinement of the issues , and his conclusion -LRB- -LSB- 1999 -RSB- QB 72 at 82 -RRB- was clear and unequivocal : `` In my judgment these considerations lead to the conclusion that a decision whether to proceed across the Pacific by taking the great circle route or the rhumb line route or course would also be a decision in and about the navigation of the vessel and not in and about her employment . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	41	The merits of that decision did not matter because `` it was not , in my judgment , a decision as to the employment but as to the navigation of the vessel '' -LRB- p. 82 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	42	In the Court of Appeal , Potter LJ was more guarded than the judge , but held that since the master 's reasons for taking the rhumb line route were based on the safety of the vessel and were not shown to be other than bona fide -LRB- despite his lack of candour concerning his reasons for taking the rhumb line route on the second disputed voyage -RRB- it was a decision as to navigation : -LSB- 2000 -RSB- QB 241 at 261 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	43	The judge 's decision was trenchantly criticised by the late Mr. Brian Davenport Q.C. in an article -LRB- `` Rhumb Line or Great Circle ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	44	- That is a Question of Navigation '' -LSB- 1998 -RSB- LMCLQ 502 -RRB- which brings home the loss which English commercial law has suffered by his death and the cruelty of an affliction which denied him the judicial eminence he would surely have achieved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	45	Both the judge 's decision and that of the Court of Appeal were criticised as `` regrettable '' by Mr. Donald Davies , now the doyen of London maritime arbitrators : -LSB- 1999 -RSB- LMCLQ 461 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	46	In Reefer Express Lines Pty Ltd v. Cool Carriers AB -LRB- 24 January 1996 -RRB- New York arbitrators considered a charterparty containing clauses similar to clauses 8 and 11 of the present charter , it being accepted that the master was the final authority with respect of matters of navigation and safety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	47	On facts indistinguishable from the present , save that the master had somewhat better reasons for refusing to comply with the charterers ' instructions to take the great circle route from Seattle to northern China , the arbitrators unanimously held that the master had breached his duty under the charterparty by not following the charterers ' directions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	48	Clause 8 of the present charterparty , providing that the master -LRB- although appointed by the owners -RRB- shall be under the orders and directions of the charterers , gives the charterer his key right under the contract : to decide where the vessel shall go and what she shall carry , how -LRB- in short -RRB- she shall be used , always subject to the terms of the charterparty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	49	The language used is general , and the power correspondingly wide . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	50	Caution is called for in reading earlier authorities in which the meaning of `` navigation '' has been considered , since the expression has been construed in different contracts and different factual contexts , but the cases nonetheless give valuable guidance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	51	In Good v . The London Steam-Ship Owners ' Mutual Protecting Association -LRB- 1871 -RRB- LR 6 CP 563 a sea-cock and a bilge-cock were left open , permitting the entry of water which damaged cargo . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	52	A claim was made against the owners of the vessel by consignees of the cargo , and the question was whether the damage had been caused by improper navigation , against which the owners were entitled to be indemnified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	53	Willes J -LRB- at page 569 -RRB- said : `` Improper navigation within the meaning of this deed is something improperly done with the ship or part of the ship in the course of the voyage . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	54	In Carmichael & Co. v . The Liverpool Sailing Ship Owners ' Mutual Indemnity Association -LRB- 1887 -RRB- 19 QBD 242 damage was caused to cargo because water entered the vessel through a port in the side of the vessel which had not been securely closed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	55	It was held to have been caused by `` improper navigation of the ship . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	56	A different conclusion was reached in Canada Shipping Co. v. British Shipowners ' Mutual Protection Association -LRB- 1889 -RRB- 23 QBD 342 where cargo was contaminated through failure to clean the hold after a previous cargo . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	57	Bowen LJ -LRB- at page 344 -RRB- said : `` Navigation must mean something having to do with the sailing of the ship ; that is , of course , the sailing of the ship having regard to the fact that she is a cargo-carrying ship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	58	Here the damage was caused by something which had nothing to do with the sailing of the ship . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	59	The Renée Hyaffil -LRB- 1915 -RRB- 32 TLR 83 ; -LRB- 1916 -RRB- 32 TLR 660 concerned a vessel bound for London from Gandia with a cargo of fruit and vegetables . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	60	The master put into Corunna where he remained for 23 days , for several reasons , including his reluctance to face the Bay of Biscay in winter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	61	It was held that damage to the cargo had not been caused by a neglect , default or error of judgment in the navigation or management of the vessel within the meaning of the exceptions in the bills of lading . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	62	In S.S. Lord -LRB- Owners -RRB- v. Newsum Sons and Company Limited -LSB- 1920 -RSB- 1 KB 846 the dispute was between owner and charterer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	63	The master had decided to remain in port for some time , despite advice to continue the voyage by a prescribed route . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	64	Bailhache J. held that the master 's deliberate choice , while in harbour , of one of two routes to be pursued could not be an error in the management or navigation of the ship within the meaning of an exception in the charterparty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	65	While the judge , in my opinion , erred in his formulation of principle , I would not question his conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	66	The decision is inconsistent with the view that the choice of route from one port to another is a navigational matter within the sole discretion of the master . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	67	The time-charterers in Suzuki and Co. Limited v. J. Beynon and Co. Limited -LRB- 1926 -RRB- 42 TLR 269 complained that the master had not prosecuted a voyage with the despatch required by clause 9 of the charterparty , apparently through insufficient consumption of coal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	68	The issue was whether the master 's failure fell within clause 14 exempting the owner from liability for negligence or default of the master in the management or navigation of the steamer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	69	There was a difference of opinion in the Court of Appeal and in the House of Lords . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	70	At page 274 Lord Sumner said : `` I see no ground for bringing the captain 's action or inaction under the head of navigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	71	I speak with humility after what has just been said , but I still think that there is a real field in which the captain 's shortcomings would not fall within the exception clause 14 , and yet would constitute a breach of his obligation to use dispatch under clause 9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	72	The maintenance of full speed may often be part of the duty which those responsible for navigation have to perform , directly or by others , as , for example , in order to save a tide at a bar or to correct excessive leeway or deflection by currents , or to make the ship quick to answer her helm , or to make a course good against head winds , or what not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	73	Here , however , it is not pretended that the ship was handled in an unseamanlike manner , or that either ship or cargo was imperilled by the navigation that took place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	74	The term `` management '' may better fit the present case , but it is not a term of art ; it has no precise legal meaning , and its application depends on the facts , as appreciated by persons experienced in dealing with steamers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	75	There is a management which is of the shore , and a management which is of the sea . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	76	I do not think the award states the facts sufficiently to enable us to say that the evidence is all one way to show mismanagement of the steamer , in the sense of clause 14 , and without more facts before us we could not in any case deal with the question as a practical matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	77	Clause 9 is emphatically a merchants ' clause . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	78	Its object is to give effect to the mercantile policy of preferring a saving of time to a saving of coal . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	79	The facts of Larrinaga Steamship Company v . The King -LSB- 1945 -RSB- AC 246 were unusual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	80	The vessel , discharging at St. Nazaire , was ordered by charterers to return to Cardiff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	81	Despite severely deteriorating weather conditions a Sea Transport Officer instructed the vessel to sail on completion of discharge to Quiberon Bay to join a convoy bound for the Bristol Channel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	82	The master protested but complied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	83	The vessel grounded and suffered damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	84	The owners claimed against the Crown as charterers , contending that the damage had resulted from the charterers ' order to return to Cardiff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	85	Lord Wright -LRB- as page 256 -RRB- said : `` The view of the judge was that what he described as the ` sailing orders to Quiberon Bay to be obeyed forthwith ' were orders as to employment within cl . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	86	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	87	With the greatest respect , I can not agree with that view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	88	These sailing orders which the judge found were given were , in my opinion , merely dealing with matters of navigation , in regard to carrying out the orders to proceed to Cardiff '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	89	Lord Porter -LRB- at page 261 -RRB- said : `` Three answers to this argument have been made by the respondent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	90	-LRB- 1 -RRB- That though an order specifying the voyage to be performed is an order as to employment , yet an order as to the time of sailing is not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	91	That order , it is contended , is one as to navigation , or , at any rate , not as to employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	92	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	93	this distinction seems to me to be justified : an order to sail from port A to port B is in common parlance an order as to employment , but an order that a ship shall sail at a particular time is not an order as to employment because its object is not to direct how the ship shall be employed , but how she shall act in the course of that employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	94	If the word were held to include every order which affected not the employment itself but any incident arising in the course of it almost every other liability undertaken by the charterer would be otiose , since the owners would be indemnified against almost all losses which the ship would incur in prosecuting her voyages . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	95	Then -LRB- at page 262 -RRB- Lord Porter continued : '' -LRB- 2 -RRB- The second answer of the respondents was that even if it were conceded that orders to sail in a storm were orders in respect of which an indemnity is due , they must still be orders of the charterers as charterers and such as under this charterparty they are entitled to give . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	96	The mere instruction to sail may be such an order , but such an instruction leaves it to the discretion of the master who is responsible for the safety of his ship to choose the time and opportunity for starting on his voyage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	97	I know of no right on the part of a charterer to insist that the safety of the ship should be endangered by sailing at a time when seamanship requires her to stay in port . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	98	Lastly , I would refer to Newa Line v. Erechthion Shipping Co. . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	99	SA -LSB- 1987 -RSB- 2 Lloyd 's Rep. 180 , in which Staughton J. at page 185 said : '' -LRB- 2 -RRB- Orders as to employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	100	It is well settled that the orders which a charterer is entitled to give , and an owner bound to obey , are orders as to the employment of the vessel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	101	They do not include orders as to navigation , which remains in the control of the owner through his master - at any rate in the absence of special and unusual terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	102	It follows that a charterer , again in the absence of such terms , is only bound to indemnify the owner against the consequences of orders as to employment , and not of orders as to navigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	103	That is established by Weir v . The Union Steamship Company Ltd. , -LSB- 1900 -RSB- A.C. 525 , Larrinaga Steamship Co. Ltd. v . The King , -LRB- 1945 -RRB- 78 Ll.L.Rep . 167 ; -LSB- 1945 -RSB- A.C. 246 , the Stag Line case , Scrutton on Charterparties -LRB- 19th ed . -RRB- p. 376 , Carver on Carriage by Sea -LRB- 13th ed . -RRB- par . 669 , Wilford on Time Charters -LRB- 2nd ed . -RRB- pp. 197-198 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	104	`` The question here is whether the order to proceed to Dawes Island anchorage was an order as to employment or as to navigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	105	Seeing that the manifest intention was for the vessel to lighten there by discharging part of her cargo , I am of opinion that it was plainly an order as to employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	106	By contrast the advice of the pilot as to precisely where the vessel should anchor , if it had been an order and if -LRB- which is not suggested -RRB- it had been given on behalf of the charterers , would have been an order as to navigation . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	107	It is not hard to think of orders which plainly relate to the employment of the vessel and others which plainly relate to its navigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	108	It is much less easy to formulate any test which clearly distinguishes between the two . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	109	The charterer 's right to use the vessel must be given full and fair effect ; but it can not encroach on matters falling within the specialised professional maritime expertise of the master , particularly where the safety or security of the vessel , her crew and her cargo are involved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	110	He is the person , on the vessel , immediately responsible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	111	Technical questions concerning the operation of the vessel are for him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	112	Thus a decision when , in the prevailing conditions of wind , tide and weather , to sail from a given port is plainly a navigational matter , as held in the Larrinaga case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	113	By contrast , a decision without good reason to remain in port instead of continuing with a voyage -LRB- as in The Renée Hyaffil and The S.S. Lord -RRB- or to economise on bunkers for no good maritime reason -LRB- as in the Suzuki case -RRB- were properly regarded as falling outside the navigational area reserved to the master 's professional judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	114	Despite the judgments below , I am of the clear opinion that the majority arbitrators were right to hold that the orders to take the great circle route on both the disputed voyages were orders which the charterers were entitled to give and with which -LRB- on the arbitrators ' findings -RRB- the owners were bound to comply .

292	116	As pointed out in Lenfestey 's Dictionary of Nautical Terms at page 196 , `` To sail a perfect circle route would require continuous course changes , because a great circle intersects each meridian at a different angle -LRB- except when sailing straight along the equator -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	117	Since this is not practical , a series of points are established along the course , and the rhumb lines between them are sailed . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	118	The responsibility for making good , so far as practicable , whatever course is chosen of course remains with the master and crew , as does that for navigating the vessel safely into and out of port , and responding to maritime problems encountered in the open sea . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hobhouse

292	138	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	139	This is an appeal under the Arbitration Act 1979 from a reasoned award of arbitrators appointed under a time charter dated Tokyo 21 October 1993 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	140	It was one of a chain of charterparties relating to the Liberian motor ship Hill Harmony described as being of 15,622 tons gross and 9,017 tons net register , having a deadweight capacity of 24,683 metric tons and a laden service speed of about 13 knots in good weather conditions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	141	She had been built in 1985 and was a bulk carrier with 5 holds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	142	The parties to the relevant charterparty were the respondents Whistler International Ltd of the British Virgin Islands as disponent owners and the appellants Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd of Tokyo as charterers : I will call them respectively the ` owners ' and the ` charterers ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	143	The time charter which was for 7/9 months at charterers ' option was on the New York Produce Exchange form with amendments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	144	It contained a London arbitration clause -LRB- clause 17 -RRB- referring disputes to the arbitration of three commercial and shipping men in London in accordance with English law , the decision of any two of them to be final . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	145	The disputes between the owners and charterers was referred to arbitration in accordance with this clause . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	146	The arbitrators by a majority decided substantially in favour of the charterers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	147	The owners obtained leave to take the award to the Commercial Court under the Act and Clarke J reversed the decision of the arbitrators , -LSB- 1999 -RSB- QB 72 , but certified that the award raised a question of law of general public importance and gave leave to appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	148	The charterers ' appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed , -LSB- 2000 -RSB- QB 241 , and they have now appealed with leave to your Lordships ' House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	149	The relevant dispute relates to two laden voyages performed by the vessel from Vancouver to Japan in respectively January/February and April/May 1994 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	150	The actual cargoes carried are immaterial and were presumably non-perishable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	151	The respective voyages should only have taken about 16 3/4 and 13 3/4 days . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	152	But on neither voyage did the vessel go by the shortest route . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	153	As a result , on one voyage she took 6 1/2 days longer to get to her destination and consumed some 130 tons more fuel and on the other she took 3 ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	154	days longer and consumed some 69 tons more . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	155	The loss to the charterers was about US$ 89,800 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	156	The owners denied liability for the charterers ' loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	157	They contended that they were not obliged to send the vessel on the shortest route and furthermore were entitled to reject orders from the charterers to take the shortest route . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	158	So far as presently relevant , the charterparty provided as follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	159	The vessel was let to the charterers for worldwide trading via safe ports , berths or anchorages always within Institute Warranty Limits . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	160	These limits are the geographical limits contained in the standard terms of marine H&M policies so this provision has the effect of precluding the charterers from requiring the vessel to go outside the geographical limits permitted by the owners ' insurance cover assuming that that cover is on the ordinary terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	161	-LRB- The charterparty also excluded a list of other areas or countries which are not material to the present dispute , mostly relating to political and cognate risks . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	162	Similarly there were clauses relating to ice which are likewise not relevant . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	163	The owners undertook that the vessel when delivered would be seaworthy and in every way fit for the charter service and she was to be so maintained during the service . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	164	-LRB- cl .1 -RRB- -LRB- A similar obligation of due diligence arose under the clauses paramount incorporated in the charterparty . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	165	The owners had also to provide and pay for the crew . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	166	Nothing in the charterparty was to construed as a demise of the vessel to the charterers and the owners were to remain responsible for the navigation of the vessel , acts of pilots and/or tugboats , insurance , crew and all other matters as when trading for their own account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	167	-LRB- cl .26 -RRB- The charterers were to provide and pay for the bunkers whilst the vessel was on hire and to pay for port charges , pilotages , agencies and all other usual charges . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	168	-LRB- cl .2 -RRB- The charterers were to pay the hire half-monthly in advance at the agreed rate , the liability accruing from day to day except when the vessel was off-hire . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	169	-LRB- cl .4 -RRB- The charterparty contained an off-hire clause -LRB- cl .15 -RRB- which is not material to the present appeal since the arbitrators rejected the charterers ' claim under that clause on a point of construction and that part of their decision was not the subject of an appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	170	I express no view upon it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	171	The charterers were also under an obligation to furnish the captain of the vessel from time to time with all requisite instructions and sailing directions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	172	-LRB- cl .11 -RRB- The captain was to prosecute his voyages with the utmost dispatch and was , although appointed by the owners , to be under the orders and directions of the charterers as regards employment and agency . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	173	-LRB- cl .8 -RRB- The vessel was to have the liberty to deviate for the purpose of saving life and property -LRB- cl .16 -RRB- and by reason of the incorporation of the amended Hague Rules -LRB- v. inf . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	174	any other reasonable deviation was permitted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	175	-LRB- Art.IV r. 4 -RRB- The charterparty also incorporated no fewer than three clauses paramount but no point arose on their application -LRB- Adamastos Shipping Co. Ltd. v Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Co. Ltd. -LSB- 1959 -RSB- AC 133 -RRB- nor as to which one was relevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	176	It was accepted that their effect was to incorporate an exception for loss or damage arising from the act , neglect or default of the master in the navigation or management of the ship in Article IV rule 2 -LRB- a -RRB- of the amended Hague Rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	177	The charterers ' allegation was that the owners had been in breach of their obligation to prosecute the relevant voyages with the utmost dispatch and to comply with charterers ' orders to proceed by the shortest route . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	178	The owners ' response was that the orders and the choice of route did not relate to the employment of the vessel but to its navigation and all matters of navigation were within the sole province of the master to decide and , if he was in any way at fault , owners ' liability was excluded under Article IV rule 2 -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	179	The dispute therefore raised a question of the scope of the contrasting terms `` employment '' and `` navigation '' as used in this type of charterparty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	180	The arbitration was at the wish of the parties conducted on documents without an oral hearing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	181	The arbitrators described the principal issue in the arbitration as being whether the master 's decision to disregard the charterers ' instructions as to the course which he was to take on the two voyages in question was unjustifiable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	182	They referred to what appeared to be the background to the master 's attitude . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	183	In October 1993 , under a previous charterparty , the vessel had encountered heavy weather on a voyage from near San Francisco to a port in southern Japan and had suffered heavy weather damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	184	It was apparently this experience which had led the master in the following January and April to choose to follow a more southerly route from Vancouver to the east coast of Japan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	185	Indeed , in January 1994 , he gave this as his reason for refusing to obey the charterers ' order to proceed by the shortest route , that is to say the ` great circle ' or more northerly route , and preferring to go further south along the ` rhumb line ' where he might expect easier weather conditions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	186	Having considered the evidence , the -LRB- majority -RRB- arbitrators stated : `` We did not consider that this amounted to a satisfactory reason in itself for disregarding the Charterers ' instructions . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	187	As regards the April voyage , the only reason which the master gave was that the vessel 's auxiliary boiler was inoperative as it had broken down and not been repaired . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	188	This excuse if factually correct would have raised obvious difficulties for the owners as it involved saying that the vessel was not seaworthy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	189	But the arbitrators rejected the master 's excuse as spurious since the problem with the auxiliary boiler had been dealt with at Vancouver before the vessel sailed and no question of unseaworthiness could arise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	190	The arbitrators suspected that his true reason was the same as before . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	191	They said : `` In the case of the second disputed voyage , if the master 's decision had indeed been based upon the experience of -LSB- the 1993 voyage -RSB- , it was even more difficult to justify than his decision in relation to the first disputed voyage given the fact that the voyage commenced in late April when the weather could be expected to have been significantly better on the recommended -LSB- shorter -RSB- route . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	192	They concluded that `` the evidence had failed to demonstrate that the master had acted reasonably having regard to all the relevant circumstances in rejecting the charterers ' orders on both these voyages '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	193	The evidence to which the arbitrators were referring included independent evidence which they clearly accepted and which , as appears from the recitation in their Reasons , was uncontradicted by any other evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	194	The charterers ' orders as to the route were given after taking the advice of Ocean Routes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	195	Ocean Routes are a well established specialist commercial organisation of which the business is to assemble and record information about weather and sea conditions in the oceans of the world at different times of year and accordingly to advise those involved in the marine transportation industry as to the most favourable routes to follow when crossing oceans . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	196	Thus when the arbitrators refer to the ` recommended ' route they are referring to the route recommended by Ocean Routes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	197	The evidence accepted by the arbitrators was that in the period March to May 1994 Ocean Routes had provided advice to some 360 vessels routed from the Pacific north west to northerly China Korea or Japan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	198	All of these vessels had sailed on a northerly route . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	199	The only vessels that did not do so were vessels which were proceeding to destinations far to the south of Japan such as Singapore or the Philippines . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	200	There was no evidence of any particular difficulties encountered by the vessels which had taken the northern route during the relevant period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	201	The -LRB- majority -RRB- arbitrators found that the owners were in breach of their obligation under the charterparty to ensure that the master prosecuted the voyages with the utmost dispatch and followed the charterers ' orders regarding the employment of the vessel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	202	They then considered the defence ` error ' in navigation -LRB- sic -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	203	Following what they understood was the effect of the decision in S.S. Lord -LRB- Owners -RRB- v Newsum Sons & Co. Ltd. -LSB- 1920 -RSB- 1 KB 846 , they concluded that the planning of the voyage was not a matter of navigation ; it was not a case where the master had decided to alter course at sea . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	204	Clarke J adopted a diametrically opposite approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	205	He held that the dispute related to matters of navigation not to matters of employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	206	It followed that the orders were not ones which the charterers were entitled to give and the decision what route to follow was one for the master alone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	207	If any liability had arisen it would have been covered by the exception . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	208	At pp.81-2 , he said : `` In my judgment an order as to where the vessel was to go , as for example to port A or B to load or discharge or to port A or port B via port C to bunker , would be an order as to employment which the master would be bound to follow , subject of course -LRB- as all parties agreed -RRB- to his overriding responsibility for the safety of his ship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	209	An order as to how to get from where the ship was to port A , B or C would not , however , be an order as to employment but an order as to navigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	210	So , for example , to take an illustration discussed in argument , a direction to a master proceeding to a port of discharge to pass , say , on one side or another of a light vessel or an island or to proceed by way of one channel rather than another would be a direction as to navigation not employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	211	There can I think be no real doubt that a decision by a master as to which channel to take , what course to set or which side of an island or light vessel to go , would be a decision as to navigation and not as to employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	212	The same must be true of an order or direction to the master in any of those respects . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	213	In my judgment those considerations lead to the conclusion that a decision whether to proceed across the Pacific by taking the great circle route or the rhumb line route or course would also be a decision in an about the navigation of the vessel and not in and about her employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	214	It is true , as the arbitrators say and as has been urged in argument , that one decision or the other would be likely to have important financial consequences for the charterers -LRB- and perhaps also the owners -RRB- , but that is true of many decisions which masters take . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	215	He therefore was able to discard as irrelevant the arbitrators ' view that the decisions of the master were unreasonable and unjustified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	216	`` That might have been a good decision or a bad decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	217	It might have been justified or -LRB- as the arbitrators held -RRB- unjustified but it was not , in my judgment , a decision as to the employment but as to the navigation of the vessel . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	218	As regards whether the master had failed to prosecute the voyages with the utmost dispatch , Clarke J apparently concluded that the arbitrators had not found that he had failed to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	219	He said that they had not considered it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	220	-LRB- p. 88 -RRB- In the Court of Appeal , the leading judgment , agreed to by the other members of the Court , was given by Potter LJ . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	221	He held that the ocean route to be followed by the vessel was a matter of navigation for the master and not a matter of employment upon which the charterers could give the master orders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	222	Provided that the master acted bona fide , it did not matter whether he acted reasonably because the owners were protected by the exception in Article IV rule 2 -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	223	He summarised his decision at pp.261-2 : `` It seems to me , as Mr Hamblen -LSB- for the owners -RSB- submitted , that the master 's decision was a decision on navigation because it was a decision upon what course or combination of courses to follow in prosecuting the overall voyage , and because the reason for the decision , made bona fide , was the master 's concern for the safety of the vessel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	224	... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	225	So far as the application of Article IV rule 2 -LRB- a -RRB- is concerned , I consider that the judge was right in construing the term ` navigation ' as therein appearing as extending to a decision taken , in the course of voyage planning to steer a particular course or courses having regard to the weather to be anticipated . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	226	These judgments of two such experienced judges are entitled to great respect but so is the decision of the commercial shipping arbitrators to whom the parties agreed that the resolution of their dispute should be entrusted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	227	It should also be appreciated that the decision of Clarke J has been forcefully criticised by the late Mr Davenport QC in 1998 LMCLQ 502 and that the Court of Appeal decision has been similarly criticised from a commercial point of view at 1999 LMCLQ 461 by Mr Donald Davies , a highly experienced and legally qualified London maritime arbitrator who has also had experience as a master mariner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	228	Similarly , Mr Young who appeared for the charterers was able to refer your Lordships to an award of maritime arbitrators in New York holding , on facts probably less favourable to charterers , that the master was not entitled to choose , contrary to the wishes of the charterers , to proceed across the Pacific by a longer and more southerly route . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	229	The question raised by this dispute is not a new one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	230	It reflects the conflict of interest between owners and charterers under a time charter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	231	Under a voyage charter the owner or disponent owner is using the vessel to trade for his own account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	232	He decides and controls how he will exploit the earning capacity of the vessel , what trades he will compete in , what cargoes he will carry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	233	He bears the full commercial risk and expense and enjoys the full benefit of the earnings of the vessel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	234	A time charter is different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	235	The owner still has to bear the expense of maintaining the ship and the crew . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	236	He still carries the risk of marine accidents and has to insure his interest in the vessel appropriately . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	237	But , in return for the payment of hire , he transfers the right to exploit the earning capacity of the vessel to the time charterer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	238	The time charterer also agrees to provide and pay for the fuel consumed and to bear the disbursements which arise from the trading of the vessel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	239	The owner of a time chartered vessel does not normally have any interest in saving time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	240	An exception is where towards the end of a time charter , the expiry of the charter depends upon whether voyages can or can not be performed within the allotted period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	241	In such a situation the owners ' interest will vary depending upon whether the charter rate is above or below the current market rate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	242	There have been a succession of statements by experienced commercial judges which refer to these features of charterparties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	243	To quote Lord Mustill in The Gregos -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 1 Lloyd 's Rep. 1 at p. 4 , `` 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	244	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	245	in merchant shipping time is money . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	246	A cargo ship is expensive to finance and expensive to run . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	247	The shipowner must keep it earning with the minimum of gaps between employments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	248	Time is also important for the charterer , because arrangements must be made for the shipment and receipt of the cargo , or for the performance of obligations under sub-contracts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	249	These demands encourage the planning and performance of voyages to the tightest of margins . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	250	Yet even today ships do not run precisely to time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	251	The most prudent schedule may be disrupted by regular hazards such as adverse weather or delays in port happening in an unexpected manner or degree , or by the intervention of wholly adventitious events . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	252	Where the charter-party is for a period of time rather than a voyage , and the remuneration is calculated according to the time used rather than the service performed , the risk of delay is primarily on the charterer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	253	For the shipowner , so long as he commits no breach and nothing puts the ship off-hire , his right to remuneration is unaffected by a disturbance of the charterer 's plans . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	254	It is for the latter to choose between cautious planning , which may leave gaps between employments , and bolder scheduling with the risk of setting aims which can not be realized in practice . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	255	... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	256	This conflict of interest becomes particularly acute when there is time left for only one more voyage before the expiry of the charter , and disputes may arise if the charterer orders the ship to perform a service which the shipowner believes will extend beyond the date fixed for redelivery . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	257	What might be described as the scheduling of the vessel is of critical importance to the charterer so that obligations to others can be fulfilled , employment opportunities not missed and flexibility maintained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	258	The ` utmost dispatch ' clause is , as Lord Sumner said in Suzuki & Co. Ltd. v J. Benyon & Co. Ltd. -LRB- 1926 -RRB- 42 TLR 269 at p. 274 , a merchants ' clause with the object of giving effect to the mercantile policy of saving time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	259	As a matter of this mercantile policy and , indeed , as a matter of the use of English a voyage will not have been prosecuted with the utmost dispatch if the owners or the master unnecessarily chooses a longer route which will cause the vessel 's arrival at her destination to be delayed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	260	If the charterer has sub-voyage-chartered the vessel to another or has caused bills of lading to be issued , the charterer will be under a legal obligation to ensure that the voyage be prosecuted without undue delay and without unjustifiable deviation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	261	The charterer is entitled to look to the owner of the carrying vessel to perform this obligation and that is one of the reasons why the ` utmost dispatch ' clause is included in the usual forms of time charter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	262	Suppose that the charterer does no more than order the vessel to load at Vancouver and proceed to a port on the east coast of Japan , that order would give rise to an obligation under the clause to proceed from one port to the other with the utmost dispatch and is inconsistent with a liberty to delay the vessel by going by a longer than necessary route . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	263	To proceed by an unnecessarily long route delays the vessel just as surely as if the vessel had sailed at something less than full speed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	264	There may of course be countervailing factors such as adverse currents or headwinds which may make an apparently longer route in fact the more expeditious route but , on the arbitrators ' findings , none of those factors justified taking the longer route in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	265	Another difficulty for the owners ' argument is the fact that the owners have already agreed in the charterparty what are to be the limits within which the charterers can order the vessel to sail , for present purposes the Institute Warranty Limits , and have undertaken that , barring unforeseen matters , the vessel will be fit to sail in those waters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	266	It is not open to the owners to say that the vessel is not fit to sail from Vancouver to Japan by the shortest route within IWL . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	267	Yet it was exactly this type of argument which the courts below entertained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	268	In fact , upon the findings of the arbitrators , the vessel was fit to sail by the shorter northern route and the master did not have any good reason for preferring the longer southern route . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	269	It was not a good reason that he preferred to sail through calm waters or that he wanted to avoid heavy weather . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	270	Vessels are designed and built to be able to sail safely in heavy weather . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	271	The classification society rules require , as does clause 1 of the NYPE Form , the maintenance of these safety standards . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	272	It is no excuse for the owners to say that the shortest route would -LRB- even if it be the case -RRB- take the vessel through the heavy weather which she is designed to be able to encounter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	273	The courts below discussed the question of deviation under bill of lading contracts or voyage charterparties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	274	This was not directly material to a time charter where the contract is not a contract of carriage but a contract for the provision of the services of a crewed vessel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	275	However there is a relationship between prosecuting a voyage with the utmost dispatch and doing so without unjustifiable deviation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	276	Thus , in relation to a voyage charter , Lord Porter said , Reardon Smith Line Ltd. v Black Sea and Baltic General Insurance Co Ltd. -LSB- 1939 -RSB- AC 562 at p. 584 : `` It is the duty of a ship , at any rate when sailing upon an ocean voyage from one port to another , to take the usual route between those two ports . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	277	If no evidence be given , that route is presumed to be the direct geographical route , but it may be modified in many cases for navigational or other reasons , and evidence may always be given to show what the usual route is , unless a specific route be prescribed by the charterparty or bill of lading . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	278	... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	279	In some cases there may be more than one usual route . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	280	It would be difficult to say that a ship sailing from New Zealand to this country had deviated from her course whether she sailed by the Suez Canal , the Panama Canal , round the Cape of Good Hope or through the Straits of Magellan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	281	Each might , I think , be a usual route . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	282	The question in that case was whether a visit to a bunkering port was a breach of the charterparty contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	283	There was evidence that it was usual for vessels loading at the loading port to proceed via the other port for bunkers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	284	Therefore there was no breach of the contract of carriage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	285	A number of points relevant to the present case arise from this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	286	Under the time charter the obligation is not simply to proceed by a usual route but to proceed with the utmost dispatch . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	287	Further , where the vessel should take on bunkers is , subject to emergencies , undoubtedly a matter for the charterers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	288	The provision of bunkers is the charterers ' responsibility and the charterers can give orders as to the bunkering ports to be visited ; no question of what is usual arises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	289	Again , Lord Porter points out that there may be more than one usual route for proceeding on a long voyage from one continent to another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	290	The argument of the owners , from which they did not resile , was that in this situation the choice between the usual routes was entirely a matter for the master and the charterers could not give orders as to which was to be chosen , say , via the Cape of Good Hope or via the Suez Canal , even though the charterers would have to pay the canal and port dues and pay for the fuel consumed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	291	-LRB- See also Mr Davenport QC , loc cit . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	292	The significance of such choices are commercial and relate to the exploitation of the earning capacity of the vessel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	293	They are within the ambit of the employment of the vessel and are matters about which time charterers can give orders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	294	A time charterer can give an order because he wants the vessel to be well positioned for a commercial opportunity or other commercial reason . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	295	A time charterer can order the chartered vessel to proceed at an economical speed ; the time charterer may be waiting for a cargo to become available or the laydays at a loading port may not begin until after a certain date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	296	But even if the courts below should have got involved , which they have not , in a discussion of what was the usual route across the Pacific from Vancouver to the east coast of Japan , the arbitrators ' Reasons were clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	297	The northerly route was the shortest route . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	298	There was no evidence that any other route was a usual route . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	299	There was evidence that the northerly route was the usual route to follow as it had been by 360 vessels over a three month period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	300	It was also incorrect to treat the case as if it left open the possibility that there had been a rational justification for refusing to proceed by the northerly route . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	301	The arbitrators found that the master did not have any rational justification for what he did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	302	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	303	it follows from what I have already said that , on the findings of the arbitrators , the charterers were , by ordering the vessel to proceed by the shortest and most direct route , requiring nothing more than was in any event the contractual obligation of the owners . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	304	Therefore the question whether the order was an order as regards the employment of the vessel is academic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	305	But it was in truth such an order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	306	The choice of ocean route was , in the absence of some over-riding factor , a matter of the employment of the vessel , her scheduling , her trading so as to exploit her earning capacity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	307	The courts below , by contrast , accepted the owners ' argument that it was necessarily a matter of the navigation of the vessel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	308	In support of this argument , the charterers primarily relied upon Larrinaga SS Co v The King -LSB- 1945 -RSB- AC 246 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	309	The vessel in question had suffered a marine casualty : in the early hours of 14 October 1939 , in a storm , she had stranded on a bank outside St Nazaire . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	310	She was at the time under requisition by the British Government on the terms of the T99A charterparty which effectively incorporated war risks insurance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	311	This insurance includes cover for accidents occurring during or the consequence of `` warlike operations '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	312	The vessel had at the time received an oral order from a Sea Transport Officer to vacate the berth and sail to join a convoy proceeding to the Bristol Channel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	313	As a result of the stranding the vessel was seriously damaged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	314	Her owners sought to recover the cost of repairs from the Government . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	315	They put their claim on two bases , neither of which succeeded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	316	First , they claimed that the casualty was a consequence of a warlike operation : it was not , nor was she engaged on such an operation at the time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	317	Secondly , they claimed under the charterparty indemnity clause on the basis that the casualty was caused by obeying an order regarding the employment of the vessel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	318	This too failed for a number of reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	319	The only order as regards the employment of the vessel was that requiring her to proceed from the French port to the English port ; that order did not cause the casualty ; in any event the order to leave St. Nazaire had been a naval order not an order of the charterer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	320	The relevant parts of the speeches are those relating to whether there was an order of the charterer regarding the employment of the vessel and whether the casualty was caused by that order or by the master 's navigation of the vessel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	321	The question of causation is a real one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	322	Lord Porter stressed this at pp.260-1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	323	He referred to the fact that employment related to the employment of the vessel and that the order had been to sail after discharge was complete . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	324	He said : `` But this order did not in a legal sense , and I doubt if such an order ever could , cause such a loss . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	325	... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	326	This wording left it to the master 's discretion to sail at a reasonable time thereafter , and in determining what is a reasonable time all such matters as the state of the weather and the exhaustion of the crew would properly be taken into consideration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	327	In these circumstances it can not be said that either of these orders caused the damage which the ship suffered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	328	A loss is not , under English law , caused by orders to make or by making a voyage because it occurs in the course of it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	329	Such a loss is merely the fortuitous result of the ship being at a particular place at a particular time , and in no legal sense caused by the charterers ' choice of port to which the ship is directed or their instructions to her master to proceed to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	330	But it was said that the ship sailed not by reason of the written order to proceed , but by the subsequent oral order , and that such an order did cause the loss , since it was the probable and contemplated result of sailing in unfavourable weather that the ship might suffer damage which , had the master been free to choose his own time , would probably have been avoided . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	331	This argument Lord Porter rejected , giving three reasons for doing so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	332	First , he drew a distinction between an order to sail from port ` A ' to port ` B ' and an order to sail at a particular time , the former being a direction as how the ship shall be employed and the latter relating to how she shall act in the course of that employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	333	His second reason was that , whilst a mere order to sail may be an order which the charterer is entitled to give , this still `` leaves it to the discretion of the master who is responsible for the safety of his ship to choose the time and opportunity for starting on his voyage '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	334	`` I know of no right on the part of a charterer to insist that the safety of the ship should be endangered by sailing at a time when seamanship requires her to stay in port . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	335	-LRB- p. 262 -RRB- An order from a naval authority could be different but that was not something for which the Government was liable as charterer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	336	His third reason was one of lack of legal causation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	337	-LRB- Later authorities confirm this need for a direct causal link : eg The White Rose -LSB- 1969 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 1098 . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	338	The other members of the House agreed with Lord Porter , Lord Wright adding , at p. 255 , that 'em ployment ' meant `` the services which the ship is ordered to perform '' and contrasting it with ` navigation ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	339	Lord Porter used the word ` seamanship ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	340	This word was also used by Lord Sumner in Suzuki v Benyon -LRB- sup -RRB- when describing what was encompassed by the exception for errors of navigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	341	That case concerned the master of a time chartered vessel which failed , without any good reason , to steam at full speed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	342	He said , 42 T.L.R. 269 , 274 : `` I see no ground for bringing the captain 's action or inaction under the head of navigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	343	... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	344	there is a real field in which the captain 's shortcomings would not fall within the exception clause 14 -LSB- ` negligence , default or error in judgment of the ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	345	master ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	346	in the management or navigation of the steamer ' -RSB- and yet would constitute a breach of his obligation to use dispatch under clause 9 -LSB- ` the captain shall prosecute all his voyages with the utmost dispatch ' -RSB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	347	The maintenance of full speed may often be part of the duty which those responsible for navigation have to perform , directly or by others , as , for example , in order to save a tide at a bar or to correct excessive leeway or deflection by currents , or to make the ship quick to answer her helm , or to make a course good against head winds , or what not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	348	Here , however , it is not pretended that the ship was handled in an unseamanlike manner , or that either ship or cargo was imperilled by the navigation that took place . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	349	Similarly , in the case The Renée Hyaffil , 32 TLR 83 -LRB- Evans P -RRB- , 42 TLR 660 CA , the vessel was supposed to be performing a winter voyage from the east coast of Spain to London laden with a cargo of fruit but the master did not wish to brave the weather in the Bay of Biscay even though it was no worse than might be expected for that time of year . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	350	He put into La Corunna and stayed there for 23 days . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	351	When sued , the owners sought to rely upon the exception neglect in the navigation or management of the vessel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	352	This defence failed both before the judge and in the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	353	`` That delay had nothing to do with the navigation or management of the ship as such . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	354	-LRB- per Swinfen Eady LJ , at p. 660 -RRB- The The Renée Hyaffil was cited in Lord v Newsum -LSB- 1920 -RSB- 1 KB 846 which was relied upon by the charterers but criticised by the courts below as being inconsistent with Carmichael v Liverpool Sailing Ship Owners Mutual Indemnity Association -LRB- 1887 -RRB- 19 QBD 242 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	355	In Lord v Newsum , the vessel was under a six month time charter made in 1916 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	356	She was ordered on a laden voyage to Archangel but had to abandon the voyage because the master chose to proceed by a route close to the coast of Norway and was held up by the presence of German submarines . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	357	If he had proceeded by a route further from the coast , as prescribed by the British Admiralty and by the Norwegian war risk insurers , she would have been able to complete the voyage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	358	The owners were held liable under the ` utmost dispatch ' clause . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	359	The ` navigation and management ' clause was held to provide no defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	360	Bailhache J said , at p. 849 : `` The deliberate choice , while in harbour , of one of two routes to be pursued can not , I think , be an error in the ` management ' or in the ` navigation ' of the ship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	361	There is no doubt sometimes great difficulty in drawing the line between what is and what is not ` navigation , ' but I think the line ought to be drawn in the way I have indicated and as excluding the deliberation by the master in port regarding the route by which he will proceed to his port of destination .

292	362	The decision was no doubt correct but the reasoning is certainly confusing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	363	The character of the decision can not be determined by where the decision is made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	364	A master , whilst his vessel is still at the berth , may , on the one hand , decide whether he needs the assistance of a tug to execute a manoeuvre while leaving or whether the vessel 's draft will permit safe departure on a certain state of the tide and , on the other hand , what ocean route is consistent with his owners ' obligation to execute the coming voyage with the utmost dispatch . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	365	The former come within the exception ; the latter does not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	366	Where the decision is made does not alter either conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	367	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	368	what I have said has the support of Staughton J in The Erechthion -LSB- 1987 -RSB- 2 Lloyd 's Rep. 180 at p. 185 where he distinguished between an order to proceed to a particular anchorage and lighten - 'em ployment ' - and taking the advice of the pilot as to where in that anchorage to drop the anchor - ` navigation ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	369	The owners have relied upon various insurance cases giving a broad interpretation to the use of the word ` navigation ' in policies and other insurance contracts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	370	These cases did not assist in the present case which is concerned with the use of the term in an exception clause in contracts of carriage and the amended Hague Rules and its interrelationship with the use of the word 'em ployment ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	371	The meaning of any language is affected by its context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	372	This is true of the words 'em ployment ' in a time charter and of the exception for negligence in the ` navigation ' of the ship in a charterparty or contract of carriage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	373	They reflect different aspects of the operation of the vessel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	374	'Em ployment ' embraces the economic aspect - the exploitation of the earning potential of the vessel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	375	` Navigation ' embraces matters of seamanship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	376	Mr Donald Davies in the article I have referred to suggests that the words ` strategy ' and ` tactics ' give a useful indication . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	377	What is clear is that to use the word ` navigation ' in this context as if it includes everything which involves the vessel proceeding through the water is both mistaken and unhelpful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	378	As Lord Sumner pointed out , where seamanship is in question , choices as to the speed or steering of the vessel are matters of navigation , as will be the exercise of laying off a course on a chart . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	379	But it is erroneous to reason , as did Clarke J , from the fact that the master must choose how much of a safety margin he should leave between his course and a hazard or how and at what speed to proceed up a hazardous channel to the conclusion that all questions of what route to follow are questions of navigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	380	The master remains responsible for the safety of the vessel , her crew and cargo . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	381	If an order is given compliance with which exposes the vessel to a risk which the owners have not agreed to bear , the master is entitled to refuse to obey it : indeed , as the safe port cases show , in extreme situations the master is under an obligation not to obey the order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	382	The charterers ' submissions in the present case and the arbitrator 's Reasons and decision did not contravert this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	383	In the present case , the exception did not provide a defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	384	First , the breach of contract was the breach of both aspects of the owners ' obligations under clause 8 of the time charter - to prosecute the voyage with the utmost dispatch and to comply with the orders and directions of the charterers as regards the employment of the vessel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	385	As a matter of construction , the exception does not apply to the choice not to perform these obligations : Knutsford Steamship Co. v Tillmanns & Co. -LSB- 1908 -RSB- AC 406 ; Suzuki v Beynon -LRB- sup -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	386	In the words of Lord Loreburn LC at -LSB- 1908 -RSB- AC p. 408 : the master `` simply broke his contract , interpreting it erroneously '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	387	In the same case , at p. 410 , Lord Dunedin said , referring to the exception of error of judgment in navigating the ship or otherwise : `` It seems to me fantastic to extend it to the idea of a captain forming a wrong legal opinion on the meaning of a clause in the bill of lading and then proceeding to act upon it . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	388	-LRB- See to the same effect Kennedy LJ in the Court of Appeal at -LSB- 1908 -RSB- 2 KB 406-7 . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	389	Secondly , any error which the master made in this connection was not an error in the navigation or management of the vessel ; it did not concern any matter of seamanship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	390	Thirdly , the owners failed to discharge the burden of proof which lay upon them to bring themselves within the exception . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	391	This was clearest with regard to the second of the two relevant voyages where the arbitrators could only guess at , `` suspect '' , why it was that the master acted as he did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	392	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	393	the courts below were wrong to set aside the award of the arbitrators . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	394	Their award was not erroneous in point of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	395	The interpretation which they placed upon the utmost dispatch and employment clause was one which was open to them and it was likewise right for them , on the view they took of the state of the evidence , to conclude that the defence was not made out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	396	The arbitrators ' role in deciding a dispute of this kind draws upon their experience of the shipping industry and the problems it gives rise to . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	397	Their description of the commercial character of the bargain struck in a time charter echoed that of Lord Mustill already quoted and is the same as that which I have attempted to explain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	398	They stressed that if the owners wished to rely upon the navigation defence they must explain their position and justify what they had done . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	399	In so far as the arbitrators did have any explanation from the master , they rejected it as not providing any justification for not proceeding by the shorter northern route , the great circle route . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	400	The evidence of the recommendations of Ocean Routes was uncontradicted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
292	401	Accordingly the appeal should be allowed ; the respondents , Whistler International Ltd , should pay the costs of the appellants , Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd , in your Lordships ' House , in the Court of Appeal and in the Commercial Court , such costs to include any sums which Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd were ordered by Clarke J to pay in respect of the costs of Tokai Shipping Co Ltd ; and the order of Clarke J should be set aside and the award upheld . 	lord hobhouse	self	outcome	1	lord bingham, lord hobhouse
