33	15	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord steyn
33	16	This appeal was heard at the same time as the appeal in R v Rezvi in which the House deliver speeches today . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord steyn
33	17	In many respects the two appeals involve substantially similar questions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
33	18	Having regard to the conclusions and reasons in R v Rezvi it will be possible to deal with this appeal quite briefly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
33	19	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
33	20	In outline the circumstances of the appeal are as follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
33	21	On 8 September 1998 the appellant pleaded guilty to two counts of an indictment , thereby admitting that he had conspired with others to supply class A and B drugs between 6 May and 24 July 1997 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
33	22	On 19 October 1998 a Crown Court judge sentenced him to 14 years and five years respectively , the terms to run concurrently . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
33	23	A preliminary hearing to determine the extent to which the appellant benefited from drug trafficking took place between 29 and 31 March 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
33	24	On 1 July 1999 the court made a confiscation order in the sum of # 327,971 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
33	25	In default of payment of the said sum , a term of three years ' imprisonment was imposed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
33	26	On 5 October 1999 a High Court judge gave the appellant leave to appeal against the confiscation order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
33	27	On 6 December 2000 the appeal came before Lord Woolf CJ , Judge LJ and Collins J . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
33	28	The Court of Appeal considered the compatibility of section 4 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994 with the Human Rights Act 1998 which incorporated the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms into our law -LRB- Schedule 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord steyn
33	29	On 20 December 2000 the Court of Appeal -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 3 WLR 75 gave judgment on the application of articles 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- to confiscation proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
33	30	The Court of Appeal adjourned consideration of the merits of the appellant 's appeal to a later date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
33	31	On Thursday 8 March 2001 the adjourned hearing took place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
33	32	In a judgment which is unreported the Court of Appeal -LRB- Judge LJ and Collins J -RRB- dismissed the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
33	33	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
33	34	On this appeal the following issues arise for determination : -LRB- i -RRB- Whether a defendant who was the subject of criminal proceedings before the coming into force of sections 6 and 7 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- of the Human Rights Act 1998 is entitled , after they come into force , to rely , in the course of appellate proceedings , on an alleged breach of his Convention rights by the trial court or prosecuting authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
33	35	-LRB- ii -RRB- Whether a person against whom a confiscation order is sought under section 4 of the 1994 Act is `` charged '' with a criminal offence within the meaning of article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
33	36	-LRB- iii -RRB- If such a person is charged with a criminal offence , whether the reverse burden assumptions in section 4 of the 1994 Act are compatible with article 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Convention and/or article 1 of the First Protocol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
33	37	-LRB- iv -RRB- Whether it was appropriate and just to make the confiscation order in the circumstances of this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
33	38	The retrospectivity issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
33	39	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord steyn
33	40	The answer to issue -LRB- i -RRB- is No . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
33	41	The appellant pleaded guilty and was sentenced and a confiscation order was imposed on him before the 1998 Act came into force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
33	42	Following the decision of the House in R v Kansal , -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 3 WLR 1562 , it is now clear that the appellant 's Convention rights are not engaged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
33	43	Nevertheless , I will briefly summarise the position on the assumption that the Convention is applicable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
33	44	The criminal charge issue 7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
33	45	The answer to issue -LRB- ii -RRB- is No . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
33	46	Relying on the decision of the Privy Council in McIntosh v Lord Advocate -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 3 WLR 107 and the decision of a chamber of the European Court of Human Rights in Phillips v United Kingdom -LRB- Application No 41087/98 -RRB- 5 July 2001 , as well as on the relation between article 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and article 6 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- , I explained in R v Rezvi why the bringing of confiscation proceedings is not a criminal charge under article 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
33	47	There are material differences between the confiscation regimes under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 -LRB- applicable in R v Rezvi -RRB- and the 1994 Act -LRB- applicable in the present case -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
33	48	But in regard to the applicability of article 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- the position is the same . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
33	49	Article 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- does not apply to confiscation proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
33	50	But the appellant has the full protection of article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord steyn
33	51	Compatibility of reverse burden provisions with article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
33	52	It is unnecessary to set out the legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
33	53	Counsel for the appellant concentrated on the following provisions of the 1994 Act : `` 4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
33	54	-LRB- 1 -RRB- For the purposes of this Act - -LRB- a -RRB- any payments or other rewards received by a person at any time -LRB- whether before or after the commencement of this Act -RRB- in connection with drug trafficking carried on by him or another person are his proceeds of drug trafficking : and -LRB- b -RRB- the value of his proceeds of drug trafficking is the aggregate of the values of the payments or other rewards . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
33	55	-LRB- 2 -RRB- Subject to subsections -LRB- 4 -RRB- and -LRB- 5 -RRB- below , the Crown Court shall , for the purpose - -LRB- a -RRB- of determining whether the defendant has benefited from drug trafficking , and -LRB- b -RRB- if he has , of assessing the value of his proceeds of drug trafficking , make the required assumptions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
33	56	-LRB- 3 -RRB- The required assumptions are - -LRB- a -RRB- that any property appearing to the court - -LRB- i -RRB- to have been held by the defendant at any time since his conviction , or -LRB- ii -RRB- to have been transferred to him at any time since the beginning of the period of six years ending when the proceedings were instituted against him , was received by him , at the earliest time at which he appears to the court to have held it , as a payment or reward in connection with drug trafficking carried on by him : -LRB- b -RRB- that any expenditure of his since the beginning of that period was met out of payments received by him in connection with drug trafficking carried on by him ; and -LRB- c -RRB- that , for the purpose of valuing any property received or assumed to have been received by him at any time as such a reward , he received the property free of any other interests in it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
33	57	-LRB- 4 -RRB- The court shall not make any required assumption in relation to any particular property or expenditure if - -LRB- a -RRB- that assumption is shown to be incorrect in the defendant 's case ; or -LRB- b -RRB- the court is satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice in the defendant 's case if the assumption were to be made ; and where , by virtue of this subsection , the court does not make one or more of the required assumptions , it shall state its reasons . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
33	58	-LRB- Emphasis supplied -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
33	59	Making due allowance for the differences between the confiscation procedures under the 1988 Act and under the 1994 Act , the reasoning in R v Rezvi applies with equal force in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
33	60	The 1994 Act pursues an important objective in the public interest and the legislative measures are rationally connected with the furtherance of this objective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
33	61	The procedure devised by Parliament is a fair and proportionate response to the need to protect the public interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
33	62	The critical point is that under the 1994 Act , as under the 1988 Act , the judge must be astute to avoid injustice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord steyn
33	63	If there is or might be a serious or real risk of injustice , he must not make a confiscation order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
33	64	In these circumstances a challenge to the compatibility of the legislation must fail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
33	65	Article 1 of the First Protocol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
33	66	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
33	67	For the reasons given in Rezvi I would hold that any interference with article 1 of the First Protocol is justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
33	68	The merits . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
33	69	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
33	70	The main issue in the confiscation proceedings concerned two properties known as `` The Bentleys '' -LRB- which was in the appellant 's sole name -RRB- and `` La Siesta '' -LRB- which was in the joint names of the appellant and his mother -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
33	71	The question was whether the appellant 's father had provided the money for the purchase of the properties or whether the money was the appellant 's own income derived from drug trafficking . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
33	72	The appellant 's case was that his father completed a number of property sales between June and November 1986 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
33	73	The total realised moneys were in the region of # 92,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord steyn
33	74	The appellant contended that this figure would have constituted a sufficient pool for the purchase of the properties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
33	75	Summaries of the conveyancing files were provided to the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
33	76	The appellant submitted that these files suggested that his father had had sufficient funds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
33	77	The property was acquired when the appellant was 24 years old , several years before there was any direct evidence that he was involved in drug trafficking . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
33	78	Mr Heywood , the vendor of one of the properties , gave evidence that he thought the appellant was `` skint '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
33	79	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
33	80	On the other hand , the trial judge found that he was satisfied that Benjafield was at the head of a very considerable organisation dealing in large quantities of class A and class B drugs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
33	81	He was not an addict and was motivated purely through profit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
33	82	The appellant did not give evidence and so the judge was deprived of any explanation by him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
33	83	The appellant 's father was called to give evidence but the judge rejected his evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
33	84	The Crown 's case was that there was no evidence of the source of the funds for the appellant to buy the properties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord steyn
33	85	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
33	86	Counsel for the appellant argued that on the evidence the making of a confiscation order was inappropriate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
33	87	He said that it was probable that the appellant 's father paid for the properties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
33	88	The fact that the appellant did not testify is , however , a powerful point against him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
33	89	Collins J -LRB- with whom Judge LJ agreed -RRB- further observed , in paragraph 19 : `` The indictment covered the dates March to July 1997 , but it was clear from the conversations that were overhead that this appellant must have been involved in drug trafficking to a major extent for a period before that . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
33	90	He was , as the judge found , the prime mover , indeed the leader , of the enterprise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
33	91	As a matter of common sense it can be said that one does not get to that pinnacle in drug trafficking immediately , so it was clear that it would have been a perfectly proper inference to draw that this appellant had been engaged in drug trafficking for some time before May 1997 . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
33	92	And later Collins J added , in paragraph 46 : `` where the drug trafficking was at such a high level it is perfectly proper to conclude that it must have been going on for a considerable time before the appellant built himself up to reach the position that on the evidence he clearly did reach . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
33	93	For my part I see no reason to disagree with the reasoning of the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
33	94	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
33	95	A less than satisfactory aspect of the case is , however , that the judge had misdescribed his function by saying `` it has not been shown on the balance of probabilities that there was any risk of injustice '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
33	96	As is apparent from the judgments in R v Rezvi and on this appeal that is putting it too high . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord steyn
33	97	The judge must avoid any real risk of injustice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord steyn
33	98	But I am satisfied that no injustice or prejudice resulted from this misdirection as is convincingly shown by the careful review of the case by the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord steyn
33	99	Disposal 14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord steyn
33	100	I would dismiss the appeal . 	lord steyn	self	outcome	0.9	lord steyn
