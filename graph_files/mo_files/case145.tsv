145	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
145	4	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
145	5	This is an appeal from an interlocutor of an Extra Division of the Court of Session -LRB- Lords Marnoch , Hamilton and Philip , Lord Marnoch dissenting -RRB- dated 11 January 2005 -LRB- 2005 SLT 64 -RRB- , dismissing an appeal by the appellants , J & H Ritchie Limited , against an interlocutor of Sheriff Principal Iain Macphail QC dated 31 July 2003 , by which he allowed an appeal by the respondents , Lloyd Limited , against an interlocutor of the sheriff -LRB- Sheriff Kevin Drummond QC -RRB- dated 7 January 2003 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
145	6	In that interlocutor the sheriff granted decree for the sum sued for by the appellants in their action for repayment of the price paid for an item of agricultural equipment which they had purchased from the respondents and had rejected on the ground that it was not in conformity with the contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
145	7	The appellants carry on a farming business at North Arkleston Farm , Paisley . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
145	8	The respondents carry on business as suppliers of agricultural machinery at various locations in Scotland , including Hunters Hall , Kelso . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
145	9	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
145	10	The equipment , which was purchased from the respondents as a single item , incorporated a combination seed drill and a power harrow . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
145	11	It was part of a range of machinery manufactured by Amazone , whose administration centre is in Cornwall and sales , service and parts centre in Yorkshire . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
145	12	Although the seed drill and harrow were capable of being operated separately , the equipment had been advertised for sale in The Scottish Farmer as a single piece of equipment at a reduced price because it had been repossessed from a previous purchaser . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
145	13	Mr James Ritchie , a director of the appellants , responded to the advertisement by telephone on 12 February 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
145	14	The respondents agreed to make various modifications to it to suit the appellants ' requirements . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
145	15	A price of # 12,100 plus VAT was agreed for the equipment as modified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
145	16	The respondents agreed to sell it to the appellants for that price , which amounted in total to # 14,217.50 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
145	17	On 4 March 1999 the appellants issued a cheque for that sum in the respondents ' favour , and they took delivery of the equipment on the same day . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
145	18	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	19	The appellants began seeding on their farm on 26 April 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	20	They used the equipment for the first time that day . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	21	On 27 April 1999 it was noticed that vibration was coming from part of the harrow 's drive chain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	22	There was no obvious defect on visual inspection , so the appellants did not stop using it immediately . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	23	But when the vibration was still present on 28 April 1999 Mr Ritchie decided that there was a serious problem , and he stopped using the equipment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	24	He telephoned the respondents and spoke to a workshop supervisor , who arranged for a replacement unit to be delivered to the appellants the next day . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	25	On 29 April 1999 the harrow was removed from the equipment and replaced with a second-hand harrow to enable the appellants to complete their sowing operations for the season . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	26	After discussion between Mr Ritchie and the respondents ' fitter , Mr Thomas Fairley , the harrow was taken back to the respondents ' premises for inspection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	27	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	28	The harrow was stripped down and examined by the respondent 's fitter in their Kelso premises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	29	He found that the problem was due to the fact that two bottom bearings which ought to have been fitted to two of the rotors on the harrow were missing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	30	This was a major defect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	31	It made the equipment as a whole unfit for the purpose of tilling and sowing and not of satisfactory quality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	32	The fitter ordered the missing parts from the manufacturer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	33	When they arrived he inserted them into the harrow and it was reassembled . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	34	Some weeks after its removal to their premises the respondents telephoned the appellants and told them that the harrow had been repaired and was ready for collection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	35	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	36	There then followed a series of conversations between Mr Ritchie and various employees of the respondents which gave rise to this litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	37	They are important because no agreement was entered into prior to the removal of the harrow to Kelso as to what the consequences were to be once the defect had been identified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	38	Mr Ritchie did not know what the problem was . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	39	It was not yet clear that the appellants were entitled to reject the equipment on the ground that the respondents were in material breach of the contract : see section 15B -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 , which was inserted into the 1979 Act by the Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994 , section 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	40	So Mr Ritchie agreed to the respondents ' proposal that the harrow be taken back by them with a view to investigation and , if possible , repair . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	41	This was how Lord Hamilton described the arrangement which was entered into : 2005 SLT 64 , 73A-B , para 48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	42	The question whether the appellants would exercise their right of rejection if the inspection revealed that there was a material defect was left open until after the inspection had been carried out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	43	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	44	Mr Ritchie 's reaction on being told that the harrow was ready for collection was to ask the respondents ' workshop supervisor , Mr Raymond Elliot , what the problem had been with it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	45	Mr Elliot refused to tell Mr Ritchie . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	46	Having received no answer from Mr Elliot to his inquiry , Mr Ritchie had several telephone conversations with other employees of the respondents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	47	Despite Mr Ritchie 's requests , none of them would reveal what the nature of the problem was or what had been done to the harrow to repair it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	48	All he was told was that it had been repaired to what was described as `` factory gate specification '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	49	Mr Ritchie then asked for an engineer 's report on the harrow . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	50	This too was refused . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	51	He was told informally by persons involved in repairing the harrow that there had been bearings missing from it and that they had been omitted on manufacture . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	52	But he was not satisfied by this information . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	53	He was concerned for any consequences that the missing bearings could have had on the other parts of the harrow . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	54	The harrow had , of course , been used by the appellants on 26 , 27 and 28 April 1999 with the bearings missing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
145	55	Mr Ritchie was concerned that this might have damaged the machine in other ways . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	56	He was concerned too that , if he were to take the harrow back , it would not be used again until the following spring . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	57	Many months would go by until he would have the opportunity of discovering for himself whether the problem had been rectified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	58	He was also concerned as to the effect which this delay might have on the manufacturer 's guarantee period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	59	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	60	In the light of these concerns Mr Ritchie decided to reject the equipment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	61	He did so in a telephone conversation with the respondents , in which he told them that he was doing so because they had refused to provide him with the information that he was seeking . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	62	He then consulted the appellants ' solicitors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	63	By letter dated 26 May 1999 they confirmed that the appellants had rejected the equipment on the ground that the respondents were in breach of contract and asked them to return the price which the appellants had paid for it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	64	The respondents refused to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	65	They maintained that the effect of the repair to the harrow was to make it as good as it would have been if it had left the factory as a new , correctly assembled harrow . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	66	So it was the duty of the appellants to accept the equipment : see section 27 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	67	The proceedings below 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	68	The sheriff held that the appellants were entitled to reject the equipment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	69	He accepted Mr Ritchie 's evidence about his attempts to discover what was wrong with the harrow and what had been done to repair it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	70	In his opinion Mr Ritchie was entitled to be concerned about any consequential damage that might have followed from the material defect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	71	He held that these were legitimate concerns which , having regard to the course which events took , entitled the appellants to reject the equipment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	72	He did not include in his findings of fact a finding to the effect that the effect of the repair to the harrow was to make it as good as it would have been if had been correctly assembled when it left the factory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	73	On the view which he took of the case , a finding to that effect would not have deprived the appellants of the right to reject the equipment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	74	They were entitled to reject the equipment because there was a material defect in the harrow when it was delivered to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	75	It did not prevent the machinery from working , but it had the potential to limit the life of the equipment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	76	The appellants did not lose their right to reject the equipment by the use they made of it , as this was necessary to disclose the existence of the defect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	77	They retained that right because the respondents ' insistence that the harrow had been put back to factory gate standard had failed to answer the appellants ' concerns about consequential damage and the risk that the manufacturer 's guarantee would expire in the meantime , which were legitimate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	78	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	79	The Sheriff Principal was of the opinion that a number of changes needed to be made to the sheriff 's findings of fact . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	80	He decided to produce a new set of findings , incorporating these changes , which could be read as a single document . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	81	Among the new findings that he made was the following : He accepted that the defect in the harrow was a material defect which rendered the equipment unfit for the purpose of tilling and sowing , and that the appellants were entitled to reject it and treat the contract as repudiated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	82	He also accepted that the appellants did not lose their right to reject the equipment because they agreed to the removal of the harrow for inspection and repair : section 35 -LRB- 6 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 , as inserted by the Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994 , section 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	83	But in his opinion it was necessary to establish the state of the equipment at the time when , following the repair , the appellants rejected it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	84	The question then was whether the appellants still had the right to reject the equipment when the harrow was offered back to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	85	It was not enough for the appellants to have concerns about the equipment , however sincere these might have been . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	86	The effect of finding 19 was to show that their concerns were not well founded in fact . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	87	They had failed to prove that the equipment was not fit for its purpose at the time of the rejection , so it was their duty to accept it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	88	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	89	In the Inner House Lord Marnoch said that the appellants , having acquired a right to reject the goods at the time of delivery , could not have that right taken away from them simply by the renewed tendering of the goods in an allegedly repaired condition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	90	There was no provision to that effect in the 1979 Act : para 12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
145	91	If the respondents were to have an answer to the appellants ' claimed right of rejection , it was to be found in the doctrine of personal bar : para 14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	92	But no plea of personal bar had been taken against the appellants , and the argument that the appellants were obliged to accept the harrow when it was re-tendered to them after the repair without demonstrating its effectiveness was unsound . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	93	He would have allowed the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	94	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	95	Lord Hamilton and Lord Philip disagreed with Lord Marnoch . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	96	Lord Hamilton said that the result of the repair was to render the harrow fit for its purpose and , in the event of it being re-associated with the power drill , to render the equipment as a whole of satisfactory quality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	97	So at the stage when the appellants declined to receive the repaired harrow and sought to treat the contract as repudiated the respondents were not in breach of contract : para 48 : Lord Philip said that , as the appellants had declined to rescind the contract when the harrow was originally tendered , the contract remained in existence for the benefit of both parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	98	The duties to deliver and to accept the goods under section 27 of the 1979 Act continued to be incumbent on them : para 54 : As to the question what effect section 35 -LRB- 6 -RRB- had on this analysis , Lord Philip said that it was intended to be limited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	99	Its effect was to remove the risk that , by agreeing to a repair , a purchaser will be deemed to have accepted the goods . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	100	The result was that a seller of defective goods who agrees to repair them , but then fails to do so , can not demand payment of the price , or demand to retain it if it has already been paid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	101	Discussion 12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	102	The issue which lies at the heart of this case , as Lord Philip observed , is the effect of section 35 -LRB- 6 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 , as amended , on the buyer 's right to reject goods which , on delivery , are materially disconform to the contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	103	Section 35 as a whole is concerned with when the buyer is , and is not , deemed to have accepted the goods . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	104	Subsection -LRB- 6 -RRB- provides : Prior to the introduction of that provision into the 1979 Act it was open to question whether asking the seller to have defects in the goods remedied might amount to an implied intimation of acceptance by the buyer or to an inconsistent act which would prevent him from rejecting the goods . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	105	This problem was considered by the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	106	In a joint report on Sale and Supply of Goods -LRB- May 1987 , Law Com No 160 ; Scot Law Com No 104 -RRB- the Commissions said that they had decided not to recommend giving the seller a right to cure the goods : para 5.28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	107	Instead they recommended that the 1979 Act should be amended so as to provide that if the buyer asks for or agrees to attempts being made to repair the goods -LRB- whether by the seller or under an arrangement with him -RRB- , then this does not of itself amount to acceptance of the goods by the buyer : para 5.29 : 13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	108	While the solution which the Commissions recommended to encourage attempts at cure solved one problem , it is apparent from this case that it created another for which no solution was provided . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	109	What happens to the right of rejection if the repair which the buyer has asked for or agreed to is carried out ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	110	The buyer is not deemed to have accepted the defective goods merely because he asked for or agreed to their repair . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	111	But is he bound in every case to accept and pay for the goods simply because they are said by the seller , following their repair , to be conform to the contract ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	112	If not , in what circumstances does the buyer lose the right to reject , and in what circumstances does that right remain exercisable ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	113	Wisely , as it now appears , the Commissions did not attempt to grapple with this problem . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	114	A solution can not be found in the authorities which were cited to your Lordships , none of which were concerned with it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	115	The problem is not capable of being solved satisfactorily by a pre-ordained code . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	116	In the absence of express agreement , the answer to it must depend on what terms , if any , are to be implied into the contract at this stage , bearing in mind that the seller was in breach at the time of delivery and that the buyer retains the right to resile because the goods were not in conformity with the contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	117	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	118	In William Morton & Co v Muir Brothers & Co , 1907 SC 1211 , 1224 Lord McLaren said : In Liverpool City Council v Irwin -LSB- 1977 -RSB- AC 239 , 258A-C Lord Cross of Chelsea pointed out that there was an important distinction between laying down by this means a prima face rule applicable to all cases of a defined type and cases where what the court was being in effect asked to do was to rectify a particular contract by inserting in it a term which the parties have not expressed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	119	Dealing with the latter kind of case , he said at p. 258B-C : 15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	120	The present context is one where it would , in my opinion , be not at all out of place to resort to an implied term to fill the gap in the statutory code and govern the relationship between the parties when it was arranged that the harrow would be taken back to Kelso . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	121	What term , if any , it would be right to imply into the contract of sale at that stage will depend on the circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	122	There may be cases , for example , where the nature of the defect and exactly what needs to be done to correct it , and at what expense to the seller , are immediately obvious to both parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	123	It may then be said that a buyer who , having been equipped with all that knowledge , allows the seller to incur the expense of repair is under an implied obligation to accept and pay for the goods once the repair has been carried out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	124	His right to resile will be lost when the repair has been completed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	125	The buyer 's protection is the reasonable opportunity to examine the goods after delivery which he is given by section 35 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1979 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	126	Lord Marnoch said in para 14 that the doctrine of personal bar would provide the answer if the buyer claimed the right to reject in such circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
145	127	But , as we are dealing here with a statutory code and its consequences , I would prefer to find the solution in an implied term . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	128	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	129	That however is not this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	130	The nature of the defect was not immediately obvious and it was not known what , if anything , could be done to correct it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	131	But the underlying principles are the same . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	132	The effect of section 35 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- is that , as the buyer is not deemed to have accepted the goods , he retains the right to reject them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	133	That right will , of course , be lost if , at any time , he decides to accept the goods or is deemed to have accepted them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	134	But it is a right of election which the buyer can not be expected to exercise until he has the information that he needs to make an informed choice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	135	The seller , for his part , can not refuse to give him the information that he needs to exercise it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	136	As Hale LJ said in Clegg v Andersson t/a Nordic Marine -LSB- 2003 -RSB- 2 Lloyd 's Rep 32 , 48 , para 75 : 17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	137	Clegg v Andersson was a case where the buyer had asked for information which the seller agreed to give him and had not yet decided whether or not to ask for , or agree to , remedial works to the defective goods . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	138	In this case the appellants took that further step without first obtaining an undertaking from the respondents to provide them with information as to the nature of the defect once the harrow had been inspected and what had been done to repair it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	139	It is plain that they would have been entitled to exercise their right of rejection if , on being asked to give such an undertaking in advance , the respondents had declined to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	140	Should the fact that it did not occur to Mr Ritchie to obtain an express undertaking to that effect before the harrow was taken away make any difference ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	141	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	142	The harrow was a complex piece of power operated agricultural machinery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	143	Information of the kind that Mr Ritchie was asking for was obviously needed if the appellants were to make a properly informed choice between accepting and rejecting the equipment on being told that the harrow had been repaired to factory gate standard . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	144	A condition that the seller would provide this information , if it was asked for , was one which every buyer would seek for his own protection in such circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	145	It was one which no reasonable seller , who was already in breach of contract , could refuse as a condition of being given the opportunity to cure the defect and preserve the contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	146	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	147	In these circumstances - which can not be assumed to apply in every case - I would hold that the respondents were under an implied obligation to provide the appellants with the information that Mr Ritchie asked for . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	148	As they refused to give them that information the respondents were in breach of that obligation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	149	The appellants were deprived of the information that they needed to make a properly informed choice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	150	In my opinion they were entitled to reject the equipment even although , as it turned out , the respondents were able to prove afterwards that the harrow had been repaired to factory gate standard . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	151	Conclusion 20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
145	152	For these reasons I would allow the appeal . 	lord hope	self	outcome	0.4	NAN
145	153	I would sustain the appellants ' first and fourth pleas in law and repel the fourth , fifth and seventh pleas in law for the respondents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

145	163	LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	164	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	165	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	166	The appellants are a company carrying on a farming business near Paisley . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	167	In 1999 one of the directors , Mr James Ritchie , saw an advertisement in which the respondents were offering a drill and power harrow combination for sale . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	168	On or about 12 February the appellants entered into a contract with the respondents to buy the equipment comprising the specific drill and harrow , somewhat modified , for a total price of # 14,217.50 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	169	On 4 March they paid the price and collected the equipment from the respondents ' premises in Kelso . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	170	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	171	The equipment was used for the first time on 26 April . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	172	The following day Mr Ritchie noticed vibrations in the harrow and , when they persisted on 28 April , he stopped using the equipment and contacted the respondents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	173	He spoke to their workshop supervisor , Mr Elliot , who arranged for a replacement unit to be sent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	174	On 29 April the respondents ' fitter , Mr Fairley , arrived at the farm . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	175	With Mr Ritchie 's agreement , he removed the harrow and replaced it with a second-hand harrow so as to allow Mr Ritchie to complete the spring sowing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	176	Again with Mr Ritchie 's agreement , Mr Fairley took the harrow back to Kelso to inspect it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	177	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	178	In his Note the sheriff principal said that on 29 April Mr Ritchie had agreed `` to the removal of the harrow for inspection and repair '' by the respondents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	179	But that can not actually be so since , at the stage when the harrow left the farm , neither Mr Ritchie nor Mr Fairley knew what was wrong with it or whether the respondents could repair it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	180	For that reason I prefer Lord Hamilton 's description of Mr Ritchie agreeing to the harrow being taken back by the respondents `` with a view to investigation -LRB- and possible repair -RRB- '' : 2005 SLT 64 , 73A , para 48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	181	In substance , he agreed that the respondents should take the harrow back to Kelso , inspect it and , if possible , repair it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	182	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	183	When Mr Fairley stripped down the harrow , he found that the vibrations had been caused by the absence of two bearings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	184	The respondents obtained the necessary bearings and fitted them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	185	Some weeks after the harrow had been removed , Mr Elliot telephoned Mr Ritchie and told him that it was ready for collection , but refused to tell him what had been wrong with it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	186	Although Mr Ritchie eventually discovered informally what the problem had been , despite repeated requests , no-one at the respondents was willing to tell him officially . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	187	He was simply told that it had been repaired to `` factory gate specification '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	188	In finding 19 the sheriff principal found that the repair had indeed made the harrow conform to `` factory gate standard '' , ie , it was as good as it would have been if it had left the factory as a new , correctly assembled , harrow . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	189	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	190	Mr Ritchie was worried , however , in case operating it without the two bearings might have affected other parts of the harrow . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	191	Moreover , since he would not have occasion to use the equipment again until the following spring , he would not know till then whether the problem had indeed been rectified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	192	He was also worried about the possible effects of these events on the guarantee period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	193	He asked the respondents for an engineer 's report , but they refused to provide one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	194	Mr Ritchie then rejected the equipment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	195	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	196	In the present proceedings , which started life in the sheriff court at Jedburgh , the appellants seek decree of declarator that they validly rescinded the contract of sale of the equipment and decree for repayment of the price . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	197	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
145	198	The sheriff found in favour of the appellants , but the sheriff principal heavily revised his findings in fact , recalled his interlocutor and granted decree of absolvitor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	199	The Court of Session refused the appellants ' appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	200	In the course of the hearing before the Inner House , the appellants ' counsel unsuccessfully challenged the sheriff principal 's finding 19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	201	In their written cases before this House the appellants and respondents joined battle once more over whether the sheriff principal had been entitled to make finding 19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	202	When , however , Mr Graham QC began to develop the point in his oral submissions for the appellants , your Lordships stopped him because , as section 32 -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the Court of Session Act 1988 provides , in a case where a proof has been held in the sheriff court , appeal lies to this House only on matters of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	203	In terms of section 32 -LRB- 4 -RRB- the facts on which the House is to proceed should be set out in the interlocutor of the Inner House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	204	Unfortunately , in this case - as in another which was recently before your Lordships ' House - the Inner House overlooked the requirements of subsection -LRB- 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	205	In the interests of simplicity and to avoid misunderstandings , in future the court should ensure that their interlocutors comply with the statutory requirement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	206	In the present case , since the Extra Division did not purport to alter the sheriff principal 's interlocutor , your Lordships must proceed on the facts which he found , including finding 19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	207	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	208	By allowing the appellants to take possession of the equipment , the respondents fulfilled their duty to deliver it to the appellants : sections 27 and 29 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 -LRB- `` the Act '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	209	In terms of the parties ' contract , property in the equipment was not to pass until the price was paid in full . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	210	So , when the price was paid on 4 March , property in the equipment passed to the appellants : section 17 of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	211	It follows that , when the equipment developed the fault , it was the appellants ' harrow which Mr Fairley took away to inspect and , if possible , repair . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	212	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	213	The respondents accept that the fault in the harrow was such that , on 29 April , they were in material breach of their contract of sale with the appellants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	214	So it would have been open to the appellants to terminate , ie , rescind , the contract , send the equipment back and demand the return of the price . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	215	If , when aware of the defect , the appellants had still decided to accept the equipment , they would have been unable subsequently to rescind the contract and reject the equipment : they could only have sued the respondents for damages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	216	In fact , however , Mr Ritchie agreed to Mr Fairley detaching the appellants ' harrow and removing it for inspection and for repair , if possible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	217	Under section 35 -LRB- 6 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Act , the appellants are not deemed to have accepted the equipment merely because they agreed to this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	218	So , as at 29 April , the appellants had not accepted the equipment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	219	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	220	Up to this point , the analysis of the legal effects of the events of 29 April is not controversial and is , in effect , common ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	221	There is much less agreement about the remaining legal aspects of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	222	This is not perhaps entirely surprising . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	223	In para 5.28 of their joint report on the Sale and Supply of Goods -LRB- -LRB- 1987 -RRB- Law Com No 160 ; Scot Law Com No 104 -RRB- , which led to the enactment of section 35 -LRB- 6 -RRB- , the Law Commissions expressed the view that informal attempts at curing defects in goods should be encouraged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	224	The agreement in the present case is typical of the kind of informal arrangement which they must have had in mind and it obviously made good sense for the parties to solve any problems in this way , if they could . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	225	Unfortunately , if the dispute eventually ends up in court , the very informality of such arrangements will tend to make the legal analysis of the situation correspondingly elusive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	226	The implications of the arrangements will need to be teased out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	227	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	228	It is true , of course , as Lord Philip remarked , 2005 SLT 64 , 73J-K , para 54 , that , since the appellants had not terminated the contract of sale , it remained alive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	229	So the respondents could have exercised any of their rights under that contract which remained to be exercised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	230	What they actually did was to repair the harrow . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	231	As Mr Tyre QC acknowledged at the very outset of his submissions , however , in so doing , the respondents were not exercising any right of theirs under the contract of sale . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	232	So , when Mr Fairley took the harrow away , that can only have been in terms of the separate agreement between the parties for the respondents to inspect and , if possible , repair the harrow to the standard required by the sale contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	233	Since the respondents were to do this free of charge , the contract thus formed would not constitute a locatio operis faciendi and is probably just to be regarded as some kind of innominate contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
145	234	Even so , it would be quite valid and would regulate the parties ' position on inspection and repair . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	235	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	236	It so happened that in this case it was convenient for the respondents to take the harrow back to their premises to inspect and repair it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	237	But in the case of a large or heavy piece of equipment , such as a generator which had to be fixed into the ground , it might well be impracticable to remove it from the buyer 's premises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	238	So , if the buyer agreed to a similar arrangement , any inspection and repair of that equipment would have to take place on site . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	239	Nevertheless , the legal analysis of the seller 's core obligations would be the same in the two situations : the seller would have to inspect and , if possible , repair the buyer 's equipment and then make it available once more to the buyer when the work was completed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	240	The only difference between the two situations would be that , where the seller took the equipment away , the contract would oblige him to look after it and to return it , or to make it available for the buyer to collect , when the repair had been completed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	241	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	242	What , then , was the effect , if any , of this agreement on the appellants ' right to rescind the contract of sale because of the respondents ' material breach ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	243	Merely entering into the agreement did not mean that the appellants had accepted the harrow and so extinguished their right to rescind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	244	But , equally clearly , it must have been an implied term of the inspection and repair agreement that , so long as the respondents were duly performing their obligations under it , the appellants were not to exercise their right to rescind the contract of sale . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	245	In particular , if , in accordance with the terms of that agreement , the respondents eventually repaired the equipment to the proper standard and duly made it available to the appellants , the appellants would not be entitled to rescind the contract of sale and reject the equipment because of the original breach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	246	A term to this effect would have been necessary to give the inspection and repair agreement business efficacy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	247	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	248	If , on the other hand , when Mr Fairley took the harrow back to Kelso , the respondents had decided that repairing it was going to be too much trouble and had decided to do nothing , the appellants could have rescinded the agreement on the ground of the respondents ' repudiatory breach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	249	Being thus freed from their implied obligations under that agreement , the appellants could then have forthwith rescinded the contract of sale on the basis of the respondents ' material breach in supplying the defective harrow . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	250	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	251	Therefore , when Mr Elliot told Mr Ritchie that the harrow was ready for collection , he was not exercising any right , or performing any obligation , under the contract of sale : he was making the harrow available for collection under the parties ' inspection and repair agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	252	But , though asked repeatedly , neither he nor anyone else in an official position in the respondents ' organisation would tell Mr Ritchie what had been wrong with the harrow . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	253	This eventually led to Mr Ritchie refusing to take the harrow back . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	254	So the crucial question is whether the respondents were under any obligation to tell Mr Ritchie what had been wrong with the harrow and , if so , whether their refusal to do so justified the appellants in rescinding the inspection and repair agreement and refusing to take the harrow back . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	255	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	256	Naturally enough , when Mr Ritchie agreed to Mr Fairley taking the harrow away , nothing was said about the respondents providing information to the appellants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	257	So , again , the question is whether a term obliging them to do so is to be implied into the agreement between the parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	258	Normally , when I put my clock in for repair , for instance , I do not stipulate that the clockmaker must tell me what is wrong with it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	259	But , usually , once he has inspected it , he will contact me to let me know what the problem is , how long the repair will take and what it is likely to cost , so that I can decide what to do . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	260	At the very least , I can not be expected to pay for a repair without knowing what I am paying for . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	261	So a term about supplying such information on request would be readily implied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	262	Here the appellants were not going to have to pay for the inspection and repair . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	263	So that basis for an implication is missing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	264	But other circumstances are relevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	265	The respondents were taking the appellants ' property to inspect it : an owner who surrenders his property for inspection in this way can surely insist on being told the outcome of the inspection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	266	More particularly , in this case , the respondents were the very people who had supplied the harrow in a defective state . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	267	The appellants were surely entitled , at the very least , to insist on being told what the respondents had now discovered which they had not discovered before they originally supplied the harrow . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	268	Moreover , a refusal by the respondents ' representatives to provide that information would inevitably undermine the appellants ' trust and confidence in the respondents ' due performance of the contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	269	In these circumstances I am satisfied that business efficacy required the implication of a term that , if asked , the respondents would tell the appellants what their inspection had shown to be wrong with the harrow and what they had done to put it right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
145	270	The respondents ' outright refusal to supply that information constituted a material breach of the inspection and repair agreement , entitling the appellants to rescind it and to refuse to collect the harrow , even though - as the sheriff principal found - it had actually been repaired to a factory gate standard . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	271	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	272	In addition , once the appellants had rescinded the inspection and repair agreement , with its implied term preventing them from exercising their right to rescind the sale contract during its currency , there was nothing to prevent them from exercising that right of rescission or termination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	273	Which is precisely what they did by their solicitors ' letter of 26 May 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	274	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	275	For these reasons , I would allow the appeal and , like my noble and learned friend , Lord Hope of Craighead , grant decree of declarator in terms of the first crave and decree for payment in terms of the third crave of the initial writ . 	lord rodger	self	outcome	0.8	NAN

145	281	I can accordingly express my own thoughts very briefly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	282	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	283	To my mind the central fact in this case is that the respondent sellers , having initially delivered a seriously defective piece of machinery and been permitted by the appellant buyers to take it back for investigation and possible repair , then adamantly refused to reveal the nature of the problem or what had been done to cure it and , later , refused an engineer 's report too . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	284	Small wonder that the appellants would not have the machine back notwithstanding the respondents ' bland assertion that it was now of `` factory gate specification '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	285	Mr Colin Tyre , QC for the respondents acknowledged in argument that this was `` not sensible commercial practice '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	286	Sensible commercial practice generally corresponds closely with reasonable behaviour under contract and to my mind the respondents here can only be regarded as having behaved thoroughly unreasonably . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	287	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	288	The question is , however , were the appellants still entitled to reject the machine -LRB- as undoubtedly they had been before agreeing to its investigation and possible repair -RRB- or were they now bound to take re-delivery , being left merely with a further opportunity to examine the machine , acquiring a fresh right of rejection only if it was again found to be materially defective ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	289	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	290	In holding that the buyers had lost their earlier right of rejection the majority in the Court of Session appear to me effectively to have ignored the particular circumstances in which the sellers had sought for a second time to force the buyers to accept the goods under section 27 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	291	That duty only arises if the seller delivers the goods `` in accordance with the terms of the contract of sale '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	292	The proposed second delivery here , even assuming the machine had by now been satisfactorily repaired , was not tendered in accordance with the terms of the original contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	293	Rather it was tendered in purported accordance with the terms -LRB- whatever they were -RRB- of the agreement under which the sellers had been allowed to take it back . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	294	Lord Hamilton -LRB- at para 37 of his judgment -RRB- expresses `` some sympathy for the position in which the appellant was put by the lack of candour on the part of the respondent 's management as to what had been discovered to be the initial defect in the harrow '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	295	But neither he nor Lord Philip appear to have attached any weight to the fact that the goods as first delivered had been seriously defective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	296	Rather they treated the case for all the world as if the buyers had simply agreed to permit the sellers to make delivery out of time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	297	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	298	The argument accepted by the majority -LRB- see para 45 of Lord Hamilton 's judgment , para 56 of Lord Philip 's -RRB- is , I believe , correctly summarised in paragraph 9 of Lord Marnoch 's dissenting judgment : One difficulty with this argument , as Mr Tyre recognised in his submissions before the House , is that it goes only part of the way towards meeting the problem identified by Lord Philip , that of `` a buyer who agrees to the repair of defective goods -LSB- keeping -RSB- the seller on the end of a string . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	299	The buyer could still on the majority 's approach reject the goods at a late stage of repair provided only that he did so before re-delivery was actually tendered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	300	More relevantly for present purposes , however , the majority 's approach -- in effect straightjacketing the case into the statutory framework without regard to the agreement under which the sellers were permitted to take the goods back for investigation and possible repair -- neglected to consider the all-important terms , express and implied , of that agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	301	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	302	If , following such an agreement , goods are to be accepted back after repair , buyers must surely be entitled to some assurance that the repairs have been properly carried out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	303	In this case , so far from that , the sellers ' refusal even to state what had been wrong can only have suggested they had something to hide and served therefore to arouse the buyers ' suspicions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	304	I have no doubt that in conducting themselves in this way the respondents breached a term properly to be implied into the repair agreement and thereby forfeited any right to compel the buyers to take delivery a second time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	305	I would so hold even had the agreement of 29 April 1999 been simply for ` repair if possible ' rather than , as it was , ` investigation and possible repair . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
145	306	46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

145	309	LORD MANCE	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	310	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	311	47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	312	Section 35 -LRB- 6 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- was introduced into the Sale of Goods Act 1979 by the Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994 to address the risk that a buyer who `` asks for , or agrees to , their repair by or under an arrangement with the seller '' might , merely thereby , lose the right to reject non-compliant goods delivered to him under the contract for sale -LRB- cf The Law Commission and Scottish Law Commission Report on Sale and Supply of Goods , Cmnd . 137 of May 1987 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	313	48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	314	However , the Act does not say that such an arrangement has no effect at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	315	Nor could it , since the nature and effect of any arrangement is a fact-specific matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	316	At one end of the spectrum , one can take the example of a material , but readily identified , defect , easily curable and with no possible consequential implications -LRB- e.g. an obviously defective or missing part in the case of a machine not yet used -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	317	In that event , an arrangement might be made for perhaps costly and time-consuming repair by the seller which would commit the buyer outright to accepting the goods if and when they were satisfactorily repaired and returned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	318	The arrangement would amount not to immediate acceptance -LRB- because that is the whole point of section 35 -LRB- 6 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- -RRB- , but to acceptance conditional upon satisfactory repair and return . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	319	49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	320	But that is not the present case , where the source of the problem experienced during three days ' use of the harrow was unknown and could not be ascertained on superficial examination even by the seller . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	321	In consequence the arrangement actually made on 29th April 1999 did not simply involve asking for or agreeing to repair . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	322	Instead , it was arranged that the seller would take the harrow away for inspection and , if possible , repair . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	323	50 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	324	Inspection might have shown that the problem was irreparable or so expensive to cure that the seller was not prepared to undertake any repair . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	325	In that case , the buyer could and would no doubt have rejected the harrow and drill , and would have had a claim against the seller for non-performance of the contract for sale . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	326	Or it might have shown that the problem was simple and inconsequential , in which case no doubt the harrow would have been repaired , returned and accepted by the buyer , provided of course that the repair was satisfactory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	327	In the present case , the problem proved to be quite serious : the harrow , one part of a repossession item sold as new , had not been fitted with bearings which it should ordinarily have had from manufacture . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	328	Not unreasonably , as the Sheriff found , the buyer , when it eventually learned this informally , had concerns about the consequential implications for other parts of the harrow of the harrow having run without these bearings for three days -LRB- on 26th , 27th and 28th April 1999 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	329	51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	330	The circumstance giving rise to this case is that the buyer was never given the chance to comment on the seller 's findings on inspection of the harrow . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	331	The next contact between seller and buyer after 29th April 1999 came only when the seller had obtained and installed new bearings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	332	The seller at that point -LRB- on or around 17th May 1999 -RRB- contacted the buyer and informed it that the harrow had been repaired and was ready for return . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	333	So it was only then that the buyer had the chance to air any concerns . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	334	The buyer not surprisingly asked what had been wrong with the harrow , but the seller was unwilling to say . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	335	Only informally did the buyer receive information from one of the seller 's employees that bearings had been missing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	336	The buyer then asked that the seller obtain and present an engineer 's report to show that there had been no consequential damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	337	This was refused . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	338	The buyer in these circumstances claimed on 26th May 1999 to reject the drill and harrow and to recover their price . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	339	52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	340	In my view , the buyer 's rejection was justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	341	The harrow was , after its delivery to the buyer and payment of the price in March 1999 , the buyer 's property and at the buyer 's risk , subject in each case to the buyer 's right to reject it as defective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	342	The arrangement made on 29th April 1999 was in the first instance for inspection by the seller of the buyer 's harrow , to ascertain the cause of a problem which the buyer had experienced in use . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
145	343	The parties no doubt hoped that satisfactory repair would be possible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
145	344	But in my view it was a natural implication of the arrangement made that the seller would , at least upon request , inform the buyer of the nature of the problem which required to be remedied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
145	345	Indeed , I would normally have expected the seller to report such information before any repair , although it is not necessary here to decide whether the implication went so far as to require this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
145	346	53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
145	347	By failing to report the result of the inspection , and by presenting the buyer with the fait accompli of repaired goods , the seller short-circuited the procedure I would have expected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
145	348	By refusing to inform the buyer of the cause of the problem on request after repair , the seller was on any view in breach of the implicitly agreed procedure , and also aroused suspicion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
145	349	By failing to agree to supply an engineer 's report , the seller lost the opportunity to persuade the buyer to accept the goods notwithstanding the seller 's failure to follow the procedure implicitly agreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
145	350	54 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
145	351	In my opinion , the failure to disclose the nature of the problem was on any view a material breach of the arrangement made on 29th April 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
145	352	Even assuming that the arrangement made on 29th April 1999 committed the buyer to accept the goods if and when the harrow could be and was satisfactorily repaired and returned , it was implicit that the buyer would be informed of the nature of the problem on request at that stage , if only to enable the buyer to decide when and how to examine or test the harrow in order to determine whether it had been satisfactorily repaired . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
145	353	Assuming , alternatively , that there was a duty to report the nature of the problem to the buyer before any repair , and that the buyer retained a right at that earlier point -LRB- by when the seller would have incurred very little if any extra expense -RRB- to decide whether to have the harrow repaired or to reject , the failure to disclose was material for even more fundamental reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
145	354	There may be other possible analyses , and it is not material in this case to consider precisely which analysis might apply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
145	355	All that here matters is that there was a duty to disclose which was not performed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
145	356	Even though the harrow after repair was -LRB- the Sheriff Principal found -RRB- in as good as new condition , the seller 's failure to follow the procedure implicitly agreed justified the buyer in refusing to accept the goods sold . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
145	357	The buyer was still prepared to accept the goods , if the seller at its expense obtained a clean engineer 's report , but the seller refused to do this either . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
145	358	The buyer was in this situation justified on 26th May 1999 in rejecting the goods . 	lord mance	self	outcome	1	NAN
