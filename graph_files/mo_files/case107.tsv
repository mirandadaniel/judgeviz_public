107	8	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope
107	9	The appellants in these conjoined appeals were at all material times the freehold owners of parcels of land at Sundorne to the east of Shrewsbury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope
107	10	I shall refer to them as `` the landowners . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hope
107	11	It will be convenient to refer to the land owned by Joseph Newell , Elspeth Georgina Longmore and William Hugh Longmore , the Executors of J.V. Longmore , as `` the Longmore land '' and to the land owned by Fletcher Estates -LRB- Harlescott -RRB- Limited as `` the Fletcher land . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
107	12	These parcels of land formed , in each case , part of larger areas of land in their respective ownerships . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
107	13	On 30 January 1986 the Secretary of State for Transport gave notice of the making of draft compulsory purchase orders for the acquisition of land including the Fletcher land and the Longmore land for the purpose of constructing the A49 by-pass to the east of Shrewsbury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
107	14	The date of entry in each case was 5 July 1990 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
107	15	The landowners then applied , on 19 October 1992 in respect of the Fletcher land and 4 December 1992 in respect of the Longmore land , under section 17 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Land Compensation Act 1961 for certificates of appropriate development . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
107	16	On 8 May 1993 the Borough Council issued certificates under section 17 -LRB- 4 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
107	17	In the case of the Fletcher land the certificate was for residential development . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
107	18	In the case of the Longmore land it was for residential and industrial development . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
107	19	The Secretary of State for Transport appealed against those certificates under section 18 of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
107	20	On 4 July 1996 , having considered the report by an Inspector following a public inquiry held under section 18 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Act in Shrewsbury , the Secretary of State for the Environment allowed the appeals , cancelled the certificates which the Borough Council had issued and replaced them with certificates issued under section 17 -LRB- 4 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
107	21	In the certificates which he issued the Secretary of State certified that , if the land were not proposed to be acquired by an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers , planning permission would have been granted for the road scheme for which the land was being acquired but that it would not have been granted for any other development . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
107	22	The landowners applied to the High Court under section 21 of the 1961 Act to quash the decisions of the Secretary of State to issue certificates under section 17 -LRB- 4 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
107	23	On 10 June 1997 Dyson J. ordered that the applications be allowed and that the decisions of the Secretary of State be quashed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
107	24	On 11 June 1998 the Court of Appeal -LRB- Nourse , Peter Gibson and Buxton L.JJ . -RRB- set aside the orders of Dyson J. and restored the decisions of the Secretary of State . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
107	25	Two issues were argued before the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
107	26	The first issue related to the date at which the determination of the certificates of appropriate alternative development under section 17 -LRB- 4 -RRB- had to be made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
107	27	The question was whether this was the date when notice was given of the proposal to acquire the interest in land by the authority possessing compulsory purchase powers , as was held by Dyson J. , or the date of entry to the land by the acquiring authority , as the Secretary of State had contended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
107	28	The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment of Dyson J. on this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
107	29	The second issue related to the assumption which has to be made by the local planning authority under section 17 -LRB- 4 -RRB- when it is considering the question whether planning permission would have been granted for development if the land were not proposed to be acquired by an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
107	30	The competing arguments on this issue were described by Dyson J. in the following passage in his judgment which , as Buxton L.J. observed in the Court of Appeal -LSB- 1999 -RSB- Q.B. 1144 , 1150C , provides a neat summary of the competing arguments : '' -LSB- The landowners -RSB- contended that the policies and facts applicable at the relevant date should have been viewed as if the bypass scheme had never been conceived at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
107	31	-LSB- The Secretary of State -RSB- contended that the policies and facts should be taken on the relevant date as if the scheme had been cancelled on that date , and not as if the scheme had never been conceived at all . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
107	32	Dyson J. upheld the landowners ' argument , but the Court of Appeal disagreed with him on this issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hope
107	33	It held that , in making its determination , the local planning authority had to disregard the proposal for acquisition only and not any fact or policy attributable at any time in the past to the underlying scheme . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
107	34	The Court of Appeal gave leave to appeal to the landowners against its decision that the orders of Dyson J. should be set aside . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
107	35	It granted leave to the Secretary of State to cross-appeal on the first issue as to the relevant date for the determination of the certificates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
107	36	The Secretary of State presented cross-appeals on this issue , and they were conjoined with the appeals which had been presented on the second issue by the landowners . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
107	37	But in his written case the Secretary of State intimated that he no longer wished to pursue his cross-appeals on the first issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
107	38	In the result it was common ground before your Lordships that the relevant date for the determination of a certificate of alternative development under section 17 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the Act of 1961 is the date of the notice that the interest in land is proposed to be acquired by an authority possessing powers of compulsory acquisition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
107	39	That is the date which is described in section 22 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
107	40	The issue on which your Lordships heard argument was the second issue , as to the assumption which has to be made by the local planning authority when it is determining the application for a certificate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
107	41	The statutory framework The certification by planning authorities of appropriate alternative development is an important part of the law relating to the assessment of compensation for the compulsory acquisition of interests in land which was consolidated by the Land Compensation Act 1961 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
107	42	Section 1 of that Act provides that questions of disputed compensation are to be determined by the Lands Tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
107	43	The provisions for determining the amount of compensation are set out in Part II of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
107	44	The basic rules are laid down in section 5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
107	45	Among these rules are rule -LRB- 1 -RRB- which states that no allowance shall be made on account of the acquisition being compulsory , and rule -LRB- 2 -RRB- which states that the value of land shall , subject to the qualifications in the remaining rules , be taken to be the amount which the land if sold in the open market by a willing seller might be expected to realise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
107	46	Section 9 adds to these basic rules another rule which is expressed in these terms -LRB- as amended by section 108 of and Schedule 11 to the Town and Country Planning Act 1968 -RRB- : `` No account shall be taken of any depreciation of the value of the relevant interest which is attributable to the fact that -LRB- whether by way of allocation or other particulars contained in the current development plan , or by any other means -RRB- an indication has been given that the relevant land is , or is likely , to be acquired by an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
107	47	Applying the Pointe Gourde principle -LRB- Pointe Gourde Quarrying and Transport Co. Ltd. v. Sub-Intendent of Crown Lands -LSB- 1947 -RSB- A.C. 565 -RRB- , the reverse situation is regulated by the common law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
107	48	The compensation can not include an increase in value which is due to the scheme underlying the acquisition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
107	49	So the whole question must be approached upon a consideration of the state of affairs which would have existed if there had been no scheme . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
107	50	But the value of land can not be determined under these rules without making assumptions about the planning permission , if any , which would have been granted for the development of the land if it were not proposed to be acquired compulsorily . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
107	51	Section 14 provides that the assumptions which are to be made for the purpose of assessing compensation are those set out in sections 15 and 16 , and that any planning permission which is to be assumed in accordance with any of the provisions of those sections is in addition to any planning permission which may be in force at the date of service of the notice to treat . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
107	52	These provisions must be read together with those in Part III of the Act relating to certificates of appropriate alternative development , with which they are linked in two ways . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
107	53	Section 14 -LRB- 3 -RRB- provides that , in determining whether planning permission for any development could reasonably have been expected to be granted in any particular circumstances , regard shall be had to any contrary opinion expressed in relation to that land in any certificate issued under Part III . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hope
107	54	This is a reference to a certificate issued under section 17 -LRB- 4 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- , which is conveniently referred to as a negative certificate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
107	55	Section 15 -LRB- 5 -RRB- provides that , where a certificate has been issued under Part III , it shall be assumed that any planning permission which , according to the certificate , might reasonably have been expected to be granted in respect of the land or part thereof would be so granted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
107	56	This is a reference to a certificate issued under section 17 -LRB- 4 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- , referred to as a positive certificate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
107	57	As Lord Bridge of Harwich explained in Grampian Regional Council v. Secretary of State for Scotland -LSB- 1993 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 1340 , 1343H-1344B : `` The sole purpose of the certification procedure is to provide a basis for determining the development value , if any , to be taken into account in assessing the compensation payable on compulsory acquisition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
107	58	If a positive certificate is issued , it is to be assumed that the certified permission would be granted , subject to such conditions and at such future time , if any , as may be specified in the certificate ... If a negative certificate is issued , `` regard is to be had '' to the negative opinion certified ... Although this is not conclusive , it is difficult to envisage a situation in practice in which the Lands Tribunal , when assessing compensation , could be persuaded to act on a contrary opinion to that certified by the planning authority or the Secretary of State on appeal . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
107	59	The certification procedure which Part III lays down is set out in section 17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
107	60	Subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- of that section , as substituted by section 65 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Planning and Compensation Act 1991 , provides that , where an interest in land is proposed to be acquired by an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers , either of the parties may apply to the local planning authority for a certificate under that section . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
107	61	That subsection must be read together with section 22 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Act of 1961 , which prescribes the circumstances in which , for the purposes of sections 17 and 18 , `` an interest in land shall be taken to be an interest proposed to be acquired by an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
107	62	There are three prescribed circumstances , namely -LRB- a -RRB- the publication or service of a notice of the making of a compulsory purchase order ; -LRB- b -RRB- the service of a notice to purchase under any enactment ; and -LRB- c -RRB- the making of an offer to negotiate for the purchase by or on behalf of the authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
107	63	In the present case the landowners ' interests in the Fletcher land and the Longmore land respectively became interests in land which were `` proposed to be acquired by an authority possessing compulsory powers '' for the purposes of section 17 when the Secretary of State gave notice on 30 January 1986 of the making of the draft compulsory purchase orders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
107	64	The procedure which section 17 lays down deals with the making of the application for the certificate and its determination by the local planning authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
107	65	The relevant provisions , as substituted -LRB- in the case of subsection -LRB- 4 -RRB- -RRB- by section 65 of the Act of 1991 , are these : '' -LRB- 3 -RRB- An application for a certificate under this section - -LRB- a -RRB- shall state whether or not there are , in the applicant 's opinion , any classes of development which , either immediately or at a future time , would be appropriate for the land in question if it were not proposed to be acquired by any authority possessing compulsory purchase powers and , if so , shall specify the classes of development and the times at which they would be so appropriate ; -LRB- b -RRB- shall state the applicant 's grounds for holding that opinion ; and -LRB- c -RRB- shall be accompanied by a statement specifying the date on which a copy of the application has been or will be served on the other party directly concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
107	66	-LRB- 4 -RRB- Where an application is made to the local planning authority for a certificate under this section in respect of an interest in land , the local planning authority shall , not earlier than 21 days after the date specified in the statement mentioned in paragraph -LRB- c -RRB- of subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- of this section , issue to the applicant a certificate stating either of the following to be the opinion of the local planning authority regarding the grant of planning permission in respect of the land in question , if it were not proposed to be acquired by an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers , that is to say - -LRB- a -RRB- that planning permission would have been granted for development of one or more classes specified in the certificate -LRB- whether specified in the application or not -RRB- and for any development for which the land is to be acquired , but would not have been granted for any other development ; or -LRB- b -RRB- that planning permission would have been granted for any development for which the land is to be acquired , but would not have been granted for any other development , and for the purposes of this subsection development is development for which the land is to be acquired if the land is to be acquired for purposes which involve the carrying out of proposals of the acquiring authority for that development . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
107	67	Section 17 -LRB- 7 -RRB- provides that , in determining whether planning permission for any particular class of development would have been expected to be granted , the local planning authority shall not treat development of that class as development for which planning permission would have been refused by reason only that it would have involved development otherwise than in accordance with the development plan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
107	68	The facts It is now necessary for me to say a bit more about the facts in order to set the scene for an examination of the issue as to the assumption which the local planning authority must make when it is determining the application for a certificate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
107	69	A scheme for an improvement of the A49 to the east of Shrewsbury was originally proposed as part of the 1952 Shrewsbury Town Map . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
107	70	A protected route for an A49 by-pass was first defined across the Fletcher land and the Longmore land in November 1970 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
107	71	The effect of this , in terms of Article 9 of the Town and Country Planning General Development Order 1963 as amended , was that any planning application affecting land within 220 feet of the proposed route had to be referred to the Minister of Transport . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
107	72	Between 1963 and 1971 planning permission for residential development was refused on six occasions on various parcels of land owned by Fletcher Estates Limited because of the proposal for the by-pass . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
107	73	During the early 1970s , in response to a Department of the Environment Circular directing local authorities to release more land for housing , Shropshire County Council drew up advisory plans for the development of four areas in and around Shrewsbury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
107	74	One of these , the Sundorne Advisory Plan , was adopted by the County Council in May 1973 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
107	75	This plan included land for housing to the west of the protected route for the by-pass and to the north of it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hope
107	76	But land on the protected route and to the east of it was excluded from the proposed housing development . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
107	77	The Shropshire County Structure Plan , which was approved in February 1980 , required the urgent identification of additional housing land . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
107	78	In 1984 a public inquiry was held into the scheme for the by-pass . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
107	79	Consideration was given to an alternative route identified by the objectors which lay to the east of the Fletcher land and the Longmore land . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
107	80	In 1985 it was confirmed that the A49 by-pass would be built on the alignment of the preferred route across the Fletcher land and the Longmore land which had been defined in 1970 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
107	81	In the Shrewsbury Urban Area Local Plan , which was adopted in June 1985 , the preferred route for the A49 by-pass across the Fletcher land and the Longmore land was protected and it was thus shown as not available for any other development . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
107	82	The Plan allocated a large area of land for development for housing at The Moveage in the urban area of Shrewsbury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
107	83	From this brief history it can be seen that the scheme for the A49 by-pass can be traced back to 1952 , when the improvement scheme was first included in the Shrewsbury Town Map . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
107	84	By 1970 the route for the by-pass had been clearly identified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
107	85	From that date onwards until the date when the notice of the making of the proposed compulsory purchase orders was published this had the effect that the Fletcher land and the Longmore land was excluded from consideration as land for residential and other development . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
107	86	This was on the ground that they lay on the route of the proposed by-pass . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
107	87	The larger areas of land to the east in the same ownership were also excluded from development . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
107	88	Other land was identified as suitable for development to meet the need for more land for housing in the area . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
107	89	The Inspector concluded , after considering the evidence led at the public inquiry under section 18 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Act of 1961 , that there was no reasonable basis for considering residential development as appropriate on any part of the Fletcher land or residential and industrial development as appropriate on any part of the Longmore land as at 30 January 1986 , which was the date of the publication of the notice of the proposed compulsory purchase orders , if it was to be assumed that the by-pass would have been built on the alternative route to the east which was considered and rejected at the 1984 inquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
107	90	The Secretary of State for the Environment , acting on the same assumption , accepted the Inspector 's conclusions on this point when he decided to cancel the certificates issued by the local planning authority and to replace them with negative certificates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
107	91	The issue in this appeal It is now possible to identify more precisely the issue which divided the parties to this appeal , bearing in mind that they were agreed that the relevant date for determining the content of the certificates of alternative development is the date of publication of the notices of the proposed compulsory purchase orders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
107	92	The issue relates to the meaning and effect of the direction in section 17 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the Act of 1961 that the local planning authority must issue its opinion regarding the grant of planning permission in respect of the land in question `` if it were not proposed to be acquired by an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
107	93	It is plain that the assumption which the local planning authority is directed to make by this subsection requires it to ignore the fact that an interest in the land is proposed to be acquired by an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers as described in section 22 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
107	94	This involves disregarding the publication of the notice of the proposed compulsory purchase order , which is the circumstance referred to in section 22 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- that is relevant to this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
107	95	The question is - how much else must the local planning authority disregard when making its assumption ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
107	96	Mr. Ouseley Q.C. for the Secretary of State accepted that the assumption extended to the proposal that the land was to be acquired by an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers for the purposes of the A49 by-pass as it stood at the relevant date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hope
107	97	As at that date the route for the proposed by-pass was shown as a protected route on the Shrewsbury Urban Area Local Plan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
107	98	He accepted that it would not be possible to make sense of section 17 -LRB- 4 -RRB- if that proposal could be taken into account by the local planning authority when it was considering the content of the certificate , as this was the same proposal as that which had led to publication of the notices that the land was to be acquired compulsorily . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
107	99	He accepted that , if the planning status of the land was to be considered on the basis that it was to be assumed that the land was not proposed to be acquired compulsorily on the relevant date , the proposal underlying that acquisition as it stood at the relevant date must also be disregarded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
107	100	So , when the assumption was made that the section 22 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- notices had been cancelled , the underlying proposal which led to the publication of those notices must also be assumed to have been cancelled as at the relevant date Mr. Purchas Q.C. for the landowners submitted that the statutory assumption required the local planning authority to disregard not only the underlying proposal as it stood at the relevant date but also all the effects of that proposal which had arisen before that date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
107	101	According to his argument it was necessary , in order to give effect to the statutory assumption , to eliminate all the consequences of the safeguarding of the proposed route for the by-pass from the date when the proposal first began to affect the planning history of the land which was proposed to be acquired . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
107	102	If one was able to look back and to remove the consequences of the designation of the route for the by-pass as a protected route , other land in the immediate area of the Fletcher land and the Longmore land would have been released for housing development prior to the relevant date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
107	103	This would have enabled the view to be taken on the relevant date that planning permission for the development of these parcels of land also would have been granted if the land was not proposed to be acquired compulsorily . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
107	104	In short , the local planning authority must disregard the effects and incidents of the proposal as a whole , irrespective of whether they occurred on , before or after the relevant date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
107	105	The policies and facts should be assumed to be those which would have been applicable if the scheme for the proposed by-pass had never been conceived in the first place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
107	106	Mr. Purchas submitted that his approach was supported by the reasons which Lord Bridge gave for the decision in Grampian Regional Council v. Secretary of State for Scotland -LSB- 1993 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 1340 , 1345A-1346C . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
107	107	He accepted that the argument which was rejected in that case was a narrower argument than that for the Secretary of State in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
107	108	But he said that the essential reasoning which was expressed in Lord Bridge 's judgment as to the purpose for which section 17 -LRB- 4 -RRB- had been enacted supported his argument that it was not just the proposed acquisition that had to be disregarded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
107	109	It was necessary to consider as a whole what would have happened if the land had not been proposed to be acquired at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
107	110	The decision in Grampian In my opinion it is clear , from an examination of the facts and the arguments in the Grampian case , that their Lordships were concerned in that case with a different issue from that which has been argued in this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
107	111	It is not just that the argument which Mr. Ouseley advanced for the Secretary of State in the present case is not the same as that which was advanced for the Regional Council in Grampian . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
107	112	The argument which Mr. Purchas advanced for the landowners is also different , as he sought to widen the scope of the statutory assumption to include matters which did not arise on the facts which were before the House in Grampian . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
107	113	The Grampian case concerned an area at Westhill , near Aberdeen , for which planning permission in principle was given in 1972 for the building of a new town . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
107	114	It was envisaged that the new town proposals would require the provision of a secondary school and at least two primary schools in the Westhill area . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
107	115	The development proceeded , and in due course a secondary school and one primary school were built on sites which had belonged to the developer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
107	116	The Regional Council , which had power to acquire these sites compulsorily as education authority , offered to purchase the two sites from the developer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
107	117	The developer applied to the local planning authority for certificates of alternative development so that compensation for the acquisition could be assessed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
107	118	The local planning authority issued negative certificates on the basis that , if there had been no proposal to acquire the land , they would nevertheless have granted planning permission only for the erection of the two schools . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hope
107	119	The developer appealed to the Secretary of State for Scotland , who issued positive certificates on the basis that , if he had to disregard the proposal to acquire , he must also disregard the fact that the two sites had been allocated by the developer for the erection of the two schools in the plans which had accompanied the plans in their application for outline planning permission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
107	120	Counsel presented the same arguments in the Court of Session when the Regional Council appealed against the Secretary of State 's decision to issue positive certificates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
107	121	They were summarised in these words by Lord Dunpark 1984 S.C. 1 , 13 , -LRB- 1983 -RRB- 47 P. & C.R. 540 , 552 : `` Counsel for all parties agreed that the grantor of the certificate must disregard the proposal to acquire . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
107	122	The issue between the appellants and the respondents is whether or not the purpose or reasons for the acquisition must also be disregarded for certificate purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
107	123	On the one hand , it is said that it is nonsense to grant a certificate for development for which the grantor knows planning permission would not be granted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
107	124	On the other hand , it is said that , as this is a hypothetical , not a practical , exercise , if one has to disregard the proposal to acquire , one must also disregard the purpose of the acquisition . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
107	125	Having considered these arguments Lord Dunpark observed , at p. 553 , in a passage which was quoted with approval by Lord Bridge -LSB- 1983 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 1340 , 1345C-D : `` It seems to me to follow from the fact that the value of the land is not to be affected by the prospect of compulsory acquisition that its value is not to be affected by the development proposed by the acquiring authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
107	126	One can not discount the one without the other . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
107	127	In the House of Lords the argument for the Regional Council , as noted by Lord Bridge , at p. 1344H , was unchanged : `` Whilst -LSB- the -RSB- offers must be ignored , so runs the argument , the underlying requirement to devote these sites to fulfil the needs of public education remains and affords a complete answer to the claims for positive certificates . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
107	128	It was in response to this argument , which he rejected , that Lord Bridge said , at p. 1345F-G : `` The primary purpose of this provision , in my view , is to obviate the possibility that where , as in the usual case , urban land is allocated in the development plan for a necessary public purpose for which it will in due course need to be acquired , that provision of the plan can be relied on to deny the landowner a positive certificate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
107	129	If the planning need to use land for a public purpose , which underlies a proposed compulsory acquisition , is not a sufficient ground to withhold a positive certificate where that need is recognised and provided for in the development plan , I do not see how the underlying planning need can ever be such a sufficient ground . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
107	130	No question was raised in the Grampian case about the wider effects of the proposal , which is the point to which Mr. Purchas 's argument was directed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
107	131	This is because , on the facts of that case , the issue about wider effects did not arise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
107	132	It was not disputed that , if the underlying requirement for schools to be built on the sites were to be disregarded , the way was clear for the granting of positive certificates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
107	133	The facts were simple . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
107	134	The sites would have formed part of the housing development in the surrounding area had they not been set aside for the schools . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
107	135	No changes had taken place prior to the relevant date which would have justified the issuing of negative certificates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
107	136	Mr. Ouseley made it clear that his argument was a different one from that which had been presented for the Regional Council in Grampian . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
107	137	As he pointed out , his argument was entirely consistent with the decision in that case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
107	138	He accepted that section 17 -LRB- 4 -RRB- required the local planning authority to disregard not only the notice of the making of the compulsory purchase order but also the purpose which underlay the need for the land to be acquired for public purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
107	139	The key issue in the present case to which he directed his argument was as to the wider effects of the assumption directed by section 17 -LRB- 4 -RRB- on the facts of this case , which did not arise for consideration in Grampian . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hope
107	140	Section 17 -LRB- 4 -RRB- It is necessary in these circumstances to examine the wording of section 17 -LRB- 4 -RRB- more closely in order to see whether the assumption which it directs can accommodate the wider effects for which Mr Purchas contended on behalf of the landowners . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
107	141	The critical words in the subsection to which attention must be directed are to be found in the phrase `` if it were not proposed to be acquired . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
107	142	Those words must be examined in the light of the agreed fact that the relevant date , as at which the local planning authority is required by the subsection to issue its opinion regarding the grant of planning permission , is the date of the section 22 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- notice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
107	143	The language is , as Buxton L.J. observed -LSB- 1999 -RSB- Q.B. 1144 , 1155F , not of the past but of the present conditional . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
107	144	The assumption which has to be made is that the land is not `` proposed to be acquired '' at the relevant date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
107	145	The words `` proposed to be acquired '' are given a particular meaning by the statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
107	146	They appear in section 17 -LRB- 1 -RRB- which identifies the time when the parties may apply for a certificate of alternative development , and they appear again in section 17 -LRB- 3 -RRB- which describes the contents of the application for a certificate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
107	147	The circumstances in which an interest in land shall be taken to be an interest proposed to be acquired are defined in section 22 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
107	148	It is by reference to the circumstances defined in section 22 -LRB- 2 -RRB- that the relevant date for the determination of the issue about planning permission is identified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
107	149	The effect of that subsection is that an interest in land can not be taken to be an interest proposed to be acquired for the purposes of section 17 until one or other of the circumstances which it describes has occurred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
107	150	The position appears therefore to be quite straightforward upon a consideration of the ordinary meaning of the words used in the statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
107	151	The assumption which the local planning authority must make relates to the situation as at the relevant date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
107	152	The scheme for which the land is proposed to be acquired , together with the underlying proposal which may appear in any of the planning documents , must be assumed on that date to have been cancelled . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
107	153	No assumption has to be made as to may or may not have happened in the past . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
107	154	Wider considerations This conclusion as to the meaning of the words used in section 17 -LRB- 4 -RRB- is consistent with the nature of the exercise which the local planning authority is required to perform . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
107	155	The system of planning control which requires planning permission to be obtained for the development of land brings into account a variety of facts and circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
107	156	Factors such as predictions of population growth and the availability of suitable land for development affect the need for more land to be released for housing in the area . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
107	157	These factors need to be re-assessed at regular intervals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
107	158	A need which was identified ten or five years ago may have disappeared . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
107	159	The predicted growth on which it was based may have been reduced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
107	160	The need may have been fully met by the building of the required number of houses in the given area . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
107	161	Or other factors may have changed , leading to the conclusion that the need must be met elsewhere . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hope
107	162	It is one thing to examine these factors , on the assumption that the proposal has been cancelled on the relevant date , in the light of existing circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
107	163	It is quite another to look back into the past and to try to reconstruct the planning history of the area on the assumption that the proposal had never come into existence at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
107	164	The further back in time one goes , the more likely it is that one assumption as to what would have happened must follow on another and the more difficult it is likely to be to reach a conclusion in which anybody can have confidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
107	165	In Jelson v. Minister of Housing and Local Government -LSB- 1970 -RSB- 1 Q.B. 243 , where a proposed ring road had been cancelled owing to the construction of a motorway , the landowners applied for certificates of appropriate alternative development . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
107	166	The Minister confirmed the negative certificates which had been issued by the local planning authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
107	167	It was contended that the question whether planning permission might reasonably have been expected to be granted should be considered not as at the date of the section 22 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- notice but as at a date before there had been any proposal for the strip of land to be used for a ring road . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
107	168	The landowners ' appeals were dismissed on the ground that the local planning authority must determine the question of planning permission as at the date of the notice , in the circumstances then existing , and not by looking at events in the past . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
107	169	Lord Denning M.R. and Sachs L.J. saw the question as one of construction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
107	170	They reached their conclusion by examining the meaning of the words used in section 17 -LRB- 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
107	171	But Phillimore L.J. added these observations , at p. 255C : `` An important factor is that , apart from the question of construction , once you start looking back , the whole exercise becomes hopelessly uncertain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
107	172	Did it all result from the designation of this strip as required for the ring road ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
107	173	How far was the state of the land due to the appellants ' own action in building right up to the strip ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
107	174	Could they have avoided loss by serving notice to purchase in 1959 when the provisions of the Act of 1961 were first -LSB- enacted -RSB- ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
107	175	Have they really suffered any loss , or did they pay for the strip on the basis that it was blighted land ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
107	176	At any rate , when they acquired it they knew this to be the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
107	177	It seems to me that to look back beyond the date of the deemed notice to treat would open up a considerable filed of guesswork which would often make it impossible to give firm advice to any member of the public as to his rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
107	178	Accordingly , both as a matter of construction and on wider grounds , I would dismiss these appeals . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
107	179	Some of Phillimore L.J. 's observations in that passage relate to issues which are for consideration by the Lands Tribunal and not by the local planning authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
107	180	None of his questions as to the actions of the landowners have been raised in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
107	181	But there is much force in his point that once one starts looking back in time the exercise becomes clouded in uncertainty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
107	182	The questions which are likely to arise will be complex and difficult . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hope
107	183	They will involve matters of evidence as to past events , the assessment of which is likely to lie outside the expertise of the local planning authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
107	184	Its normal function is to examine planning issues in the light of existing circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
107	185	The fact that applications for certificates of appropriate alternative development are made to the local planning authority lies at the heart of the matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
107	186	It supports the view that the determination as to the contents of the certificate should be arrived at by applying ordinary planning principles to the existing circumstances , not by assessing what may or may not have happened in the past . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
107	187	The question which the local planning authority , and in his turn the Secretary of State for the Environment , had to answer in this case was therefore a relatively simple one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
107	188	It was capable of being determined , on the assumption that the proposal had been cancelled on the relevant date , in the light of the circumstances existing at that date and by the application of ordinary planning principles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
107	189	The question was whether reasons existed for the refusal of planning permission which were quite independent of any scheme for the acquisition of the land for use for the purposes of the proposed by-pass : see per Lord Bridge in Grampian Regional Council v. Secretary of State for Scotland at p. 1346F . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
107	190	Lord Bridge said in Grampian at p. 1345G-H , that the overriding consideration which impelled him to reject the argument for the appellants in that case was that it would , if accepted , defeat the essential purpose of the procedure for obtaining certificates of appropriate alternative development as part of the overall scheme of the Act which was to secure the payment of fair compensation to landowners who were being compulsorily expropriated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
107	191	The flaw which he observed in the appellants ' argument was that to allow reliance on the underlying public requirement to determine the question would lead to the issue of a negative certificate in every case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
107	192	This purposive approach to the words used in section 17 -LRB- 4 -RRB- led inevitably to a rejection of the argument advanced by the acquiring authority that , while the acquisition itself must be discounted , the underlying proposal should not be . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
107	193	The position which Mr. Ouseley has adopted in the present case removes that difficulty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
107	194	The assumption , which he accepts , that the underlying proposal must be taken to have been cancelled on the relevant date , as well as the section 22 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- notice which gave effect to it , meets the objection that the cancellation approach will always lead to the issue of a negative certificate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
107	195	On his approach , the scheme for the payment of fair compensation can be put into effect in a way which will reflect the development value of the land at the relevant date independently of any scheme for the proposed by-pass . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
107	196	I can find nothing in the overall scheme of the Act which requires the question whether planning permission would have been granted for any classes of alternative development to be determined by reference to events which may or may not have happened in the past if the proposal had not come into existence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
107	197	It may be , as Mr. Ouseley suggested , that these wider issues can be raised under section 9 of the Act when the amount of the compensation which is to be paid for land which is to be taken compulsorily is being assessed by the Lands Tribunal : see Jelson Ltd. v. Blaby District Council -LSB- 1977 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 1020 , in which Jelsons were held to be entitled to the full economic value of the land which had been taken from them disregarding the effects of the scheme under section 9 of the Act of 1961 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
107	198	But that is not a matter which your Lordships need to resolve in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
107	199	I would hold that these wider issues are not relevant to the determination which the local planning authority must make as to the contents of a certificate of appropriate alternative development . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hope
