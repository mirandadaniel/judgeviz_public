242	22	LORD HUTTON 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
242	23	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
242	24	The two appeals before your Lordships relate to the procedures to be followed by the police pursuant to section 7 -LRB- 3 -RRB- or section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Road Traffic Act 1988 where a specimen of blood or urine is to be provided by a driver suspected of driving under the influence of drink or drugs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
242	25	It is clearly desirable that as far as possible the law governing this procedure should be simple and free from complexity but regrettably questions arising under these sections have given rise to many appeals to the Divisional Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
242	26	Before turning to the facts of the two cases it will be convenient to set out the relevant sections of the Act which provide : `` 7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
242	27	-LRB- 1 -RRB- In the course of an investigation into whether a person has committed an offence under section 3A , 4 or 5 of this Act a constable may , subject to the following provisions of this section and section 9 of this Act , require him -- -LRB- a -RRB- to provide two specimens of breath for analysis by means of a device of a type approved by the Secretary of State , or -LRB- b -RRB- to provide a specimen of blood or urine for a laboratory test . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
242	28	-LRB- 2 -RRB- A requirement under this section to provide specimens of breath can only be made at a police station . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
242	29	-LRB- 3 -RRB- A requirement under this section to provide a specimen of blood or urine can only be made at a police station or at a hospital ; and it can not be made at a police station unless -- -LRB- a -RRB- the constable making the requirement has reasonable cause to believe that for medical reasons a specimen of breath can not be provided or should not be required , or -LRB- b -RRB- at the time the requirement is made a device or a reliable device of the type mentioned in subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- above is not available at the police station or it is then for any other reason not practicable to use such a device there , or -LRB- c -RRB- the suspected offence is one under -LSB- section 3A or 4 -RSB- of this Act and the constable making the requirement has been advised by a medical practitioner that the condition of the person required to provide the specimen might be due to some drug ; but may then be made notwithstanding that the person required to provide the specimen has already provided or been required to provide two specimens of breath . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
242	30	-LRB- 4 -RRB- If the provision of a specimen other than a specimen of breath may be required in pursuance of this section the question whether it is to be a specimen of blood or a specimen of urine shall be decided by the constable making the requirement , but if a medical practitioner is of the opinion that for medical reasons a specimen of blood can not or should not be taken the specimen shall be a specimen of urine . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
242	31	-LRB- 6 -RRB- A person who , without reasonable excuse , fails to provide a specimen when required to do so in pursuance of this section is guilty of an offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
242	32	-LRB- 7 -RRB- A constable must , on requiring any person to provide a specimen in pursuance of this section , warn him that a failure to provide it may render him liable to prosecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
242	33	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
242	34	-LRB- 1 -RRB- Subject to subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- below , of any two specimens of breath provided by any person in pursuance of section 7 of this Act that with the lower proportion of alcohol in the breath shall be used and the other shall be disregarded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
242	35	-LRB- 2 -RRB- If the specimen with the lower proportion of alcohol contains no more than 50 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath , the person who provided it may claim that it should be replaced by such specimen as may be required under section 7 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of this Act and , if he then provides such a specimen , neither specimen of breath shall be used . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
242	36	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
242	37	-LRB- 4 -RRB- A person provides a specimen of blood if and only if he consents to its being taken by a medical practitioner and it is so taken . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
242	38	The case of Jackson At 11.50 p.m. on the night of 17 August 1995 police officers in Widnes , in Cheshire , saw the defendant , Stephen Jackson , driving a motor car on a public road in an erratic manner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
242	39	They stopped him and one of the officers saw that his eyes were red and glazed and noticed that his speech was slurred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hutton
242	40	The officer arrested the defendant on suspicion of having driven whilst unfit to do so through drink or drugs and brought him to the police station , where the facts of his arrest were outlined to the police sergeant in the station . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	41	In the police station the defendant was examined by a doctor who then informed the sergeant that the defendant 's symptoms could be consistent with him having taken drugs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	42	The case stated to the Divisional Court described what transpired after the doctor had told the sergeant that the defendant 's symptoms could be consistent with him having taken drugs : `` Sergeant Dickson then requested the Appellant to provide a sample of blood or urine and warned him that failure to provide a sample may make him liable for prosecution , the Appellant replied ` No . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	43	Sergeant Dickson warned him again about failure to provide and asked if he had any representations whether the sample should be blood or urine , the Appellant replied ` No , I 'm not giving a sample . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	44	The sergeant then said to the Appellant if he were to give a specimen was there any reason why a specimen could not be taken and told him that his only right to object to giving blood and giving urine instead would be for a medical reason to be determined by the doctor , the Appellant replied ' I do n't like needles but I 'm not giving anything anyway . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	45	Sergeant Dickson then informed the Appellant that he had failed to provide the specimens without reasonable excuse and would be charged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	46	At 3.24 a.m. P.C. Davis charged the Appellant . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	47	The defendant appeared before the Justices sitting at Widnes charged with failing without reasonable excuse to provide a specimen of blood contrary to section 7 -LRB- 6 -RRB- of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 and , as recorded in the case stated , it was submitted on his behalf : '' -LRB- a -RRB- That the prosecution had failed to comply with the necessary procedure because whilst the sergeant had asked if there were ` any reasons ' why a specimen could not be given , he had immediately negated that statement by informing the Appellant that only ` medical reasons ' would be considered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	48	-LRB- b -RRB- That the Appellant raised a potential medical reason for not providing a sample of blood when he said ' I do n't like needles , ' the sergeant should have referred this to a doctor to determine whether or not it could amount to a medical reason . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	49	The justices convicted the defendant and the case stated recorded the reasons for their decision as follows : `` We were of the opinion that the defendant understood the procedure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	50	The defendant clearly indicated that he would not give any specimen of any type before he was asked if there was any reason why he could not give a specimen of blood . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	51	We were satisfied that the sergeant had complied with the procedure laid down in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Warren . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	52	We were of the opinion that the Sergeant did not have to enquire whether there was any medical substance in the statement ' I do n't like needles ' as the defendant had within the same sentence stated for the third occasion that he would not give a sample of any type . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	53	We therefore convicted the Appellant as charged '' On the appeal of the defendant to the Divisional Court -LRB- constituted by Lord Bingham of Cornhill C.J. and Buxton J. -RRB- two arguments were advanced on his behalf . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	54	One argument was based on a passage in the judgment of Mustill L.J. in Johnson v. West Yorkshire Metropolitan Police -LSB- 1986 -RSB- R.T.R. 167-175 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	55	It was submitted that once the defendant had told the sergeant `` I do n't like needles '' he had raised a potential medical reason for not providing a specimen of blood and that the sergeant should either have referred his objection to a doctor or have asked further questions in order to ascertain whether the matter should be referred to a doctor , and that having failed to do so the defendant should not have been convicted because there had not been compliance with the full procedure required by section 7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	56	The Divisional Court rejected this submission on two grounds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	57	The first ground was that the statement `` I do n't like needles '' was not a sufficient statement , whether actually or potentially , of a valid medical objection to place the police officer under the obligation to refer the matter to a doctor or to ask further questions to ascertain whether the matter should be so referred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	58	The second ground was that on the facts of the case the defendant had made it entirely clear , before the sergeant asked him if there was any reason why a specimen of blood should not be taken , that he was not going to give a specimen of either blood or urine , and he reiterated this attitude when he expressed his dislike of needles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	59	The second argument advanced on behalf of the defendant to the Divisional Court relied on the judgment of Lord Bridge of Harwich in this House in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Warren -LSB- 1993 -RSB- A.C. 319 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	60	It will be necessary to consider Lord Bridge 's speech in greater detail later in this judgment , but at this stage it is sufficient to cite two passages from the speech upon which the defendants relied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	61	Lord Bridge set out the words addressed by the police officer in that case to the defendant , at p. 324 : `` The approved evidential breath testing device can not be used on this occasion because the calibration check has proved unsatisfactory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	62	Accordingly , I require you to provide an alternative specimen , which will be submitted for laboratory analysis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	63	The specimen may be of blood or urine but it is for me to decide which . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	64	If you provide a specimen you will be offered part of it in a suitable container . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	65	If you fail to provide a specimen you may be liable to prosecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hutton
242	66	Are there any reasons why a specimen of blood can not or should not be taken by a doctor ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	67	And Lord Bridge stated , at p. 332 `` in a case where the necessity to require a specimen of blood or urine under section 7 -LRB- 4 -RRB- arises for one of the reasons specified in section 7 -LRB- 3 -RRB- , what is required is no more and no less than the formula used in the instant case or words to like effect . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	68	Lord Bridge made it clear in his speech , at p. 328B , that the reference in the formula to `` any reasons '' included a non-medical reason as well as a medical reason . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	69	The submission made on behalf of the defendant Jackson was that the requirement laid down by Lord Bridge had not been complied with because , although the sergeant had asked the defendant was there any reason why a specimen could not be taken , he immediately negated this question by telling him that his only right to object to giving blood would be for a medical reason to be determined by the doctor : in other words the sergeant did not ask the defendant if there were any reasons other than medical reasons why a specimen of blood could not be taken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	70	This submission was accepted by the Divisional Court with reluctance and only because the court felt itself bound by the authority of Warren 's case to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	71	The appeal was therefore allowed and in delivering the judgment of the court Buxton J. stated : `` If what is required , to cite Lord Bridge 's ruling , is that the Warren formula must be used and must not be added to or subtracted from , then we are reluctantly forced to conclude that a rider to that formula that can plausibly be read as indicating that the only reasons that the driver is being invited to state are medical ones does indeed provide less than Warren 's case -LSB- 1993 -RSB- A.C. 319 requires . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	72	We therefore feel forced to follow the authority of the House of Lords in Warren 's case rather than that of this court in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Donnelly -LSB- 1998 -RSB- R.T.R. 188 and allow this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	73	Further considerations We have reached our conclusion in this case with the greatest concern , not least because of what appears to be the widespread and , absent authority , perfectly reasonable use of the formula used in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	74	We hope that the issue in this case , and the wider questions involved in the breathalyser law , will be the subject of early reconsideration by the House of Lords . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	75	To that end we are minded to certify a question for their Lordships House and to grant leave . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	76	The question certified by the Divisional Court as the point of law of general public importance is as follows : `` To what extent if at all should the guidance given by the House in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Warren as to the procedure to be followed when a request is made for a sample of blood under the provisions of section 7 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the Road Traffic Act 1988 be applied beyond the issue arising in that case of whether the driver should be invited to express a preference for giving blood or urine ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	77	If that guidance does not apply other than in respect of that issue what on the true construction of the Road Traffic Act 1988 is the procedure to be followed when a request is made under sections 7 -LRB- 3 -RRB- 7 -LRB- 4 -RRB- and 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of that Act ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	78	The case of Stanley About midnight on 8 May 1996 police officers in Denham , in Buckinghamshire , stopped the defendant in a motor car which he was driving . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	79	The defendant was arrested and brought to Amersham Police Station . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	80	At the police station he agreed to provide two specimens of breath for analysis by an intoximeter machine . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	81	The specimen with a lower proportion of alcohol contained 47 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath , and therefore the defendant was entitled to the option given by section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Road Traffic Act 1988 to claim that the specimen should be replaced by a specimen of blood or urine as may be required under section 7 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	82	The police officer who was dealing with the defendant had with him his own pro-forma booklet which set out the questions which he was required by his police force to ask . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	83	Accordingly he asked the following question of the defendant : `` As the breath specimen with the lower proportion of alcohol exceeds the statutory limit , but contains no more than 50 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath you may claim that it should be replaced by a specimen for a laboratory test . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	84	Such a specimen can be of blood or urine . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	85	If you wish , part of the specimen will be provided to you for independent analysis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	86	The decision as to which type of specimen is to be provided is that of the police . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	87	If you elect to supply such a specimen , it will normally be of blood which will be taken by a medical practitioner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	88	I should tell you that your only right to object to giving blood and to give urine instead will be for medical reasons to be determined by a medical practitioner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	89	The result of the laboratory test will replace the result of the specimen of breath already provided by you . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	90	Do you wish to replace the breath specimen with a specimen of blood or urine ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	91	The defendant replied : `` No , I do n't want no needle . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hutton
242	92	The case stated then said : `` Police Sergeant Wharton thought that that reply constituted a refusal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	93	In cross examination the police sergeant accepted that he did not ask why the appellant refused and neither did the appellant say why he had refused . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	94	The police sergeant accepted that both through forgetfulness and because he believed that the appellant had refused , he did not ask the ` medical reasons ' question . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	95	After the question which was put to the defendant by the police officer set out above the pro-forma booklet set out as a further question `` Are there any medical reasons why a sample of blood can not or should not be taken by a doctor ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	96	The defendant appeared before the Wycombe & Beaconsfield Magistrates ' Court charged with driving a motor vehicle on a road after consuming so much alcohol that the proportion of it in his breath exceeded the prescribed limit contrary to section 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	97	After a hearing the defendant was convicted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	98	The defendant appealed to the Crown Court at Aylesbury which heard and dismissed the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	99	In the case stated by the Crown Court the following reasons were given for the dismissal of the appeal : '' -LRB- g -RRB- Having heard all the evidence we found that it was a refusal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	100	In giving the judgment of the court I stated that we so found . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	101	-LRB- h -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	102	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	103	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	104	We found that there was no medical issue in the Appellant 's case and no usurpation by the police sergeant of the medical practitioner 's function . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	105	I said so in giving judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	106	To the question posed : ` Could the reply have amounted to a medical reason ? ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	107	we were satisfied to the extent that we were sure that the answer was ` No . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	108	-LRB- i -RRB- The second ground of appeal was based upon ` inadequate performance ' in that the police sergeant forgot to ask the medical question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	109	We were referred to Anderton v. Lythgoe -LSB- 1985 -RSB- 1 W.L.R. 222 and Edge v. Director of Public Prosecutions -LSB- 1993 -RSB- R.T.R. 146 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	110	-LRB- j -RRB- We asked ourselves whether the law required a police officer in the face of a refusal to continue and ask a raft of irrelevant questions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	111	We were of the opinion that it did not -LRB- l -RRB- Finally under this head we asked ourselves whether the law required a police officer to ask anyway . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	112	We were satisfied that there was no such legal requirement . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	113	The argument advanced on behalf of the defendant Stanley to the Divisional Court -LRB- constituted by Brook L.J. and Blofeld J. -RRB- was the same as the first argument advanced to the Divisional Court on behalf of the defendant Jackson in reliance on the judgment of Mustill L.J. in Johnson 's case -LSB- 1986 -RSB- R.T.R. 167 , namely that the defendant Stanley 's reply to the police officer `` No , I do n't want no needle '' indicated that there may have been a medical issue which required the police officer to ask the follow-up question `` Are there any medical reasons why a sample of blood can not or should not be taken by a doctor ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	114	so that the procedure required by section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and section 7 -LRB- 4 -RRB- had not been properly carried out with the consequence that the prosecution had not been entitled to rely on the result of the breath test as the defendant had been denied the full benefit of the choice given to him by section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	115	The Divisional Court rejected this submission and Blofeld J. stated : `` Looking at this case we can perfectly well see that that answer was capable , depending no doubt on the background and depending on its intonation possibly , of raising a medical question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	116	But in my view it was open to the court that heard that evidence to come to the firm conclusion , as this court did come , that it did not amount to a medical reason . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	117	Consequently , for my part , I would reject the submission that the decision by the learned Crown Court judge and his colleagues was Wednesbury unreasonable . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hutton
242	118	There was a second point raised before the Divisional Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	119	It was described as follows by Blofeld J. : `` There is a second point in this appeal , which Mr. McGuire recognises has now been overtaken by the decision in this court in Fraser v . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	120	The Director of Public Prosecutions -LRB- unreported -RRB- , 29 January 1997 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	121	Prior to that decision an argument could have been mounted that it was required for the police officer before asking the appellant to give any reply to his lengthy question also to make clear to him that he could refuse to give a sample of blood for medical reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	122	As it happens , that situation never in fact arose here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	123	The police officer concerned came to the conclusion that the reply was an unequivocal refusal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	124	That decision was upheld by the judge and his colleagues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	125	Consequently there was no need to ask any further questions . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	126	In the lengthy question which the police officer put to the defendant he did say : `` I should tell you that your only right to object to giving blood and to give urine instead will be for medical reasons to be determined by a medical practitioner . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	127	Therefore when Blofeld J. said that prior to the decision in Fraser v. Director of Public Prosecutions -LSB- 1997 -RSB- R.T.R. 373 an argument could have been mounted `` that it was required for the police officer to make clear to him that he could refuse to give a sample of blood for medical reasons , '' I think this argument would have been that the police officer must by an express question ask the driver whether there are any medical reasons for refusing to give a specimen of blood , and I think this is confirmed by the wording of the point of law certified by the Divisional Court which was as follows : `` When a motorist who is entitled to make a claim under s. 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Road Traffic Act 1988 declines to do so , is it incumbent on a police officer to ensure that the motorist has understood his rights by asking whether there are any medical reasons for his refusal to supply an alternative specimen ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	128	The judgment in Warren 's case Before giving further consideration to the judgments of the Divisional Court in Jackson and Stanley it will be convenient to turn to the speech of Lord Bridge in Warren 's case -LSB- 1993 -RSB- A.C. 319 , with which the other members of the House agreed , because much of the argument addressed to your Lordships in the present appeals related to the effect of that speech . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	129	The issue which came before the House on that appeal was whether , when a driver was requested under section 7 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Act to provide a specimen of blood or urine , the police officer was required to ask him whether he had a preference for giving blood or urine . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	130	The House held that the Act imposed no such requirement and this was the ratio of the decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	131	But in his speech in order to give guidance as to the appropriate procedures to be followed by a police officer in a section 7 -LRB- 3 -RRB- case and a section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- case Lord Bridge stated certain requirements as to what a police officer should tell or ask the driver . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	132	Those requirements are set out in the following passages of the speech . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	133	He stated , at pp. 327-328 : `` Taking the second case first , it is clear that under section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- the driver , in order that he may decide whether or not to claim that the breath specimen be replaced , should be fully informed of the nature of the option open to him and what will be involved if he exercises it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	134	He should be told that the specimen of breath which he has given containing the lower proportion of alcohol exceeds the statutory limit but does not exceed 50 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath ; that in these circumstances he is entitled to claim to have this specimen replaced by a specimen of blood or urine if he wishes ; but that , if he does so , it will be for the constable to decide whether the replacement specimen is to be of blood or urine and that if the constable requires a specimen of blood it will be taken by a doctor unless the doctor considers that there are medical reasons for not taking blood , when urine may be given instead . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	135	I can see no ground whatever , on the face of the statute , why in a section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- case the driver should be invited to state whether he prefers to give blood or urine or to state any reasons for his preference . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	136	Indeed , to invite him to do so , it seems to me , can only be misleading in suggesting that the driver is entitled to some say in the matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	137	The statute gives him no such say . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	138	The driver is faced with the prospect of conviction on the basis of the breath specimen which he has given containing the lower proportion of alcohol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	139	His only chance of escape from that prospect is by opting to give and then in fact giving a replacement specimen of whichever kind the constable requires of him , subject only to his right to object to giving blood on medical grounds , and , if they are accepted by the doctor , then to give urine instead . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	140	Again , so far as the language of the statute is concerned , I can see no reason in principle why the constable in the course of explaining to the driver his rights under section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- should not tell him , if it be the case , that he , the constable , will require the replacement specimen to be of blood . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	141	`` In a case where the reason for requiring a specimen of blood or urine arises under section 7 -LRB- 3 -RRB- , there is no question of the driver having any option to exercise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	142	Hence , whatever necessity there may be to explain the position to him , the reasons why it is necessary to give such an explanation can not be the same as those which arise under section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	143	Again , on the face of the statute , I can not see any reason why in this case the constable should do more than tell the driver the reason under section 7 -LRB- 3 -RRB- why breath specimens can not be taken or used ; tell him that in these circumstances he is required to give a specimen of blood or urine but that it is for the constable to decide which ; warn him that a failure to provide the specimen required may render him liable to prosecution ; and then , if the constable decides to require blood , ask the driver if there are any reasons why a specimen can not or should not be taken from him by a doctor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hutton
242	144	This will certainly give the driver the opportunity to raise any objection he may have to giving blood , either on medical grounds or indeed for any other reason which might afford a ` reasonable excuse ' under section 7 -LRB- 6 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	145	Here again , provided the driver has such an opportunity , I can see nothing in the language of the statute which would justify a procedural requirement that the driver be invited to express his own preference for giving blood or urine , either before a constable indicates which specimen he will require or at all . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	146	And he stated , at p. 332 : `` At the end of this necessarily lengthy examination of the decided cases I have found nothing which causes me to depart from the view I expressed before embarking on that examination as to the appropriate procedure to be followed under section 7 -LRB- 3 -RRB- and section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- considered simply on the basis of the statutory language . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	147	Restating those views in summary form , in a case where the necessity to require a specimen of blood or urine under section 7 -LRB- 4 -RRB- arises for one of the reasons specified in section 7 -LRB- 3 -RRB- , what is required is no more and no less than the formula used in the instant case or words to the like effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	148	In a case where the driver 's option is to be explained to him under section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , the driver should be told that if he exercises the right to have a replacement specimen taken under section 7 -LRB- 4 -RRB- , it will be for the constable to decide whether that specimen is to be of blood or urine and , if the constable intends to require a specimen of blood to be taken by a medical practitioner , the driver should be told that his only right to object to giving blood and to give urine instead will be for medical reasons to be determined by the medical practitioner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	149	In neither case is there any need to invite the driver to express his preference for giving blood or urine . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	150	As Lord Bingham of Cornhill C.J. observed in Fraser v. Director of Public Prosecutions -LSB- 1997 -RSB- R.T.R. 373 , 380F it had been hoped that the judgment in Warren 's case would settle the law on the vexed topic of the procedures to be followed by the police , but unfortunately this has not been achieved and there has been a continuing stream of cases coming before the Divisional Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	151	In these circumstances I understand your Lordships to be agreed that this House should give further thought to the judgment in Warren 's case to consider whether additional guidance could be given to assist the courts which have to apply section 7 -LRB- 3 -RRB- and section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	lord hutton	all	partagr	0.6	lord hutton
242	152	The principal difficulty which has arisen following the judgment in Warren 's case is that different approaches have been taken in two lines of cases to the question whether the requirements stated by Lord Bridge are mandatory , so that a failure to observe a requirement must lead to an acquittal , or whether a breach of a requirement is not necessarily a bar to a conviction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	153	The approach in one line of cases is exemplified by the statement of Leggatt L.J. in Reg . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	154	v. Cheshire Justices , Ex parte Cunningham -LSB- 1995 -RSB- R.T.R. 287 , 291 when referring to the decision in Warren 's case he said : `` Since that decision of the House of Lords there have been other cases in this court , in particular Edge v. Director of Public Prosecutions -LSB- 1993 -RSB- R.T.R. 146 , Meade v. Director of Public Prosecutions -LSB- 1993 -RSB- R.T.R. 151 , and the more recent case of Ogburn v. Director of Public Prosecutions -LSB- 1994 -RSB- R.T.R. 241 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	155	Those subsequent cases have refuted attempts by the prosecution to blur the requirements enunciated by Lord Bridge , and to insist that the requirements which he stipulated were to be strictly complied with . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	156	There has been a suggestion made in one of the subsequent cases that the relevant parts of his speech were not to be read as though they were part of a statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	157	That is , of course , exactly what they were , or at all events they represented such rendition of the statute as the House of Lords thought appropriate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	158	Accordingly , those requirements are to be strictly complied with . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	159	The approach in the other line of cases is exemplified by the statement of Waller J. in Hayes v. Director of Public Prosecutions -LSB- 1994 -RSB- R.T.R. 163 , 172 : `` It is important to appreciate that what Lord Bridge was saying in the passages quoted above was not by reference to the sort of facts that one has in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	160	Furthermore , they are not the words of a statute to be analysed as such . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	161	The same approach was taken by Curtis J. in Baldwin v. Director of Public Prosecutions -LSB- 1996 -RSB- R.T.R. 238 , 246 : `` I would observe that the words of Lord Bridge in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Warren -LSB- 1993 -RSB- R.T.R. 58 are not a statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	162	As I have endeavoured to set out , they are words to guide the lower courts in the interpretation of the statute and how this branch of the law should be approached . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	163	In my judgment , so long as the option given by the statute is explained fairly and properly so that the driver can make an informed decision , the requirements of justice and the efficacy of the driver 's option given by the statute under section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- are ensured . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	164	Of course , it is right , as Turner v. Director of Public Prosecutions -LRB- Note-1994 -RRB- -LSB- 1996 -RSB- R.T.R. 274 , 278L-279A requires , that the explanation of the matters that the driver has to be told in order to exercise his proper right should be detailed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	165	However , on the facts of this case , in my judgment , this particular defendant did make an informed decision and was given all the necessary explanations and information that he would need to make a proper and informed decision . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	166	In considering the issue raised by these two lines of cases it is necessary to have regard to the respective functions of the police officer and the doctor set out in the sections . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	167	Section 7 -LRB- 4 -RRB- provides that if a specimen other than a specimen of breath may be required under that section it is for the police officer to decide whether the specimen will be blood or urine . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	168	But section 11 -LRB- 4 -RRB- provides that the specimen of blood is to be taken by a doctor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	169	In addition the right of the police officer to choose whether the specimen will be of blood or urine is subject to the qualification that if a medical reason is raised why a specimen of blood can not or should not be taken , the issue is to be decided by a doctor and not by the police officer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hutton
242	170	In Johnson v. West Yorkshire Metropolitan Police -LSB- 1986 -RSB- R.T.R. 167 Mustill L.J. , stated at p. 175 -LRB- I have substituted the numbers of the similar sections in the Act of 1988 for the numbers of the sections in the Road Traffic Act 1972 , as modified by section 25 of , and Schedule 8 to , the Transport Act 1981 , which Mustill L.J. was considering -RRB- : `` The taking of a sample is a much more serious infringement of the subject 's ordinary liberties than causing him to blow into a machine , and medical questions of real significance and difficulty may arise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	171	Accordingly section -LSB- 7 -LRB- 4 -RRB- -RSB- introduced the medical practitioner as the arbiter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	172	It makes no reference to the police officer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	173	The implication is to my mind clear that in deciding the medical issue the constable has no role to play . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	174	This does not however lead to an interpretation at the opposite extreme , which would require the officer to act as no more than a messenger , obliged to turn out the medical practitioner whenever the suspect contrived to utter a form of words suggesting a claim for medical immunity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	175	The police officer can not have the power to rule upon a medical issue , but he must have the power to form a view on whether such an issue has been raised at all , for otherwise the medical practitioner would be troubled by excuses which have nothing to do with the expertise which is the reason for his being given a part to play under section -LSB- 7 -LRB- 4 -RRB- -RSB- . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	176	Moreover an offence under section 7 -LRB- 6 -RRB- for failure to provide a specimen of blood or urine or an offence under section 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , proved by a specimen of breath where the driver has not claimed under section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- to replace it with a specimen of blood or urine , is an unusual offence in that in the police station prior to the charge being made the driver has a choice to make . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	177	Where a driver is charged under section 7 -LRB- 6 -RRB- for failing to provide a specimen of blood , he will have been faced with the choice whether he will give a specimen of blood or risk a prosecution , and this choice arises in the context that if he has a medical reason for not giving a specimen of blood the validity of the reason is to be decided by a doctor and not by the police officer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	178	Mustill L.J. referred to this choice in Johnson 's case at p. 174 : `` Equally , where the question of an alternative specimen arises under section -LSB- 7 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -RSB- rather than -LSB- 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -RSB- , one would need to find specific language to produce the result that the constable , by means of a final ruling on a medical objection , could put the suspect to the choice of allowing a specimen of blood or risking prosecution under section -LSB- 7 -LRB- 6 -RRB- -RSB- without access to a practitioner . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	179	And under section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- the driver is faced with the choice whether he will claim that the specimen of breath should be replaced by such specimen as may be required under section 7 -LRB- 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	180	It is because the driver has these choices , and because a doctor has a role to play both in taking a specimen of blood and in deciding the validity of a reason advanced by the driver as to why a specimen of blood can not or should not be taken , that Lord Bridge in Warren 's case -LSB- 1993 -RSB- A.C. 319 , immediately before stating what the driver should be told , said , at p. 327 : `` it is clear that under section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- the driver , in order that he may decide whether or not to claim that the breath specimen be replaced , should be fully informed of the nature of the option open to him and what will be involved if he exercises it . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	181	It has been observed in a number of subsequent cases that the requirements stated by Lord Bridge in respect of section 7 -LRB- 3 -RRB- and -LRB- 4 -RRB- and section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- are not contained in the express words of the Act ; the only express requirement set out in the sections is the requirement in section 7 -LRB- 7 -RRB- that a police officer must warn a driver that a failure to provide a specimen may render him liable to prosecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	182	In Joiner v. Director of Public Prosecutions -LSB- 1997 -RSB- R.T.R. 387 Holland J. described the submission advanced on behalf of the defendant as follows , at p. 390 : `` Mr. Ley draws our attention to that last exchange between the police officer and the defendant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	183	He submits that that exchange was defective because it did not include words from the officer to the defendant : ` You can only object to giving blood on medical grounds . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	184	That submission is not based at all upon the Road Traffic Act 1988 which does not make any such warning mandatory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	185	What it is founded upon is the speech of Lord Bridge of Harwich in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Warren -LSB- 1993 -RSB- R.T.R. 58 . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	186	And he stated , at p. 393 : `` Turning back to the submission that has been made to us by Mr. Ley in this matter , the procedure adopted by the police officer could only , in my judgment , be faulted by reference to a specific statutory provision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	187	Mr. Ley himself accepts that there are no merits at all to support the submission that he is making in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	188	He simply invokes what he submits the law to be . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	189	In my happy judgment , the law is not as he submits it to be . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	190	It is as cited in Baldwin v. Director of Public Prosecutions -LSB- 1996 -RSB- R.T.R. 238 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	191	For that reason I would dismiss this appeal , not only on the first ground , but on the second ground . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	192	I think it is clear that it was considerations of fairness to the driver , to which he referred in the words at p. 327D set out above , which led Lord Bridge to hold that the requirements which he stated were implicit in the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	193	It is also apparent that Lord Bridge considered that in the application in practice of the provisions contained in sections 7 and 8 both the legitimate interests of drivers and the efficient working of the procedures by the police would be assisted by the statement of specific requirements to be observed by the police . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	194	However subsequent cases have shown that in this area of the law there are a number of disadvantages if formulae stated by an appellate court for use by the police , which are based on the need for fairness to the driver but which are not required by the express words of the Act , are regarded as mandatory requirements . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	195	One disadvantage is that the facts of individual cases and the exchanges between a driver and a police officer in the police station within the confines of the procedures laid down by sections 7 and 8 of the Act of 1988 can vary considerably , so that one prescribed form of words may not be appropriate in every case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hutton
242	196	Another disadvantage is that in some cases there is no unfairness and no resultant injustice if a driver is convicted notwithstanding that one of the Warren requirements has not been observed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	197	Robinson -LRB- Dena -RRB- v. Director of Public Prosecutions -LRB- Note -RRB- -LSB- 1997 -RSB- R.T.R. 403 was such a case ; there the breath specimen was in excess of the prescribed limit but did not exceed 50 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath and the defendant declined to exercise the option given by section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and was convicted by the justices , and the conviction was upheld by the crown court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	198	On appeal by case stated the defendant contended that the full Warren formula had not been put to her because she had not been told that a specimen of blood would be taken by a doctor and that any medical reason she raised for not giving a specimen of blood would be determined by a doctor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	199	However the case stated said : `` The defendant said in evidence that she had appreciated it was inherent in what Sergeant Tinsley had said to her that a doctor would be called to take any specimen of blood . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	200	She further stated that she knew of no medical reason why she should not give a specimen of blood . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	201	and it was agreed that this should be treated as a finding of fact . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	202	Therefore it was clear that the defendant had not been prejudiced and the appeal was dismissed , Pill L.J. stating , at pp. 408-409 : `` What is put depends on the circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	203	There could be circumstances in which a defendant in deciding whether to exercise his or her option under section 8 was prejudiced by the absence of the knowledge contained in the sentences of the Warren formula which were not put at the time the choice was exercised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	204	This , however , is far from being one of those cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	205	In my judgment , this is a hopeless appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	206	I would answer the question posed for this court by saying that the judges in the Crown Court were right to hold that the omission by Sergeant Tinsley to state all matters contained in the Warren formula did not prejudice the defendant , and I would dismiss the appeal . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	207	In Robinson 's case the Divisional Court followed the approach taken by Kennedy L.J. in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Charles -LRB- Note -RRB- -LSB- 1996 -RSB- R.T.R. 247 in a number of appeals heard together in section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	208	In giving judgment Kennedy L.J. stated , at p. 270 : `` it would be a question of fact for the justices to decide in any given case whether the breach -LSB- of the Warren requirements -RSB- deprived the driver of the opportunity to exercise the option , and in some cases a court might be prepared to find that it did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	209	If , to go back to an example used earlier in this judgment , a driver who declined to exercise the option were to satisfy the court that he would have exercised it if he had realised that a doctor would be called to take a specimen of blood , then it would be open to the court to conclude that a breath specimen should not be used because had the option been properly explained to the driver he would have provided a specimen of a different kind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	210	Accordingly I conclude that in each of the seven cases with which we are concerned the failure of the constable to comply in every particular with the Warren formula is immaterial because : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The driver in each case having elected not to provide a replacement specimen , the prosecution relied upon the analysis of the original specimen of breath which was untainted by the later breach of the Warren formula . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	211	-LRB- 2 -RRB- In no case is there any evidence to suggest that the constable 's failure to give the full formula deprived the driver of the opportunity to exercise the option , or caused him to exercise it in a way that he or she would not have done had everything been said . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	212	Indeed in some cases the evidence positively suggests otherwise , for example in Ruxton v. Director of Public Prosecutions -LRB- Note -- 1994 -RRB- -LSB- 1996 -RSB- R.T.R. 266J who said ` It 's four over , I 'm quite happy with that . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	213	In fact she under-quantified the excess . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	214	Although it is important to comply with the statutory provisions , as interpreted by this court and the House of Lords , it is also important to have regard to the overall intention of Parliament when this statute was enacted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	215	The relevant provisions were intended to enable a driver to provide a replacement specimen in a situation in which , as Lord Bridge has pointed out , the driver faces conviction on the basis of a specimen already provided . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	216	The provisions were not intended to provide a series of hazards for police officers which if not skilfully negotiated with complete precision would enable drivers to escape conviction entirely . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	217	In my opinion the approach taken by the Divisional Court in Robinson v. Director of Public Prosecutions -LSB- 1997 -RSB- R.T.R. 403 and Director of Public Prosecutions v. Charles -LSB- 1996 -RSB- R.T.R. 247 was correct and demonstrates that unmeritorious acquittals would take place if the Warren requirements were regarded as mandatory so that any breach of them would result in the dismissal of the charge even if the breach had caused no unfairness or prejudice to the defendant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	218	However I would respectfully differ from the view expressed by Kennedy L.J. in Charles at p. 270B as to the onus of proof and I refer to this point in a later part of this judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	219	It was submitted on behalf of the defendant Jackson that if the Warren -LSB- 1993 -RSB- A.C. 319 requirements were regarded as being guides to ensure fairness rather than as being mandatory there would be uncertainty as to the law and the administration of this branch of it would be brought into disrepute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	220	It was submitted that this result would follow because the same facts in one part of England would lead to an acquittal , while exactly the same facts would cause a conviction in another part of the country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	221	I do not accept that submission because the many decisions in the Divisional Court show how different are the precise facts which come before the justices . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hutton
242	222	Moreover it is a frequent occurrence in a criminal trial that the justices or the judge have to give a ruling on fairness in the particular circumstances of the case , and this does not cause uncertainty or bring the law into disrepute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	223	Therefore I am of opinion that the guidance given in Warren 's case should be regarded as having the following effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	224	The requirements stated by Lord Bridge , with three exceptions , are not to be treated as mandatory but as indicating the matters of which a driver should be aware so that , whether in a section 7 -LRB- 3 -RRB- case or a section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- case , he may know the role of a doctor in the taking of a specimen of blood and in determining any medical objections which he may raise to the giving of such a specimen . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	225	The requirements , constituting the three exceptions , which should be regarded as mandatory so that non-compliance should lead to an acquittal are : -LRB- 1 -RRB- in a section 7 -LRB- 3 -RRB- case the warning as to the risk of prosecution required by section 7 -LRB- 7 -RRB- ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- in a section 7 -LRB- 3 -RRB- case the statement of the reason under that subsection why breath specimens can not be taken or used ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- in a section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- case the statement that the specimen of breath which the driver has given containing the lower proportion of alcohol does not exceed 50 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	226	As well as complying with these three mandatory requirements police officers , in order to seek to ensure that a driver will be aware of the role of the doctor , should continue to use the formula in a section 7 -LRB- 3 -RRB- case and the formula in a section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- case set out by Lord Bridge -LSB- 1993 -RSB- A.C. 319 , 327-328 or words to the same effect -LRB- subject to two points to which I refer later -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	227	But what is necessary is that the driver should be aware -LRB- whether or not he is told by the police officer -RRB- of the role of the doctor so that he does not suffer prejudice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	228	Therefore if the driver appreciates that a specimen of blood will be taken by a doctor and not by a police officer , the charge should not be dismissed by the justices because the police officer failed to tell the driver that the specimen would be taken by a doctor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	229	Accordingly in relation to the Warren requirements there will be two issues for the justices to decide . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	230	The first issue is whether the matters set out in the Warren formula appropriate to a section 7 -LRB- 3 -RRB- case or a section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- case -LRB- with the respective changes to which I refer later -RRB- have been brought to the attention of the driver by the police officer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	231	The second issue , if the answer to the first issue is `` No , '' is whether in relation to the non-mandatory requirements óKó óKthe police officer 's failure to give the full formula deprived the driver of the opportunity to exercise the option , or caused him to exercise it in a way which he would not have done had everything been said . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	232	If the answer to the second issue is `` Yes '' then the driver should be acquitted , but if the answer is `` No '' the failure by the police officer to use the full formula should not be a reason for an acquittal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	233	As the second issue is directed to the question whether the driver has suffered prejudice , I consider that it would only be in exceptional cases that the justices would acquit on that ground without having heard evidence from the driver himself raising the issue that he had suffered prejudice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	234	Both issues are issues of fact , and therefore if the justices , having heard the evidence of the driver to raise the second issue , are left with a reasonable doubt as to whether or not he was prejudiced , they should acquit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	235	As I have indicated there are two respects in which I would word the requirements stated by Lord Bridge in a different way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	236	-LRB- 1 -RRB- I consider that there is nothing in the wording of the relevant subsections and there are no considerations of fairness which require a police officer to ask the driver if there are any non-medical reasons why a specimen of blood can not or should not be taken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	237	If there is some non-medical reason which would support a reasonable excuse under section 7 -LRB- 6 -RRB- this is a matter for the justices to decide . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	238	Therefore I am of opinion that in Lord Bridge 's speech -LSB- 1993 -RSB- A.C. 319 , 328 in relation to a section 7 -LRB- 3 -RRB- case the words `` ask the driver if there are any reasons why a specimen can not or should not be taken from him by a doctor '' should read `` ask the driver if there are any medical reasons why a specimen can not or should not be taken from him by a doctor . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	239	Therefore my opinion on this point accords with the sixth observation made by the Divisional Court in Jackson 's case : `` While it may well be prudent for the police officer to enquire whether there are reasons other than medical ones for a sample not being given , in order to avoid the -LRB- outside -RRB- possibility of prosecutions for refusal in which the court holds that a reasonable excuse was present under section 7 -LRB- 6 -RRB- , there is in our view nothing in the 1988 Act that justifies a requirement that the officer should make such enquiry , and every reason in commonsense to assume that if a driver has a reason for not giving a specimen that is sufficiently compelling to qualify under section 7 -LRB- 6 -RRB- he will volunteer that reason of his own motion . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	240	-LRB- 2 -RRB- I also consider that in a section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- case , in addition to telling the driver that a specimen of blood `` will be taken by a doctor unless the doctor considers that there are medical reasons for not taking blood '' , the police officer should ask the driver if there are any medical reasons why a specimen can not or should not be taken from him by a doctor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	241	I observe that the pro forma instructions of some police forces do set out this question in a section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	242	The judgements of the Divisional Court in both Jackson and Stanley referred to the decisions in Fraser v. Director of Public Prosecutions -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 373 and Director of Public Prosecutions v. Donnelly -LSB- 1998 -RSB- R.T.R. 188 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	243	In those two cases the Divisional Court considered that the argument on behalf of the respective defendants that the full Warren formula had not been followed by the police was unmeritorious and held that the failure should not lead to an acquittal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	244	The Divisional Court came to these decisions by ruling that the matters set out in the Warren formula relating to the role of the doctor need not be stated to the driver at the outset but can be stated at a later stage in the procedure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	245	I consider , with respect , that this approach is erroneous and that the driver should be told of the role of the doctor at the outset before he has to make the decision to give blood . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	246	If the driver is not told at the outset of the role of the doctor it will be for the justices to decide whether that omission prejudiced the driver and deprived him of the opportunity to make an informed decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	247	The decisions of the Divisional Court in the cases of Jackson and Stanley I now return to the decisions of the Divisional Court in the two cases to consider whether those decisions were correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hutton
242	248	In Jackson I consider that the Divisional Court was right to reject the defendant 's argument that the statement to the police sergeant `` I do n't like needles '' raised a potential medical reason for not providing a specimen of blood . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hutton
242	249	It was a question of fact whether the statement raised a potential medical reason , and the Divisional Court was entitled to find on the facts of the case that the police officer was not under an obligation to investigate further . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hutton
242	250	As regards the other main argument of the defendant which succeeded before the Divisional Court , I am in agreement , as I have stated , with the view expressed by the Divisional Court , and to which it would have given effect if it had not considered itself bound by the Warren decision , that there is no need for a police officer to ask whether there are non-medical reasons for a blood specimen not being given . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hutton
242	251	Moreover the defendant made it entirely clear to the police officer that he was not going to give a specimen of blood or urine , and therefore the defendant suffered no prejudice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hutton
242	252	Accordingly I consider that the appeal of the Director of Public Prosecutions should succeed and I would set aside the order of the Divisional Court , but the appellant does not seek an order that the case be remitted to the justices . 	lord hutton	self	outcome	1	lord hutton
242	253	I have sought to answer the certified question in the body of this judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hutton
242	254	In Stanley 's case in respect of the first argument advanced on behalf of the defendant I consider that the Divisional Court was right to hold that it was a question of fact whether the statement `` No , I do n't want no needle '' raised a medical issue which required further enquiry from the police officer , and that it was open to the Crown Court to conclude on the evidence that it did not amount to a medical reason . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hutton
242	255	The second issue raised before the Divisional Court was that specified in the question certified by it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hutton
242	256	The question is stated in general terms and is not confined to the specific facts of the case , and I have sought to answer the general question in the body of this judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hutton
242	257	Applying the judgment to the second point raised on behalf of the defendant and having regard to the specific facts of the case , I consider that the Divisional Court was correct in rejecting that point and in upholding the conviction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hutton
242	258	I am of this opinion because the defendant was told by the police officer that a blood specimen would be taken by a doctor and the police officer also said to him `` I should tell you that your only right to object to giving blood and to give urine instead will be for medical reasons to be determined by a medical practitioner . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hutton
242	259	I consider therefore that the omission to ask expressly the question whether there were any medical reasons for his refusal to supply a specimen of blood did not cause any injustice to the defendant because that question was implicit in the statement that he had a right to object for medical reasons to be determined by a medical practitioner and did not raise a reasonable possibility that the defendant had been deprived of the opportunity to exercise the option under section 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- or caused him to exercise it in a way that he would not have done had that question been asked . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hutton
242	260	Therefore I would dismiss the appeal of the defendant Stanley . 	lord hutton	self	outcome	1	lord hutton
