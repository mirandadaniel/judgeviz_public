114	2	LORD BINGHAM OF CORNHILL 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	4	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	5	In this appeal two barristers -LRB- Mr Bernard Weatherill QC and Ms Josephine Hayes -RRB- challenge a wasted costs order made against them by the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	6	They do so on two grounds : first , that the court had no jurisdiction to make the order ; and second , that such an order should not have been made when they were precluded by legal professional privilege from answering the complaints made against them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	7	The appeal requires the House , for the first time , to consider the wasted costs order regime introduced by section 4 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 and expressed in section 51 -LRB- 6 -RRB- -LRB- 7 -RRB- and -LRB- 13 -RRB- of the Supreme Court Act 1981 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	8	The proceedings 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	9	The proceedings in which the wasted costs order was made against the barristers concerned a snooker-based television quiz game , originally conceived by Mr Michael Kemp in about 1984 and developed in its early stages in 1987 , first by Mr Kemp and Mr Roger Medcalf and then by these two with the addition of Mr Mardell , who had professional experience of developing and exploiting television game shows and was involved both personally and through his company , originally named Createl Ltd and then the Terry Mardell Organisation Ltd -LRB- `` the TMO '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	10	The plans for this new game show went through various different versions and were the subject of much discussion and refinement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	11	Presentations were made on several occasions to the BBC , which was slow to respond . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	12	In the end , however , the BBC did respond . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	13	It bought the new game show and programmes were transmitted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	14	They have proved to be a continuing success . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	15	But from about the end of 1987 Mr Medcalf was excluded from any part in the development and exploitation of the project , which were handled by Mr Mardell and his company and Mr Kemp . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	16	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	17	In July 1993 Mr Medcalf issued proceedings against Mr Mardell , Mr Kemp , the BBC -LRB- which settled before the action came to trial and played no further part -RRB- and the TMO . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	18	Mr Medcalf 's claim at that stage was based on alleged infringement of copyright and breach of confidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	19	The action came on for trial before Lightman J in January 1997 but was aborted on the third day of trial to enable Mr Medcalf 's advisers to re-plead his case so as to include an additional claim in partnership . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	20	A stringent order in costs was made against Mr Medcalf as a condition of the postponement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	21	Mr Medcalf 's case was then re-pleaded and a second trial took place before Lloyd J in May 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	22	At this trial the judge preferred the evidence of Mr Medcalf to that of Mr Mardell and Mr Kemp . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	23	He found that there had been a partnership between the three men to be inferred from their conduct and that there had also been a breach of confidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	24	The defendants were ordered to provide an account of the profits of the partnership and to make an interim payment of # 100,000 into court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	25	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	26	Mr Mardell and the TMO -LRB- but not Mr Kemp -RRB- at once appealed against the judge 's decision and there was a second appeal against certain orders made by the judge in a later decision on the taking of the partnership accounts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	27	No satisfactory account was provided in compliance with the judge 's order and in July 1999 Mr Medcalf applied to strike out the defendants ' third attempt to provide the account ordered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	28	In response the defendants served witness statements making , for the first time , serious allegations of fraud against Mr Medcalf and his solicitors in connection with the conduct of the action before Lloyd J . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	29	It was alleged that Mr Medcalf or his solicitors had tampered with the transcripts of evidence given at the trial , that Mr Medcalf 's solicitors had attempted to pervert the course of justice during without prejudice discussions with Mr Kemp and that Mr Medcalf 's signature on his witness statement had been forged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	30	No transcripts of evidence had been available to the judge when he had given judgment and Mr Medcalf in evidence had vouched the proof of his witness statement , but these points were relied on as impugning the credibility of Mr Medcalf , and the reliability of his evidence had been an important issue at the trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	31	The master referred the striking out application to Lloyd J , who was to have heard it on 26 November 1999 but who was in the event unable to hear it until 2 December 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	32	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	33	Neither of the appellant barristers had up to then represented Mr Mardell or the TMO . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	34	Ms Hayes was instructed shortly before 24 November . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	35	On 25 November she informed leading counsel for Mr Medcalf -LRB- Mr Romie Tager QC -RRB- of an application she intended to make -LRB- and shortly thereafter did make -RRB- to the judge , that he should direct the police to investigate the allegations made concerning the transcripts and the perversion of the course of justice and that Mr Medcalf 's application to strike out the account should meanwhile be stayed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	36	Mr Medcalf 's solicitors intimated an intention to apply for a wasted costs order against the defendants ' solicitors , although this was not pursued . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	37	In her skeleton argument for the hearing before Lloyd J on 2 December Ms Hayes included the allegations of misconduct already mentioned but with the addition of certain serious allegations of a similar character . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	38	An amended notice of appeal was drafted , although not formally served , including these and additional allegations of impropriety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	39	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	40	On 6 December 1999 Lloyd J rejected the defendants ' application and refused permission to appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	41	He went on to hear Mr Medcalf 's application to strike out the defendants ' third partnership account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	42	Mr Weatherill , appeared before the judge with Ms Hayes on 8 December 1999 -LRB- having been instructed on that date or shortly before -RRB- when application was made that the judge should defer giving judgment on the striking out application pending receipt of evidence from the United States Department of Justice which might substantiate one of the allegations of fraud made against Mr Medcalf . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	43	This application was refused . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	44	On Mr Medcalf 's application to strike out the judge refused to make the order sought , but held that the third account which the defendants had given did not comply with his order and that they should have a last opportunity to comply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	45	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	46	There was intense interlocutory activity on the part of Mr Medcalf and the defendants over the next two months . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	47	Relevantly for present purposes , the defendants ' appeal against the judge 's substantive decision in favour of Mr Medcalf , coupled with an application by the defendants to amend their notice of appeal so as to include the allegations of impropriety against Mr Medcalf already referred to , were due to be heard by the Court of Appeal on 14 February 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	48	At a hearing on 28 January 2000 Clarke LJ gave directions to ensure that that date would be effective : among other things he ordered that evidence in the defendants ' possession relevant to matters raised in the draft amended notice of appeal be served that day , with an indication in writing of any further evidence the defendants might wish to put before the court , and that the defendants should by 4 February 2000 issue and serve an application to amend their notice of appeal and to introduce fresh evidence , serve and file a bundle comprising all witness statements and evidence intended to be relied on , and serve and file a draft amended notice of appeal and supporting skeleton arguments covering those of the existing grounds of appeal still advanced and identifying any which were abandoned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	49	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	50	In response to that order of Clarke LJ , the defendants served certain reports and listed evidence which was not in their possession but which they hoped would follow . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	51	A draft amended notice of appeal dated 3 February 2000 , bearing the names of both barristers , was served on the following day . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	52	Skeleton arguments dated 4 February 2000 , including a supplementary skeleton argument in support of the application to amend the notice of appeal signed by both the barristers , were also served on 4 February . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	53	The supplementary skeleton argument advanced submissions in support of each of the new allegations of fraud , forgery and other impropriety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	54	Two additional bundles of evidence were served on Mr Medcalf . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	55	In the course of Friday 4 February 2000 , for reasons which have not been disclosed , instructions were withdrawn from the defendants ' solicitors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	56	The barristers ceased to be instructed and the solicitors came off the record on Monday 7 February . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	57	During the following week Mr Medcalf 's advisers prepared and filed evidence to rebut the allegations of fraud and impropriety raised in the draft amended notice of appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	58	This evidence was not served on the barristers , who were no longer acting , but they were again instructed at about midday on Friday 11 February and the evidence was then made available to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	59	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	60	At the hearing before the Court of Appeal -LRB- Peter Gibson and Schiemann LJJ and Wilson J -RRB- on Monday 14 February , Mr Weatherill and Ms Hayes , acting -LRB- as it is accepted that they did throughout -RRB- on instructions , opened the defendants ' application to amend the notice of appeal and to adduce new evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	61	The application to amend failed in respect of the allegations of impropriety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	62	In the course of argument Mr Weatherill abandoned some of the allegations in the face of judicial hostility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	63	In relation to the remaining allegations , the Court of Appeal rejected the application to amend -LRB- although other parts of the application to amend were conceded or were successful -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	64	This application occupied about one and a half days of court time , although no oral answer on behalf of Mr Medcalf was called for . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	65	A further two and a half days were devoted to argument on the substantive appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	66	On 2 March 2000 the Court of Appeal handed down a unanimous reserved judgment , giving its reasons for rejecting the application to amend in respect of the defendants ' allegations of fraud and impropriety and dismissing the substantive appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	67	Counsel for Mr Medcalf indicated that he would be seeking a wasted costs order against the barristers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	68	This matter was adjourned to enable Mr Medcalf to state his case and to enable the barristers to respond . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	69	At a hearing on 2 July 2000 the Court of Appeal ordered that this application proceed to a second stage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	70	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	71	Before that application was resolved , Mr Medcalf compromised his action against Mr Mardell , Mr Kemp and the TMO . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	72	The terms of the compromise are not material , save to note that it expressly preserved and excluded Mr Medcalf 's claim for wasted costs against the barristers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	73	The principal basis upon which counsel for Mr Medcalf advanced the application for wasted costs against the barristers was that it had been improper of them as counsel for the defendants to have advanced allegations of fraud and other improprieties in the draft amended notice of appeal , in the supplementary skeleton argument and at the hearing of the appeal when , in contravention of paragraph 606 of the Code of Conduct of the Bar of England and Wales , they could not have had before them reasonably credible material establishing a prima facie case of fraud . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	74	Mr Medcalf sought to recover as wasted costs the costs said to have been incurred in investigating and rebutting the allegations made , both by way of written evidence and oral argument at the hearing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	75	Paragraph 606 of the Code of Conduct 11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn

114	95	In Ridehalgh v Horsefield -LSB- 1994 -RSB- Ch 205 the Court of Appeal heard a composite group of six test appeals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	96	Both the Bar and the Law Society were represented by leading counsel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	97	At the invitation of the court , the Attorney General nominated two counsel to represent the general public interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	98	In a reserved judgment of the court , the Court of Appeal -LRB- Sir Thomas Bingham MR , Rose and Waite LJJ -RRB- reviewed at some length the history of the court 's jurisdiction to order payment of costs by legal practitioners whose conduct had led to the incurring of unnecessary costs , made detailed reference to the rules and legislation governing the exercise of this jurisdiction , drew attention to certain obvious dangers to which the jurisdiction was subject and gave guidance on the future handling of such applications .

NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	100	It does however appear , from material laid before the House , that the clear warnings given in that case have not proved sufficient to deter parties from incurring large and disproportionate sums of costs in pursuing protracted claims for wasted costs , many of which have proved unsuccessful .

114	104	Opinion was divided . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	105	Peter Gibson and Schiemann LJJ -LRB- for reasons given by Peter Gibson LJ on behalf of both -RRB- held that a wasted costs order should be made against the barristers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn

114	107	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	108	In paragraph 25 of the majority judgment , Peter Gibson LJ recorded that there was no dispute as to the jurisdiction to make a wasted costs order nor as to the principles to be applied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	109	Full reference was made to Ridehalgh . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	110	The crux of Mr Tager 's case -LRB- for Mr Medcalf -RRB- was that the barristers had acted improperly , in breach of paragraph 606 of the Code of Conduct , in making allegations of fraud unsupported by any reasonably credible material establishing a prima facie case : see paragraph 35 of the judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	111	The defence advanced by Mr Davidson QC on behalf of the barristers was summarised in paragraph 39 of the judgment : `` He says that the fundamental point was that this was a case in which it appeared that the court had been deceived at the trial and that it was right and in the public interest for advocates to bring that point forward for adjudication . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	112	His main line of defence , however , was based on the fact that , despite the best efforts of the solicitors acting for the barristers , the defendants have not responded to requests that they waive privilege so as to enable the barristers to refer to privileged material in defending the wasted costs claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	113	The barristers have put in evidence that they were fully aware of their duties under the Code of Conduct and believed that they complied with those duties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	114	They say that they would like to put before the court full details of what material was available , their own consideration of it and their reasoning but are prevented by the law of privilege and confidentiality from doing so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	115	They believe that if they could do so , no wasted costs order would be made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	116	Mr Davidson submits that it is impossible for this court to know on what material the barristers acted , that it is unfair to the barristers , who are unable to give evidence on privileged and confidential matters , for us to draw inferences as to the available material or to exercise our discretion as to whether an order should be made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	117	He and his junior , Miss Mulcahy , have drawn our attention to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and to the cases decided thereunder . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	118	They submit that it would be a contravention of that Article to decide this case in circumstances where the barristers can not give evidence on material matters whereas Mr Medcalf is able to bring forward all the evidence in his possession on what they call ` the key issue of fact ' .

114	119	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	120	The majority began by considering the allegations of fraud in the draft amended notice of appeal in order to assess whether there was a possibility that the barristers had had other material . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	121	This review was prefaced by certain preliminary observations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	122	First , the majority emphasised the importance of paragraph 606 , which gave litigating parties a measure of redress against potentially very damaging allegations for which -LRB- because of the law of absolute privilege -RRB- they could obtain no redress . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	123	Thus a barrister must be instructed to make the allegation in question , and should have reasonably credible material establishing a prima facie case before drafting such an allegation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	124	The judgment continued -LRB- paragraph 40 -RRB- : `` The material must be evidence which can be put before the court to make good the allegation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	125	If there is material before counsel which can not be used in court , the existence of that material can not justify the actions of counsel in putting their names to the allegation . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	126	Secondly , it was said that paragraph 606 applied not only to allegations of fraud but also to other allegations of dishonest or dishonourable conduct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	127	Thirdly , the majority made plain that counsel must maintain his independence and not compromise his professional standards in order to please the client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	128	In its review of 10 allegations made by the defendants , the majority held that no reasonably credible material had been produced to the court to justify seven , while concluding that there was some evidence to support the remaining three . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	129	In considering whether , on the material put before the court , the conduct of the barristers had been shown to be improper , unreasonable or negligent , the majority commented on the peripheral character of these allegations in relation to the main issues in the action -LRB- paragraph 54 -RRB- and based its finding against the barristers primarily on the failure to produce evidence to the court to support the allegations made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	130	In paragraph 58 of its judgment the majority said : `` Second , the barristers could not have allowed the draft amended notice of appeal to go out under their names to Mr Medcalf containing allegations of impropriety reliant on the expected contents of the witness statements without the barristers satisfying themselves of the existence of that evidence in a form to be put before the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	131	We emphasise that the duty under section 606 is one personal to counsel and can not be delegated to his solicitors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	132	He has to satisfy himself that he has reasonable credible material before him which as it stands establishes a prima facie case of fraud when he drafts the notice of appeal . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	133	In paragraph 59 the majority held that the propriety of the pleading had to be assessed in the light of the material put before the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	134	It was not persuaded -LRB- paragraph 60 -RRB- that the inability of the barristers to reveal privileged or confidential material made the hearing of the application unfair or contrary to article 6 of the European Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	135	While acknowledging the high professional standing of the barristers , the majority found no reasons why , in the exercise of the court 's discretion , it should deny Mr Medcalf the order he sought -LRB- paragraph 64 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	136	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	137	In his dissenting judgment Wilson J compressed into six the seven allegations on which the majority had found against the barristers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	138	He agreed that , at the hearing , no reasonably credible evidence had been placed before the court which prima facie established the validity of those six allegations made against Mr Medcalf -LRB- paragraph 72 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	139	But in his opinion that was not the point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	140	The point was whether the barristers had had such material before them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	141	Wilson J first considered the barristers ' position on 3-4 February when the draft amended notice of appeal had been finalised and the skeleton arguments delivered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	142	He said -LRB- in paragraphs 78-80 -RRB- : `` 78 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	143	I harbour doubts whether on 3 and 4 February the barristers had before them the material which justified their making the six allegations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	144	All six of them had figured in drafts of Ms Hayes dating back to early December 1999 so there had already been two months in which to collect the evidence to justify them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	145	In the drafting of the jointly signed notice dated 3 February it is hard to discern selection , as opposed to blanket repetition , of -LRB- to use Mr Weatherill 's own description at the hearing -RRB- the gallimaufry of allegations which on instructions had been assembled in the drafts of Ms Hayes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	146	79 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	147	But , in the complete absence of evidence as to what the barristers actually had before them on 3 and 4 February , I have insufficient confidence in the fertility of my imagination to come to a positive conclusion that they could not have had before them whatever paragraph 606 required . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	148	80 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	149	There is an initial question as to what paragraph 606 did require to be before them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	150	The words refer to ` reasonably credible material which as it stands establishes a prima facie case of fraud ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	151	In paragraph 58 above my Lords so construe those words as to require the barristers to have before them reasonably credible evidence , in a form to be put before the court , which establishes the prima facie case . 	lord bingham	all	partagr	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	152	My view is that the word ` material ' goes wider than evidence in proper form ; that the phrase ` as it stands ' just means ` at face value ' ; and that to construe the word ` establishes ' as something which can be achieved only by evidence admissible in court is , in this context , arguably to read too much into it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	153	My own preference would be not to adopt any such paraphrase . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	154	Wilson J raised a series of questions relating to the material which might have been before the barristers on 3-4 February and concluded : `` 84 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	155	Answers to such questions might well have enabled me to concur in the conclusion of my Lords . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	156	Or they might have had the reverse effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	157	Lacking the answers , I remain in doubt as to whether on 3 and 4 February the barristers were guilty of professional impropriety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	158	It is doubt of which , pursuant to the same passage in Ridehalgh v Horsefield , they must have the benefit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	159	It is better that in certain circumstances the wasted costs jurisdiction should be emasculated by the principle of legal professional privilege than vice versa . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	160	Of the hearing on 14-15 February he said -LRB- in paragraph 85 -RRB- that `` There was therefore an element of professional impropriety in articulation of these serious allegations at the hearing '' in the absence of evidence to support them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	161	In the exercise of his discretion , however , Wilson J would have declined to make an order against the barristers on this limited ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	162	In reaching this conclusion he was impressed by the extremely difficult circumstances in which both barristers , but particularly Mr Weatherill , had been called upon to act in this complex and highly contentious matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	163	Jurisdiction 18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	164	The barristers ' argument on jurisdiction was first raised in the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	165	It was said , first , that section 51 conferred no right on a party to seek a wasted costs order against any legal representative other than his own . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	166	Thus the court had no power to make an order against the legal representative of any opposing party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	167	This submission was based on the wording of section 51 -LRB- 13 -RRB- quoted above , and in particular the words `` on his behalf '' : it was argued that a party could only seek a wasted costs order against a person exercising a right of audience or a right to conduct litigation on his behalf or any employee of such a person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	168	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	169	There are in my opinion very compelling reasons why this construction can not reflect the intention of Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	170	It is clear that in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction the court could order a solicitor to compensate a party who was not the client of that solicitor , as it did in Myers v Elman -LSB- 1940 -RSB- AC 282 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	171	In Orchard v South Eastern Electricity Board -LSB- 1987 -RSB- QB 565 , 571 , 581 , the Court of Appeal expressly dissented from the view , advanced obiter by Lord Denning MR in Kelly v London Transport Executive -LSB- 1982 -RSB- 1 WLR 1055 , 1065 , that this jurisdiction could be exercised against counsel also . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	172	In the context of the 1990 Act , which among other things provided for a substantial extension of solicitors ' rights of audience in the higher courts , this inequality of treatment as between advocates performing the same professional function was plainly indefensible , and the object of section 51 -LRB- 6 -RRB- and -LRB- 7 -RRB- was to put barristers and solicitors , for this purpose , effectively in the same position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	173	Section 51 only applies in civil proceedings , but -LRB- as was accepted on behalf of the barristers -RRB- it is quite clear from section 111 of the 1990 Act -LRB- amending the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 -RRB- and section 112 of the 1990 Act -LRB- amending the Magistrates ' Courts Act 1980 -RRB- that in criminal proceedings in the Court of Appeal , the Crown Court or a magistrates ' court and civil proceedings in a magistrates ' court a wasted costs order may be made in favour of a party to the proceedings against the legal representative of any other party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	174	No reason has been advanced why Parliament should have wished to lay down a different rule governing barristers in civil proceedings in the High Court , and it is to my mind inconceivable in the context of the 1990 Act that Parliament should have wished to afford to barristers in civil proceedings -LRB- otherwise than in a magistrates court -RRB- a ground of exemption not enjoyed by solicitors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	175	Against arguments of this weight , any submission based on the wording of subsection -LRB- 13 -RRB- would have to be irresistible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	176	The barristers ' argument is not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	177	The subsection is intended to make plain that no liability can attach to any practitioner not involved in the litigation giving rise to the claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	178	I note without surprise that a similar conclusion was reached by Neuberger J in Brown v Bennett -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 WLR 713 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	179	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	180	The barristers ' second argument on jurisdiction was also based on the language of subsection -LRB- 13 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	181	It was to the effect that any order made against them could only relate to their conduct when exercising a right of audience in court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	182	This was because they had no right to conduct litigation , as defined in sections 28 and 119 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1990 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	183	Thus -LRB- it was said -RRB- they could not be liable in wasted costs for anything done when settling the draft amended notice of appeal or the skeleton arguments , the activities which had in fact given rise to most of the wasted costs claimed against them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	184	A similar argument was advanced to and rejected by Leveson J in Worsley v Tambrands Ltd -LRB- unreported , 8 November 2000 -RRB- and also by Neuberger J in Brown v Bennett -LRB- No 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	185	Both judges were right to reject it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	186	Section 4 of the 1990 Act substituted a new section 51 in the 1981 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	187	Once inserted that section was to be read as part of the 1981 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	188	Its interpretation was to be governed by its own terms and any other terms of the 1981 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	189	I would question whether it would be permissible in principle to construe subsection -LRB- 13 -RRB- in the light of definitions imported into the 1990 Act for quite different purposes : see Bennion , Statutory Interpretation 3rd ed , -LRB- 1997 -RRB- , p 213 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	190	The section was intended , as already stated , simply to make plain that no liability could attach to any practitioner not involved in the litigation giving rise to the claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	191	For the reasons convincingly given by Leveson J it would stultify the section if a barrister were not potentially liable for conduct immediately relevant to the exercise of a right of audience but not involving advocacy in open court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	192	If one might have thought subsection -LRB- 13 -RRB- to be unnecessary , the facts of Byrne v Sefton Health Authority -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 WLR 775 show that it was not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	193	The construction of paragraph 606 of the Code of Conduct 21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	194	As is evident from the quotations from the judgments of the majority and the minority in the Court of Appeal set out in paragraphs 16 and 17 above , there was a difference of opinion on the interpretation of paragraph 606 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	195	The majority held that , when putting his signature to an allegation of fraud or dishonesty , counsel must have before him evidence in a form to be put before the court to make good the allegation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	196	Wilson J held that counsel must have `` material '' but that it need not be evidence in admissible form . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	197	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	198	Paragraph 606 -LRB- c -RRB- lays down an important and salutary principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	199	The parties to contested actions are often at daggers drawn , and the litigious process serves to exacerbate the hostility between them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	200	Such clients are only too ready to make allegations of the most damaging kind against each other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	201	While counsel should never lend his name to such allegations unless instructed to do so , the receipt of instructions is not of itself enough . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	202	Counsel is bound to exercise an objective professional judgment whether it is in all the circumstances proper to lend his name to the allegation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	203	As the rule recognises , counsel could not properly judge it proper to make such an allegation unless he had material before him which he judged to be reasonably credible and which appeared to justify the allegation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	204	At the hearing stage , counsel can not properly make or persist in an allegation which is unsupported by admissible evidence , since if there is not admissible evidence to support the allegation the court can not be invited to find that it has been proved , and if the court can not be invited to find that the allegation has been proved the allegation should not be made or should be withdrawn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	205	I would however agree with Wilson J that at the preparatory stage the requirement is not that counsel should necessarily have before him evidence in admissible form but that he should have material of such a character as to lead responsible counsel to conclude that serious allegations could properly be based upon it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	206	I could not think , for example , that it would be professionally improper for counsel to plead allegations , however serious , based on the documented conclusions of a DTI inspector or a public inquiry , even though counsel had no access to the documents referred to and the findings in question were inadmissible hearsay . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	207	On this point I would accept the judgment of Wilson J. Legal professional privilege 23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	208	In Ridehalgh v Horsefield -LSB- 1994 -RSB- Ch 205 the Court of Appeal addressed the issue of legal professional privilege which may arise where an applicant seeks a wasted costs order against lawyers acting for an opposing party and at page 237B-D of its judgment it said : `` The respondent lawyers are in a different position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	209	The privilege is not theirs to waive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	210	In the usual case where a waiver would not benefit their client they will be slow to advise the client to waive his privilege , and they may well feel bound to advise that the client should take independent advice before doing so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	211	The client may be unwilling to do that , and may be unwilling to waive if he does . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	212	So the respondent lawyers may find themselves at a grave disadvantage in defending their conduct of proceedings , unable to reveal what advice and warnings they gave , what instructions they received . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	213	In some cases this potential source of injustice may be mitigated by reference to the taxing master , where different rules apply , but only in a small minority of cases can this procedure be appropriate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	214	Judges who are invited to make or contemplate making a wasted costs order must make full allowance for the inability of the respondent lawyers to tell the whole story . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	215	Where there is room for doubt , the respondent lawyers are entitled to the benefit of it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	216	It is again only when , with all allowances made , a lawyer 's conduct of proceedings is quite plainly unjustifiable that it can be appropriate to make a wasted costs order . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	217	I do not for my part consider this passage to be inaccurate or misleading , and counsel did not criticise it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	218	Read literally and applied with extreme care , it ought to offer appropriate protection to a practitioner against whom a wasted costs order is sought in these circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	219	But with the benefit of experience over the intervening years it seems clear that the passage should be strengthened by emphasising two matters in particular . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	220	First , in a situation in which the practitioner is of necessity precluded -LRB- in the absence of a waiver by the client -RRB- from giving his account of the instructions he received and the material before him at the time of settling the impugned document , the court must be very slow to conclude that a practitioner could have had no sufficient material . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	221	Speculation is one thing , the drawing of inferences sufficiently strong to support orders potentially very damaging to the practitioner concerned is another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	222	The point was well put by Mr George Laurence QC sitting as a deputy High Court judge in Drums and Packaging Ltd v Freeman -LRB- unreported , 6 August 1999 -RRB- when he said , at paragraph 43 : `` As it happens , privilege having been waived , the whole story has been told . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	223	I can not help wondering whether I would have arrived at the same conclusion had privilege not been waived . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	224	It would not have been particularly easy , in that event , to make the necessary full allowance for the firm 's inability to tell the whole story . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	225	On the facts known to D3 at the time it launched this application , D3 might very well have concluded that the firm would not be able to avoid a wasted costs order , even on the ` every allowance ' basis recommended by : -LSB- Sir Thomas Bingham MR -RSB- . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	226	Only rarely will the court be able to make `` full allowance '' for the inability of the practitioner to tell the whole story or to conclude that there is no room for doubt in a situation in which , of necessity , the court is deprived of access to the full facts on which , in the ordinary way , any sound judicial decision must be based . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	227	The second qualification is no less important . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	228	The court should not make an order against a practitioner precluded by legal professional privilege from advancing his full answer to the complaint made against him without satisfying itself that it is in all the circumstances fair to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	229	This reflects the old rule , applicable in civil and criminal proceedings alike , that a party should not be condemned without an adequate opportunity to be heard . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	230	Even if the court were able properly to be sure that the practitioner could have no answer to the substantive complaint , it could not fairly make an order unless satisfied that nothing could be said to influence the exercise of its discretion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	231	Only exceptionally could these exacting conditions be satisfied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	232	Where a wasted costs order is sought against a practitioner precluded by legal professional privilege from giving his full answer to the application , the court should not make an order unless , proceeding with extreme care , it is -LRB- a -RRB- satisfied that there is nothing the practitioner could say , if unconstrained , to resist the order and -LRB- b -RRB- that it is in all the circumstances fair to make the order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	233	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	234	It was not submitted to the House that a relaxation of the existing rules on legal professional privilege could or should be permitted in a case such as the present : the decision of the House in R v Derby Magistrates ' Court , Ex parte B -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 487 gave no encouragement to such a submission , and subordinate legislation introduced to modify that decision for purposes of the wasted costs jurisdiction was held to be ultra vires in General Mediterranean Holdings SA v Patel -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 1 WLR 272 and was revoked .

114	235	No attempt has been made to modify the rule by primary legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	236	The result no doubt is that in a context such as the present the scope for making wasted costs orders is very limited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	237	This is not necessarily to be regretted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	238	In Ridehalgh v Horsefield -LSB- 1994 -RSB- Ch 205 , 238-239 the Court of Appeal considered that wasted costs hearings should be measured in hours and urged the courts to be astute to control what threatened to become a new and costly form of satellite litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	239	In Harley v McDonald -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 2 AC 678 , reviewing the exercise by the New Zealand courts of the inherent jurisdiction to order barristers and solicitors to pay costs unnecessarily incurred , the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council observed -LRB- at p 703 , para 50 -RRB- : `` As a general rule allegations of breach of duty relating to the conduct of the case by a barrister or solicitor with a view to the making of a costs order should be confined strictly to questions which are apt for summary disposal by the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	240	Failures to appear , conduct which leads to an otherwise avoidable step in the proceedings or the prolongation of a hearing by gross repetition or extreme slowness in the presentation of evidence or argument are typical examples . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	241	The factual basis for the exercise of the jurisdiction in such circumstances is likely to be found in facts which are within judicial knowledge because the relevant events took place in court or are facts that can easily be verified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	242	Wasting the time of the court or an abuse of its processes which results in excessive or unnecessary cost to litigants can thus be dealt with summarily on agreed facts or after a brief inquiry if the facts are not all agreed . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	243	Save in the clearest case , applications against the lawyers acting for an opposing party are unlikely to be apt for summary determination , since any hearing to investigate the conduct of a complex action is itself likely to be expensive and time-consuming . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	244	The desirability of compensating litigating parties who have been put to unnecessary expense by the unjustified conduct of their opponents ' lawyers is , without doubt , an important public interest , but it is , as the Court of Appeal pointed out in Ridehalgh at page 226 , only one of the public interests which have to be considered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	245	The present appeal 25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	246	Proceeding from the undoubted fact -LRB- with which Wilson J agreed -RRB- that at the hearing on 14-15 February there was no reasonably credible admissible evidence before the court to substantiate the seven allegations held to be improperly made , the majority of the Court of Appeal concluded that the barristers could have had no such admissible evidence before them when signing the draft amended notice of appeal and the skeleton arguments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	247	It would seem likely that they did not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	248	But this was to apply too stringent a test . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	249	The question is whether , at that stage , the barristers had material of any kind before them which justified the making of the allegations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	250	This is something which the court does not know and can not be told . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	251	Hunch and suspicion are not enough . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	252	Like Wilson J , and for the reasons given in his persuasive judgment , I remain in doubt , and the barristers must have the benefit of that doubt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	253	In a case of this complexity , I would moreover think it unfair and contrary to the appearance of justice to condemn them unheard . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	254	While the Strasbourg jurisprudence to which the House was referred fortifies that conclusion -LRB- see , for example , De Haes and Gijsels v Belgium -LRB- 1997 -RRB- 25 EHRR 1 at p 48 , paras 80-81 -RRB- I do not think it relies on any principle not recognised by the common law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	255	Again like Wilson J , I would not think it right to base even a partial order on the barristers ' failure to abandon the objectionable allegations at the outset of the proceedings on 14 February . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	256	They do not appear to have clung to these allegations with undue tenacity , and the matters relied on by Wilson J as influencing the exercise of discretion can not be lightly discounted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn

114	259	Save in relation to the transcript allegation , I am also in full agreement with the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough : on that matter I differ from him because the transcript allegation , although weaker on its face than the other allegations , was not different in kind ; and also because I share the view expressed by Lord Rodger in paragraph 76 below . 	lord bingham	lord hobhouse	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn

114	261	Despite the highly regrettable outcome for Mr Medcalf , whose successful proceedings have had severe financial consequences for him , I would allow the barristers ' appeal , quash the wasted costs order made by the Court of Appeal and award the barristers the costs of and occasioned by the wasted costs application both in the Court of Appeal and before the House -LRB- such order not to be enforced without leave of the Court of Appeal in relation to any period when Mr Medcalf was legally-aided -RRB- . 	lord bingham	self	outcome	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn

114	263	Well after the conclusion of argument , at a stage when the opinions of the committee were in final draft , material was received from the barristers suggesting that Mr Mardell and the TMO were or might be willing after all to waive their entitlement to legal professional privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn

114	265	It was unanimously resolved that the appeal should be decided on the basis upon which it had been argued both in the Court of Appeal and before the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn

114	271	I limit my remarks to the question whether the two barristers against whom wasted costs orders were made by a majority in the Court of Appeal had a fair opportunity to deploy their side of the case : Medcalf v Mardell -LSB- 2001 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep PN 146 .

114	273	The legislation empowering the making of wasted costs orders did not expressly address the problem which arises where a barrister is prevented by legal professional privilege from explaining what instructions and material he received from his client : section 51 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	274	Subsequently , the decision of the House of Lords in R v Derby Magistrates Court , Ex p B -LSB- 1996 -RSB- 1 AC 487 , 507D , ascribed to legal professional privilege an absolute character . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn

114	278	It was common ground before the House that in the wasted costs jurisdiction under section 51 , the court had no power to relax the privilege so as to enable a barrister to defend himself against allegations of improper conduct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	279	Where a client seeks a wasted costs order against his barrister , a waiver of privilege in relation to all relevant matters will be implied by law : Lillicrap v Nalder & Son -LSB- 1993 -RSB- 1 WLR 94 ; Matthews and Malek , Disclosure , 2nd ed , -LRB- 2001 -RRB- p 297 .

114	351	The 1990 Act restructured the legal professions and the interrelation between the roles of solicitors and barristers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	352	It recognised that advocacy functions could be carried out by both branches and extended the power to make orders for costs not only against solicitors exercising the right to conduct litigation on behalf of a party but also against any advocate exercising a right of audience : s. 51 -LRB- 13 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	353	Section 51 is a provision dealing generally with the jurisdiction to make orders as to costs including a general power to determine by whom and to what extent costs of the proceedings are to be paid : s. 51 -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	354	The ` wasted costs ' jurisdiction is supplementary and subsection -LRB- 6 -RRB- empowers the court both to disallow costs which have been wasted by a legal representative as between the lawyer and his own client and to order that the legal representative meet the whole or part of any wasted costs .

114	360	`` Wasted costs '' is a defined expression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	361	Subsection -LRB- 7 -RRB- provides that it means - `` any costs incurred by a party - -LRB- a -RRB- as a result of any improper , unreasonable or negligent act or omission on the part of any legal or other representative or any employee of such a representative ; or -LRB- b -RRB- which , in the light of any such act or omission occurring after they were incurred , the court considers it is unreasonable to expect that party to pay . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	362	The phrase `` legal or other representative '' is that to which I have already referred ; it is defined as covering those who , in respect to a party , are exercising either a right of audience or a right to conduct litigation on the party 's behalf . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	363	The aspect of these provisions with which this appeal is concerned is therefore alleged improper , unreasonable or negligent conduct by someone exercising rights of audience -LRB- ie acting as an advocate -RRB- on behalf of one party which the opposing party says should lead the court to make an order that the advocate should bear part of the costs incurred by that opposing party .

114	364	50 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	365	At first sight , this power to make costs orders against such advocates seems sensible and straight forward . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	366	However this simplicity is deceptive as the subsequent history of the exercise of this jurisdiction has shown . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	367	These complications and pitfalls were discussed in the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the group of cases reported as Ridehalgh v Horsefield -LSB- 1994 -RSB- Ch 205 -LRB- a judgment to which my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill was , as the then Master of the Rolls , a party -RRB- and principled and authoritative solutions provided . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	368	It is apparent from what your lordships have been told from the bar that , notwithstanding that judgment , many of the adverse consequences have persisted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	369	The same message is given in the valuable article by Mr H Evans published at -LRB- 2001 -RRB- 64 MLR 51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	370	In the present case the Court of Appeal , both the majority and the minority , were following the Ridehalgh judgment although this led them to different conclusions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	371	For myself , I would wish to take this opportunity to endorse and reaffirm what was said in that judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	372	But it is clearly necessary to emphasise again some of its features . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	373	The Constitutional Aspect : 51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	374	The starting point must be a recognition of the role of the advocate in our system of justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	375	It is fundamental to a just and fair judicial system that there be available to a litigant -LRB- criminal or civil -RRB- , in substantial cases , competent and independent legal representation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	376	The duty of the advocate is with proper competence to represent his lay client and promote and protect fearlessly and by all proper and lawful means his lay client 's best interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	377	This is a duty which the advocate owes to his client but it is also in the public interest that the duty should be performed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	378	The judicial system exists to administer justice and it is integral to such a system that it provide within a society a means by which rights , obligations and liabilities can be recognised and given effect to in accordance with the law and disputes be justly -LRB- and efficiently -RRB- resolved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	379	The role of the independent professional advocate is central to achieving this outcome , particularly where the judicial system uses adversarial procedures . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	380	52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	381	It follows that the willingness of professional advocates to represent litigants should not be undermined either by creating conflicts of interest or by exposing the advocates to pressures which will tend to deter them from representing certain clients or from doing so effectively . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	382	In England the professional rule that a barrister must be prepared to represent any client within his field of practice and competence and the principles of professional independence underwrite in a manner too often taken for granted this constitutional safeguard . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	383	Unpopular and seemingly unmeritorious litigants must be capable of being represented without the advocate being penalised or harassed whether by the Executive , the Judiciary or by anyone else . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	384	Similarly , situations must be avoided where the advocate 's conduct of a case is influenced not by his duty to his client but by concerns about his own self-interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	385	53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	386	Thus the advocate owes no duty to his client 's opponent ; inevitably , the proper discharge by the advocate of his duty to his own client will more often than not be disadvantageous to the interests of his client 's opponent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	387	-LRB- Orchard v S E Electricity Bd -LSB- 1987 -RSB- QB 565 , 571 -RRB- At times , the proper discharge by the advocate of his duties to his client will be liable to bring him into conflict with the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	388	This does not alter the duty of the advocate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	389	It may require more courage to represent a client in the face of a hostile court but the advocate must still be prepared to act fearlessly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	390	It is part of the duty of an advocate , where necessary , appropriately to protect his client from the court as well as from the opposing party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	391	Similarly , the advocate acting in good faith is entitled to protection from outside pressures for what he does as an advocate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	392	Thus , what the advocate says in the course of the legal proceedings is privileged and he can not be sued for defamation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	393	For similar reasons the others involved in the proceedings -LRB- eg the judge , the witness -RRB- have a similar immunity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	394	54 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	395	The professional advocate is in a privileged position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	396	He is granted rights of audience . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	397	He enjoys certain immunities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	398	In return he owes certain duties to the court and is bound by certain standards of professional conduct in accordance with the code of conduct of his profession . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	399	This again reflects the public interest in the proper administration of justice ; the public interest , covering the litigants themselves as well , is now also expressed in Part I of the Civil Procedure Rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	400	-LRB- See also Practice Direction 16 § 9 . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	401	The advocate must respect and uphold the authority of the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	402	He must not be a knowing party to an abuse of process or a deceit of the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	403	He must conduct himself with reasonable competence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	404	He must take reasonable and practicable steps to avoid unnecessary expense or waste of the court 's time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	405	The codes of conduct of the advocate 's profession spell out the detailed provisions to be derived from the general principles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	406	These include the provisions relevant to barristers which preclude them from making allegations , whether orally or in writing , of fraud or criminal guilt unless he has a proper basis for so doing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	407	Paragraph 606 -LRB- c -RRB- , which has already been quoted by my noble and learned friend , requires express instructions and reasonably credible material which as it stands establishes a prima facie case of fraud . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	408	All this fits in well with an appropriate constitutional structure for a judicial system for the administration of justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	409	55 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	410	The introduction of a wasted costs jurisdiction makes an inroad into this structure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	411	It creates a risk of a conflict of interest for the advocate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	412	It is intended and designed to affect the conduct of the advocate and to do so by penalising him economically . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	413	Ideally a conflict should not arise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	414	The advocate 's duty to his own client is subject to his duty to the court : the advocate 's proper discharge of his duty to his client should not cause him to be accused of being in breach of his duty to the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	415	-LRB- Arthur Hall v Simons -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 3 WLR 543 -RRB- But the situation in which the advocate finds himself may not be so clear cut . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	416	Difficult tactical decisions may have to be made , maybe in difficult circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	417	Opinions can differ , particularly in the heated and stressed arena of litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	418	Once an opposing party is entitled to apply for an order against the other party 's legal representatives , the situation becomes much more unpredictable and hazardous for the advocate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	419	Adversarial perceptions are introduced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	420	This is a feature of what happened in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	421	The factors which may motivate a hostile application by an opponent are liable to be very different from those which would properly motivate a court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	422	56 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	423	In my judgment , the jurisdiction must be approached with considerable caution and the relevant provisions of s. 51 construed and applied so as not to impinge upon the constitutional position of the advocate and the contribution he is required to make on behalf of his client in the administration of civil justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	424	The judgment in Ridehalgh referred to most of the relevant points . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	425	First , from the point of view of the advocate the jurisdiction is penal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	426	It involves making a finding of fault against the advocate and visiting upon him a financial sanction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	427	Unlike the position between the advocate and his own client where the potential for liability will encourage the performance of the advocate 's duty to his client -LRB- see Arthur Hall v Simons , sup -RRB- and the order would be truly compensatory , the jurisdiction to make orders at the instance of and in favour of the opposing party gives rise to wholly different considerations for the advocate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	428	The risk of such an application can , at best , only provide a distraction in the proper representation of his own client and , at worst , may cause him to put his own interests above those of his client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	429	The construction of the section and the application of the jurisdiction should accordingly be no wider than is clearly required by the statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	430	Secondly , the fault must , in the present context , relate clearly to a fault in relation to the advocate 's duty to the court not in relation to the opposing party , to whom he owes no duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	431	Thirdly , the terms used in subsection -LRB- 7 -RRB- should receive an appropriately restrictive interpretation in relation to advocates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	432	The judgment in Ridehalgh spelled this out at p. 232 of the report . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	433	The use of the first two terms , improper and unreasonable , call for no further explanation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	434	The word negligent raises additional problems of interpretation which are not material to the present appeal since the respondents ' allegation against the appellants is impropriety not negligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	435	But it would appear that the inclusion of the word negligent in substitution for `` reasonable competence '' , is directed primarily to the jurisdiction as between a legal representative and his own client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	436	It is possible to visualise situations where the negligence of an advocate might justify the making of a wasted costs order which included both parties , such as where an advocate fails to turn up on an adjourned hearing so that a hearing date is lost . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	437	The breach of the advocate 's duty to the court will be clear and if the breach was not deliberate , the term negligent would best describe it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	438	For a person exercising a right to conduct litigation -LRB- ie a litigation agent -RRB- it is less difficult to think of apt examples affecting the other side as was the situation in Myers v Elman -LSB- 1940 -RSB- AC 282 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	439	The use of the same language in subsection -LRB- 7 -RRB- in relation to both categories of legal representative does not mean that it will have the same breadth of application for both categories . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	440	Fourthly , it is the duty of the advocate to present his client 's case even though he may think that it is hopeless and even though he may have advised his client that it is . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	441	-LRB- Ridehalgh pp.233-4 -RRB- So it is not enough that the court considers that the advocate has been arguing a hopeless case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	442	The litigant is entitled to be heard ; to penalise the advocate for presenting his client 's case to the court would be contrary to the constitutional principles to which I have referred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	443	The position is different if the court concludes that there has been improper time-wasting by the advocate or the advocate has knowingly lent himself to an abuse of process . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	444	However it is relevant to bear in mind that , if a party is raising issues or is taking steps which have no reasonable prospect of success or are scandalous or an abuse of process , both the aggrieved party and the court have powers to remedy the situation by invoking summary remedies - striking out - summary judgment - peremptory orders etc. . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	445	The making of a wasted costs order should not be the primary remedy ; by definition it only arises once the damage has been done . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	446	It is a last resort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	447	Practical Consequences : 57 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	448	The practical consequences of the wider use of the jurisdiction , particularly where the client 's opponent is the applicant , were also commented upon in Ridehalgh . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	449	The first and most striking is that it creates satellite litigation which too easily gets out of proportion to the litigation which has spawned it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	450	The present case provides an educational but far from extreme illustration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	451	The principal trial was not wholly straightforward , involving successive amendments of the pleadings , questions of legal analysis and bitterly contradictory oral evidence but the trial judge was able to deliver his judgment at the end of the trial without having to reserve it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	452	He held in favour of the existence of a partnership and ordered an account of profits . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	453	After various contested interlocutory applications both to the judge and to the Court of Appeal , the Court of Appeal , in March 2000 , unanimously dismissed Mr Mardell 's appeal , dismissing also his application to amend the notice of appeal and adduce fresh evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	454	A month later the main action was settled . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	455	The wasted costs application has occupied the following two years with a further full hearing in the Court of Appeal and an appeal to your Lordships ' House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	456	If the policy of the wasted costs jurisdiction is to reduce the costs of litigation and to save court time , it too often fails to achieve this objective -LRB- as is confirmed by the Modern Law Review article already referred to -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	457	The jurisdiction is discretionary and should be reserved for those cases where the unjustifiable conduct can be demonstrated without recourse to disproportionate procedures . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	458	-LRB- See also Harley v McDonald -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 2 AC 678 . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	459	The jurisdiction does not exist as an end in itself ; it is distinct from the professional disciplinary structures . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	460	The procedures appropriate for wasted costs applications were discussed in Ridehalgh at pp.238-9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	461	58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	462	Once the power to initiate wasted costs procedures is extended to the opposite party in the litigation , that party is provided with a weapon which it is too much to expect he will not on occasions attempt to use to his own advantage in unacceptable ways . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	463	It must not be used as a threat to intimidate the lawyers on the other side . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	464	-LRB- Ridehalgh at p. 237 , citing Orchard v S E Electricity Bd -LSB- 1987 -RSB- QB 565 -RRB- It should not be motivated simply by resentment at an inability to obtain an effective order for costs against an assisted or impecunious litigant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	465	-LRB- Ridehalgh at p. 231 , citing Symphony v Hodgson -LSB- 1994 -RSB- QB 179 -RRB- Nor should it be used as a means of continuing contentious litigation by other means or to obtain from a party 's lawyers what can not be obtained from the party himself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	466	The legitimate interest of an applicant for a wasted costs order is financial , a reduction in the costs he has to bear , but the application must be merits based and clearly made out ; it must not raise a suspicion of being itself abusive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	467	59 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	468	A further consequence of exercising the jurisdiction on the application of an opposite party is that it raises questions of the legal professional privilege of the lawyer 's client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	469	The client very probably will have no interest in waiving the privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	470	Indeed the client may stand to gain if his opponent can look to the client 's lawyer for an indemnity rather than to the client himself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	471	This situation creates a serious problem which may lead to the emasculation of the wasted costs jurisdiction as between the opposing party and the advocate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	472	The appellants argue that in cases such as the present it should do so : fairness requires that the privileged material should be before the court ; if it can not be , the application for wasted costs should fail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	473	They submit that this argument must be conclusive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	474	Legal Professional Privilege : 60 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	475	As already observed by my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn , the nature and extent of legal professional privilege has not been in question on this appeal nor has it been the subject of any argument . 	lord hobhouse	lord steyn	partagr	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	476	Its absolute and paramount character has been accepted by the respondents , citing R v Derby Magistrates ' Court , ex parte ` B ' -LSB- 1996 -RSB- AC 487 and General Mediterranean Holdings v Patel -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 1 WLR 272 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	477	However , the need of a lawyer to be able to ask a court to look at privileged material when a lawyer 's conduct is in question may not be so intractable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	478	The material in question may be confidential rather than absolutely privileged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	479	-LRB- Parry-Jones v The Law Society -LSB- 1969 -RSB- 1 Ch 1 -RRB- It may be possible to restrict the use which can be made of the disclosed material so as to reduce or remove the infringement of the client 's privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	480	-LRB- See per Glidewell LJ in R v Commissioners of Inland Revenue ex parte Taylor -LRB- No. 2 -RRB- 62 TC 578 at p. 588 . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	481	It may be that partially inquisitorial procedures can be adopted , as in the inter partes taxation of costs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	482	It should be remembered that the subject matter of the wasted costs application is an alleged breach of the lawyer 's duty to the court and it is not unique that a lawyer may have to refer to privileged material in the context of explaining himself to the court and defining his relationship to the court as , for example , when a litigation agent is applying to come off the record or a barrister is ceasing to represent an assisted defendant during the course of a criminal trial .

114	483	It may be that , as in the context of Articles 6 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights , the privilege may not always be absolute and a balancing exercise may sometimes be necessary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn

NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	485	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	486	61 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	487	The point was specifically considered in Ridehalgh at pp.236-7 : `` The privilege is not theirs to waive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	488	... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	489	So the respondent lawyers may find themselves at a grave disadvantage in defending their conduct of proceedings , unable to reveal what advice and warnings they gave , what instructions they received . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	490	In some cases this potential source of injustice may be mitigated by reference to the taxing master , where different rules apply , but only in a small minority of cases can this procedure be appropriate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	491	Judges who are invited to make or contemplate making a wasted costs order must make full allowance for the inability of respondent lawyers to tell the whole story . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	492	Where there is room for doubt , the respondent lawyers are entitled to the benefit of it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	493	It is again only when , with all allowances made , a lawyer 's conduct of proceedings is quite plainly unjustifiable that it can be appropriate to make a wasted costs order . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	494	-LRB- emphasis supplied -RRB- The answer given therefore was not to treat the existence of privileged material as an absolute bar to any claim by an opposite party for a wasted costs order but to require the court to take into account the possibility of the existence of such material and to give the lawyers the benefit of every reasonably conceivable doubt that it might raise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	495	So , all that the lawyer has to do is to raise a doubt in the mind of the court whether there might not be privileged material which could affect its decision whether or not to make a wasted costs order and , if so , in what terms and the court must give the lawyer the benefit of that doubt in reaching its decision , including the exercise of its statutory discretion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	496	I see nothing unfair about this approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	497	Further , if the use of the jurisdiction on the application of an opposite party is kept within the proper bounds , the frequency with which the problem arises of taking into account the existence of possibly relevant but unseen privileged material should be much reduced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	498	62 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	499	The contrary submission of the appellants on this appeal treats the existence of privileged material as a kind of trump card which will always preclude the making of a wasted costs order on the application of an opposite party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	500	They ask how can a court evaluate whether privileged material which , ex hypothesi , it has not seen would affect its decision without first seeing that material . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	501	But this argument does not reflect what was said in Ridehalgh . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	502	Once the lawyer is given the benefit of any doubt , any element of unfairness is removed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	503	It must depend upon the circumstances of each particular case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	504	For example , a lawyer who has to ask for an extension of time or an adjournment because , say , he has forgotten about a time-limit or has accidentally left his papers at home , would not be able to say that any privileged material could possibly excuse his incompetent mistake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	505	To make a wasted costs order against him would not -LRB- absent some additional factor -RRB- be inappropriate or unfair . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	506	In other situations privileged material may have a possible relevance and therefore require assumptions favourable to the lawyer to be made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	507	Thus , in the present case it is assumed that in all respects the appellant barristers were acting on the express instructions of their lay clients although a finding of fact to that effect could only be made after the consideration of privileged material . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	508	The assumption removes the unfairness which might otherwise , in this respect , exist . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	509	63 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	510	Therefore , for myself , I would not qualify what was said in Ridehalgh . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	511	But I agree that it may be salutary to remind parties that each case must depend upon its own facts and that the power to make an order is discretionary and material which could affect the exercise of that discretion is also relevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	512	I agree with my noble and learned friend Lord Bingham of Cornhill that the court must be satisfied before it makes the wasted costs order that there is nothing that the lawyer could say , if unconstrained , to resist the order and that it is in all the circumstances fair to make the order . 	lord hobhouse	lord bingham	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	513	The Present Case : 64 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	514	The facts leading up to the making by the Court of Appeal of the wasted costs order against the barristers are fully set out in the Court of Appeal judgments and have been summarised in the Opinion of my noble and learned friend . 	lord hobhouse	lord bingham	partagr	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	515	The difference between the majority and the minority in the Court of Appeal was not in the test to be applied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	516	All agreed that the barristers should be given the benefit of any doubt : see Peter Gibson LJ , -LSB- 2001 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep 146 , at pp. 153 and 157 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	517	The difference lay in the outcome of applying the test . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	518	Thus Peter Gibson LJ said at p. 158 on behalf of himself and Schiemann LJ : `` Try though we might , we have not found it possible to conceive of any circumstances in which the barristers in putting their names to the particular allegations of impropriety in the draft amended notice of appeal and supporting them in their skeleton and at the hearing had relevant privileged or confidential material which justified their conduct as compliant with section 606 but had been withheld from the court . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	519	On the other hand , Wilson J said -LRB- at p. 162 -RRB- : `` I remain in doubt whether on 3 and 4 February the barristers were guilty of professional impropriety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	520	It is doubt of which , pursuant to the same passage in Ridehalgh v Horsefield , they must have the benefit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	521	It is better that in certain circumstances the wasted costs jurisdiction should be emasculated by the principle of legal professional privilege than vice versa . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	522	65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	523	With the one exception of the transcripts allegation , I agree that the preferable view is that the wasted costs order should not have been made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	524	The complaint made on behalf of Mr Medcalf was that an application had been made to the Court of Appeal to allow the amendment of the notice of appeal and for the admission of fresh evidence which included allegations which could not properly be made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	525	The application for a wasted costs order was based upon the draft amended notice and the accompanying skeleton argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	526	These documents were effectively simultaneous although dated one day apart -LRB- 3 and 4 February 2000 -RRB- and they were signed by the barristers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	527	It was a consequence of these documents that additional time was taken up on the first two days -LRB- 14 and 15 February -RRB- at the hearing of the appeal but there was not any additional waste of time caused by counsel taking excessive time to argue Mr Mardell 's case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	528	All the relevant points upon which the applications to amend and admit fresh evidence were based were hopeless and were roundly rejected by the Court of Appeal both at the time and in their unanimous written judgment dismissing the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	529	With the one exception already mentioned , I would put these points into the category of arguing a hopeless case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	530	How they would ever persuade the Court of Appeal to allow the appeal and reverse the judge 's judgment escapes me . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	531	They related to peripheral matters and , although the credibility of Mr Medcalf was central to the judge 's decision and the attempt to upset it on appeal , they could not be thought sufficient , nor were they all novel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	532	Speaking for myself , I would put these points into the category , not of impropriety , but of counsel discharging their duty to present even a hopeless case if instructed to do so , in which case no question of making a wasted costs order against them should have arisen . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	533	It must be remembered that the good faith of the barristers and their consciousness of the rules of their profession are not challenged nor is their statement that they acted upon their clients ' express instructions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	534	If it is considered that the barristers ' inclusion of these points was improper , I would not arrive at that conclusion without feeling doubts which I would not wish to resolve without knowledge of the surrounding circumstances and the privileged material covering the relationship between the advocates and their client . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	535	I do not believe that in these circumstances it would be fair to exercise the discretion against the appellants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	536	The Transcripts Allegation : 66 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	537	This allegation was included in Ground 45 of the proposed amendments to the notice of appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	538	It was in the following terms : `` The First and Fourth Defendants have fresh evidence that since the trial there has been interference with the official transcript of the trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	539	The First and Fourth Defendants have caused a second set of transcripts to be prepared by different transcribers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	540	The first set of transcripts contain alterations , deletions , interpolations , and false certifications tending to the detriment of the First and Fourth Defendants ' already disclosed grounds of appeal and attempting to buttress the learned Judge 's Judgment , obscure perjured testimony and prevent the discovery of additional substantive grounds of appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	541	The said interference casts such fundamental doubt upon the integrity of the plaintiff and the process of the court in this case that a new trial should be ordered ex debito justitiae . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	542	This is an allegation of serious fraud and conspiracy involving not only Mr Medcalf but also the official court transcribers and , presumably , the plaintiffs ' solicitors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	543	The accompanying skeleton argument in 12 paragraphs identified the evidential material relied on , going back to the previous summer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	544	67 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	545	There are three important features which are essential to the proper evaluation of the allegation made in the proposed Ground 45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	546	The appellants ' argument failed to have any regard to them and the same could fairly be said of the dissenting judgment of Wilson J. 68 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	547	The first and most important is that the allegation was made as part of and was dependant upon a Ladd v Marshall -LRB- see -LSB- 1954 -RSB- 1 WLR 1489 -RRB- application to admit fresh evidence in the Court of Appeal on appeal from a final judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	548	The applicant has to identify and place before the Court of Appeal in documentary form the fresh evidence the subject of the application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	549	The fresh evidence to support the relevant ground of appeal has thus to be fully disclosed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	550	There is no room for the applicant to say that if you grant my application to adduce the fresh evidence then there is other evidence not adduced at the trial and not included in my application upon which I will also want to rely . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	551	The application is exhaustive of the opportunity to adduce fresh evidence in the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	552	In any event , the position was put beyond argument by an order of Clarke LJ on 28th January directing that any evidence to be relied on should be served by 4th February . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	553	The evidence placed before the Court of Appeal on behalf of Mr Mardell was the only evidence upon which Mr Mardell could rely in support of Ground 45 and upon which the advocates could rely as justifying the allegation in Ground 45 in compliance with Paragraph 606 of the Code of Conduct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	554	69 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	555	There has been a discussion whether Paragraph 606 is satisfied by an expectation of obtaining admissible evidence which has not yet been obtained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	556	I do not wish to enter upon this discussion save to say that it is misconceived : the emphasis should be upon whether the existing material discloses a prima facie case , which is a concept well understood in many areas of procedural law , not least in the criminal law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	557	The question which the advocate must ask is : is there a prima facie case of the fraud which I am going to allege ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	558	It is important not in any way to devalue the important principle encapsulated in Paragraph 606 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	559	But , in any event the ` expectation ' excuse can not , and could not on any hypothesis , assist the appellants here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	560	At the early stages of litigation , before the close of pleadings , some of the relevant evidence supporting an allegation may not yet have been put into a form which can actually be used at the trial ; discovery may yet have to take place but a party may know what documents will have to be produced on discovery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	561	At the stage of trial , evidence which has not been given and the advocate can not adduce can not be relied upon to justify an allegation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	562	After trial and judgment , the situation is even more clear cut . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	563	Only evidence already adduced in the action or for which leave to adduce is given by the Court of Appeal under Ladd v Marshall can be relied upon as justification . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	564	This was the position here in relation to Ground 45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	565	Ground 45 and the accompanying skeleton argument made allegations which came within the scope of Paragraph 606 and clearly should have been -LRB- and the barristers say it was -RRB- seen as engaging the professional responsibility of an advocate to the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	566	Since the allegations related to matters occurring after trial and judgment , the principle in Ladd v Marshall was inevitably critical to the ability to sustain the allegation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	567	A specific application to admit fresh evidence had to be made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	568	The allegation had to be made on the evidence which Mr Mardell as the appellant was asking the Court of Appeal to admit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	569	If that evidence did not disclose even a prima facie case against Mr Medcalf , it follows that a breach of Paragraph 606 and the advocates ' duty to the court occurred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	570	70 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	571	The second feature is partly a consequence of the first . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	572	It is not possible to make a Ladd v Marshall application without waiving any privilege in the material which is the subject of the application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	573	Ground 45 starts with the words - `` the ... Defendants have fresh evidence that since the trial there has been interference with the official transcripts of the trial '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	574	They can not at the same time claim any privilege against disclosing what that evidence is . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	575	The suggestion that there was material capable of justifying the allegation which Mr Mardell could rely on without waiving any privilege and disclosing the material to the opposite side and the court is patently unsustainable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	576	71 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	577	The third feature is peculiar to the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	578	The allegation of fraudulent interference with the transcript had been unsuccessfully relied upon by junior counsel for Mr Mardell on previous occasions using the same material . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	579	In particular , on 2nd December , she applied to Lloyd J for an order that proceedings on the account should be stayed and the police should be directed to investigate the transcript question as an attempt to pervert the course of justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	580	The judge dismissed the applications and refused leave to appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	581	The reaction of the Court of Appeal on the hearing of the substantive appeal should have come as no surprise to the barristers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	582	It was entirely in line with what had been said by the judge earlier . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	583	There was no evidence whatever that Mr Medcalf or anyone acting for him had anything to do with the defective transcripts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	584	The evidence disclosed regrettably familiar deficiencies in the system whereby mechanical recordings and transcripts are made in the Royal Court of Justice in London . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	585	The primary tape is in the court-room where the trial is taking place and depends upon a court official each day keeping a log of the proceedings and switching the tape on and off at the right times . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	586	The tape recording should be of a reasonably good quality but the transcriber , who has no independent knowledge of the proceedings , is entirely dependant upon what the court officials have done . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	587	-LRB- The court officials may indeed have had to look after several courts at the same time . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	588	What happened in the present case was that the court officials did not keep a complete log and did not always switch on or off the tape recorder at the times they should . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	589	Also , at times the voice on the tape was not clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	590	All this was confirmed by the investigations carried out and the statements and affidavits lodged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	591	In the Royal Courts of Justice there is also a back-up multitrack tape which runs throughout the working day covering all courts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	592	Inevitably its quality is not as good as the primary tape . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	593	A transcript is not made unless asked for . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	594	The transcript will normally be made by one of the Lord Chancellor 's Department contractors from the daily court-room tapes if available . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	595	This was what was done initially in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	596	When the defects in the first transcript and , hence , in the tapes from the court room were discovered and the solicitors complained , the senior contractors were called in and a further complete transcript was made using both types of tape . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	597	This is the second transcript to which Ground 45 refers and which those representing Mr Mardell consider to be satisfactory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	598	72 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	599	It was an unhappy incident but it was fully explored and explained in the evidence which was put before the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	600	In my judgment no competent and reasonably experienced advocate or litigator should have seen anything remotely sinister about it let alone treat it as evidence of a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	601	As previously stated , there was nothing to implicate Mr Medcalf or any one acting for him in any wrong doing in this connection whatever . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	602	It disclosed no prima facie case against him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	603	Yet the advocates put their signature to Ground 45 and to the supporting skeleton argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	604	73 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	605	In my judgment this was just the type of situation Paragraph 606 was designed to prevent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	606	Unjustifiable allegations of fraud have been made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	607	Like Peter Gibson LJ and Schiemann LJ , I can not conceive of any privileged material which could possibly make any difference to the culpability of making this irresponsible allegation or justify it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	608	The allegation is on its face implausible and suggests an abandonment of the objectivity and sense of proportion which a court is entitled to require of an advocate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	609	Further it was the duty of the advocate to put before the court on the Ladd v Marshall application the material which was said to justify the allegation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	610	If the material was not reasonably capable of justifying it , even on a prima facie basis , the allegation should not have been made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn

114	612	Therefore I would for myself only allow the appeal in part . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	613	But your Lordships consider otherwise and would allow the appeal wholly . 	lord hobhouse	all	partdisa	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	614	Since matters of discretion are involved and since I do not feel confident that , if the transcript allegation had stood alone , the Court of Appeal would still have thought that a wasted costs order was appropriate , or at least felt no doubt about it , I will with reluctance concur in the order proposed . 	lord hobhouse	self	outcome	0.9	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn

114	619	75 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn

114	622	76 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	623	Like my noble and learned friend , Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough , I was much troubled by the allegation , in ground 45 of the proposed amendments to the notice of appeal , of fraudulent interference with the transcript . 	lord rodger	lord hobhouse	partagr	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	624	None the less , the appellants have not been able to tell their side of the story . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	625	A court making a wasted costs order under section 51 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 exercises a discretion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	626	All kinds of mitigatory circumstances may be relevant to the exercise of that discretion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	627	In my view , therefore , it was wrong for the Court of Appeal to make an order against the appellants in a situation where the full facts about the circumstances in which the appellants had been instructed and had prepared the relevant documents were not known and where the appellants were prevented from putting them before the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	628	77 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	629	The majority of the Court of Appeal held that the appellants ' conduct , in drafting the amended notice of appeal on 3 February 2000 and in preparing the skeleton arguments the following day , had been `` improper '' in terms of section 51 -LRB- 7 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	630	That decision was based on the view that their conduct on those dates was governed by paragraph 606 of the Code of Conduct of the Bar of England and Wales -LRB- 7th ed -LRB- 2000 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	631	Paragraph 606 provides that , before making any allegation of fraud , counsel should have before him `` reasonably credible material which as it stands establishes a prima facie case of fraud '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	632	The majority held that , in terms of the rule , the `` material '' had to be `` evidence which can be put before the court to make good the allegation '' : -LSB- 2001 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep -LRB- PN -RRB- 146 , 154 , para 40 per Peter Gibson LJ . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	633	Since it was clear from what happened subsequently that no such evidence had been available to counsel on 3 and 4 February , the majority held that counsel had breached the rule in paragraph 606 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	634	78 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	635	The interpretation of the paragraph 606 that the majority adopted is , perhaps , not surprising since the rule of professional conduct was formerly understood to be to that effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	636	For instance , in Associated Leisure Ltd -LRB- Phonographic Equipment Co Ltd -RRB- v Associate Newspapers Ltd -LSB- 1970 -RSB- 2 QB 450 , 456E - F Lord Denning MR indicated his understanding that the duty of counsel was not to put a charge of fraud on the record `` unless he has clear and sufficient evidence to support it . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	637	The passage is cited in Bullen & Leake & Jacob 's Precedents of Pleadings 13th ed -LRB- 1990 -RRB- , p 428 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	638	The same approach is to be found in the extrajudicial remark of Lord Macmillan that , where a person 's reputation is at stake , the pleader should not `` trespass ... a hair 's breadth beyond what the facts as laid before him and duly vouched and tested , will justify '' : `` The Ethics of Advocacy '' in Law and Other Things -LRB- 1937 -RRB- , p 192 , approved in Oldfield v Keogh -LRB- 1941 -RRB- 41 SR -LRB- NSW -RRB- 206 , 211 per Jordan CJ . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	639	79 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	640	But the current rule is that stated in paragraph 606 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	641	Wilson J held that the term `` material '' in paragraph 606 went wider than evidence in proper form : -LSB- 2001 -RSB- Lloyd 's Rep -LRB- PN -RRB- 146 , 161 para 80 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	642	The paragraph states a rule of professional conduct rather than a rule of law , but I agree with his interpretation of it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	643	The current rule of conduct is slightly less strict than the rule as at one time understood . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	644	While , usually , the material before counsel will comprise evidence in an admissible form , something less can satisfy the requirements of the current rule , provided that it establishes a prima facie case of fraud . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	645	A report of an official inquiry , or accurate reports of evidence given in a civil or criminal trial , are examples that come to mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	646	A professional rule that permits counsel to draft pleadings on such a basis , before the actual evidence is to hand , achieves a sensible balance : it gives due protection to defendants , while not putting unnecessary obstacles in the way of claimants and their counsel raising proceedings promptly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
114	647	So interpreting the rule , I am unable to infer from the circumstances that the appellants were necessarily in breach of it on 3 or 4 February 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord rodger, lord steyn
