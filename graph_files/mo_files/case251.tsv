251	7	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	8	As the number of reported cases on the topic makes clear , similar fact evidence has proved a contentious and uncertain area of the law , particularly in criminal cases but also in civil cases like that before the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	9	But such evidence may be very important , even decisive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	10	It is undesirable that the subject should be shrouded in mystery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	11	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	12	Any evidence , to be admissible , must be relevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	13	Contested trials last long enough as it is without spending time on evidence which is irrelevant and can not affect the outcome . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	14	Relevance must , and can only , be judged by reference to the issue which the court -LRB- whether judge or jury -RRB- is called upon to decide . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	15	As Lord Simon of Glaisdale observed in Director of Public Prosecutions v Kilbourne -LSB- 1973 -RSB- AC 729 , 756 , `` Evidence is relevant if it is logically probative or disprobative of some matter which requires proof ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	16	. relevant -LRB- ie . logically probative or disprobative -RRB- evidence is evidence which makes the matter which requires proof more or less probable '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	17	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	18	That evidence of what happened on an earlier occasion may make the occurrence of what happened on the occasion in question more or less probable can scarcely be denied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	19	If an accident investigator , an insurance assessor , a doctor or a consulting engineer were called in to ascertain the cause of a disputed recent event , any of them would , as a matter of course , enquire into the background history so far as it appeared to be relevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	20	And if those engaged in the recent event had in the past been involved in events of an apparently similar character , attention would be paid to those earlier events as perhaps throwing light on and helping to explain the event which is the subject of the current enquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	21	To regard evidence of such earlier events as potentially probative is a process of thought which an entirely rational , objective and fair-minded person might , depending on the facts , follow . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	22	If such a person would , or might , attach importance to evidence such as this , it would require good reasons to deny a judicial decision-maker the opportunity to consider it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	23	For while there is a need for some special rules to protect the integrity of judicial decision-making on matters of fact , such as the burden and standard of proof , it is on the whole undesirable that the process of judicial decision-making on issues of fact should diverge more than it need from the process followed by rational , objective and fair-minded people called upon to decide questions of fact in other contexts where reaching the right answer matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	24	Thus in a civil case such as this the question of admissibility turns , and turns only , on whether the evidence which it is sought to adduce , assuming it -LRB- provisionally -RRB- to be true , is in Lord Simon 's sense probative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	25	If so , the evidence is legally admissible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	26	That is the first stage of the enquiry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	27	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	28	The second stage of the enquiry requires the case management judge or the trial judge to make what will often be a very difficult and sometimes a finely balanced judgment : whether evidence or some of it -LRB- and if so which parts of it -RRB- , which ex hypothesi is legally admissible , should be admitted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	29	For the party seeking admission , the argument will always be that justice requires the evidence to be admitted ; if it is excluded , a wrong result may be reached . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	30	In some cases , as in the present , the argument will be fortified by reference to wider considerations : the public interest in exposing official misfeasance and protecting the integrity of the criminal trial process ; vindication of reputation ; the public righting of public wrongs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	31	These are important considerations to which weight must be given . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	32	But even without them , the importance of doing justice in the particular case is a factor the judge will always respect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	33	The strength of the argument for admitting the evidence will always depend primarily on the judge 's assessment of the potential significance of the evidence , assuming it to be true , in the context of the case as a whole . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	34	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	35	While the argument against admitting evidence found to be legally admissible will necessarily depend on the particular case , some objections are likely to recur . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	36	First , it is likely to be said that admission of the evidence will distort the trial and distract the attention of the decision-maker by focusing attention on issues collateral to the issue to be decided . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	37	This is an argument which has long exercised the courts -LRB- see Metropolitan Asylum District Managers v Hill -LRB- 1882 -RRB- 47 LT 29 , 31 per Lord O'Hagan -RRB- and it is often a potent argument , particularly where trial is by jury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	38	Secondly , and again particularly when the trial is by jury , it will be necessary to weigh the potential probative value of the evidence against its potential for causing unfair prejudice : unless the former is judged to outweigh the latter by a considerable margin , the evidence is likely to be excluded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	39	Thirdly , stress will be laid on the burden which admission would lay on the resisting party : the burden in time , cost and personnel resources , very considerable in a case such as this , of giving disclosure ; the lengthening of the trial , with the increased cost and stress inevitably involved ; the potential prejudice to witnesses called upon to recall matters long closed , or thought to be closed ; the loss of documentation ; the fading of recollections . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	40	It is , I think , recognition of these problems which has prompted courts in the past to resist the admission of such evidence , sometimes -LRB- as , perhaps , in R v Boardman -LSB- 1975 -RSB- AC 421 -RRB- propounding somewhat unprincipled tests for its admission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	41	But the present case vividly illustrates how real these burdens may be . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	42	In deciding whether evidence in a given case should be admitted the judge 's overriding purpose will be to promote the ends of justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	43	But the judge must always bear in mind that justice requires not only that the right answer be given but also that it be achieved by a trial process which is fair to all parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	44	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	45	His Honour Judge Graham Jones and the Court of Appeal were in my opinion right to regard the evidence which Mr O'Brien seeks to adduce as potentially probative , and so admissible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	46	Mr O'Brien contends that , in the course of investigating the murder of Mr Saunders and prosecuting him and his co-defendants for that murder , named officers for whom the Chief Constable is responsible resorted to specific methods which were oppressive , dishonest and unprofessional . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	47	Accusations of such gravity must be clearly proved , and proof could never be easy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	48	The primary evidence must relate to how Mr O'Brien and his co-defendants were treated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	49	But if he were able to show that these same officers had , in the earlier cases of Griffiths and Ali , resorted to the same or similar methods in order to try and obtain admissions and convictions , his hand would be significantly strengthened : put technically , the matter which requires proof would be more probable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	50	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	51	The judge reviewed the evidence and considered that it should be admitted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	52	In the absence of misdirection or demonstrable error that is not a judgment with which an appellate court should interfere , and the Court of Appeal was right not to do so save in a very limited way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	53	Both courts , in my respectful view , reviewed the competing arguments in a careful and judicious way , and I do not think their conclusions can be faulted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	54	I would add only this : that while , for purposes of pleading and disclosure , it was desirable and perhaps necessary to obtain a proleptic ruling in principle on the admission of this evidence , the final say , in relation to any particular item of evidence , should rest with the trial judge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	55	That judge will recognise the need to be loyal to the ruling already made , but the ultimate responsibility for ensuring a fair trial and a just outcome rests with him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	56	The trial judge can not be deprived of all discretion , although the discretion should be exercised consistently with the ruling made by Judge Graham Jones and approved on appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips

251	65	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	66	Introduction 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	67	This appeal requires your Lordships to consider the circumstances in which evidence of ` similar facts ' can be admitted in a civil suit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	68	Under English common law , in both criminal and civil proceedings that were not disposed of in summary fashion , the functions of the trial used to be shared between judge and jury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	69	The judge was responsible for resolving issues of law , the jury issues of fact . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	70	This division of functions enabled the judge to control the evidence that was placed before the jury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	71	The principles under which he exercised what must initially have been a discretion in relation to this control became over time , by the process of the common law , recognised as rules of law governing ` admissibility ' , a concept that I believe to be foreign to most civil law jurisdictions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	72	In time Parliament intervened to codify , and sometimes to vary , the principles of admissibility applied by the judges . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	73	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	74	For obvious reasons evidence has never been admissible if it has not been relevant to the issues arising in the proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	75	Rules of admissibility govern the circumstances in which evidence which is relevant is not admitted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	76	Two policy considerations underlie the rules of admissibility with which this appeal is concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	77	First , evidence should not be admitted if it is likely to give rise to irrational prejudice which outweighs the probative effect that the evidence has in logic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	78	This consideration of policy carries particular weight where the tribunal is a jury , whose members are not experienced as are judges in putting aside irrational prejudice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	79	Secondly , evidence should not be admitted if its probative weight is insufficient to justify the complexity that it will add to the trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	80	That is a consideration of general application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	81	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	82	The evidence whose admissibility is in issue on this appeal is known as ` similar facts ' evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	83	Issues in relation to such evidence normally arise in criminal rather than civil proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	84	Where a defendant to a criminal charge has a criminal record , his propensity to commit crime will normally have some relevance to the question of whether he committed the offence with which he is charged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	85	As a general rule such evidence has none the less been held to be inadmissible on the ground that its prejudicial effect is likely to outweigh its probative value . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	86	Exceptions have , however , been made to this general exclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	87	The nature and extent of those exceptions have proved a frequent preoccupation of the appellate courts and , on at least four occasions , of your Lordships ' House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	88	They are now to be found codified in sections 101 to 106 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 -LRB- ` the 2003 Act ' -RRB- , which were brought into effect in December last year . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	89	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	90	Not infrequently a defendant in a criminal trial makes allegations of misconduct on the part of police witnesses in relation to the circumstances in which alleged admissions have been obtained , or the accuracy of those admissions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	91	The defendant may wish to adduce ` similar fact ' evidence designed to show that the police witness has been guilty of similar misconduct in the past . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	92	Once again the courts have restricted the circumstances in which such evidence can be adduced by a defendant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	93	Those restrictions are now codified in section 100 of the 2003 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	94	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	95	On this appeal the issue of the admissibility of similar fact evidence arises in the context , not of a criminal prosecution , but of a civil suit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	96	The claimant , Michael O'Brien , is suing the Chief Constable of South Wales Police for misfeasance in public office and malicious prosecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	97	In 1988 Mr O'Brien was convicted of murder . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	98	He served 11 years of his life sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	99	His case was then referred to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission and his appeal was allowed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	100	Mr O'Brien alleges that he was , in common parlance , ` framed ' by the police for a murder which he never committed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	101	He identifies as primarily responsible a Detective Inspector Lewis but alleges that his superior officer , Detective Chief Superintendent Carsley , gave express or tacit approval to at least some aspects of the misconduct alleged against DI Lewis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	102	Mr O'Brien gave notice of his intention to adduce evidence designed to demonstrate that DCS Carsley had behaved with similar impropriety on one other occasion and that DI Lewis had done so on two other occasions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	103	At the Case Management Conference the admissibility of this evidence was challenged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	104	His Honour Judge Graham Jones ruled that it was admissible , but that he had a discretion to exclude it as a matter of case management . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	105	He declined to exclude it , with the exception of one incident alleged against DI Lewis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	106	On appeal the Court of Appeal held that the judge 's ruling on admissibility had been correct , as had the exercise of his discretion in not excluding the evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	107	The court held , however , that he should also have admitted the evidence of the incident that the judge had excluded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	108	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	109	The case advanced on behalf of the Chief Constable is that there is a rule of law which prevents the admission of similar fact evidence in a civil trial unless it has an enhanced probative value . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	110	Whether there is such a rule and , if so , the degree to which the probative value must be enhanced before the evidence becomes admissible are the issues of law raised by this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips

NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	141	Improper pressure took the form of bullying and verbal abuse both during and between interviews , physical discomfort , threats made in respect of family , pressure to implicate co-detainees in return for leniency ; attempts to prompt and/or put words into his mouth ; denial of access to a solicitor ; attempts to induce him to be interviewed without a solicitor after one had been contacted ; attempts to upset and discomfort him emotionally , for example by references to homosexuality ; -LRB- iii -RRB- Officers fabricated admissions during formal interviews and ` verbals ' outside such interviews .

251	163	Counsel for each of the parties spent a considerable time exploring before the House the cogency of the similar fact evidence and the extent to which this provided support for Mr O'Brien 's case as to the manner in which he and his co-defendants were treated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	164	This exercise could only be material should your Lordships be persuaded that the Court of Appeal applied too lenient a test of admissibility and that it was appropriate for this House to apply the correct test to the material facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	165	In so far as the result in the Court of Appeal turned on a review of the exercise of discretion by the trial judge , I do not believe that your Lordships would be minded to conduct a further review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	166	The test applied by the Court of Appeal and the challenge to this 24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	167	The Court of Appeal held that , in civil as opposed to criminal proceedings , the judge has to proceed in two stages when deciding whether to admit evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	168	First he has to decide whether the evidence is admissible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	169	If it is , he has to decide , as a matter of discretion whether he will permit the evidence to be led . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	170	The test of admissibility is that propounded by your Lordships ' House in Director of Public Prosecutions v P -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 2 AC 447 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	171	The exercise of discretion as to whether admissible evidence should be permitted to be led involves the approach that the judge should bring to case management in accordance with the Civil Procedure Rules -LRB- CPR -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	172	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	173	The Court of Appeal thus applied to the test of admissibility in civil proceedings the approach adopted in criminal proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	174	Mr Freeland QC for the appellant also relied extensively on jurisprudence in the criminal field . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	175	His primary submission was largely founded , however , on the decision of this House in a civil appeal , Metropolitan Asylum District Managers v Hill -LRB- 1882 -RRB- 47 LT 29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	176	That decision , he submitted , supported the proposition that similar fact evidence was not admissible unless likely to be ` reasonably conclusive ' of a primary issue in the proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	177	Mr Freeland 's alternative case was that , to be admissible , similar fact evidence had to have enhanced relevance , so as to be of substantial probative value . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	178	This was the test for admission of evidence of bad character by the defence in a criminal trial recommended by the Law Commission in their Report on Evidence of Bad Character in Criminal Proceedings -LRB- Law Com No 273 -RRB- of October 2001 -LRB- Cm 5257 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	179	The criminal cases 26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	180	The criminal courts have always applied a general rule that evidence that an accused has committed criminal offences other than those with which he is charged is inadmissible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	181	This rule was explained by counsel for the appellants in Makin v Attorney General for New South Wales -LSB- 1894 -RSB- AC 57 as being justified , not because the evidence was wholly irrelevant , but because it was ` inconvenient and dangerous ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	182	Such evidence would tend ` both to confuse and unduly to prejudice the jury ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	183	In that case the appellants were convicted of murdering an infant that they had received for adoption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	184	They complained , unsuccessfully , that evidence had been admitted of the discovery , buried in their garden , of the bodies of five other children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	185	In explaining why this evidence was admissible , Lord Herschell LC said , at p 65 : `` It is undoubtedly not competent for the prosecution to adduce evidence tending to shew that the accused has been guilty of criminal acts other than those covered by the indictment , for the purpose of leading to the conclusion that the accused is a person likely from his criminal conduct or character to have committed the offence for which he is being tried . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	186	On the other hand , the mere fact that the evidence adduced tends to shew the commission of other crimes does not render it inadmissible if it be relevant to an issue before the jury , and it may be so relevant if it bears upon the question whether the acts alleged to constitute the crime charged in the indictment were designed or accidental , or to rebut a defence which would otherwise be open to the accused . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	187	The statement of these general principles is easy , but it is obvious that it may often be very difficult to draw the line and to decide whether a particular piece of evidence is on the one side or the other . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	188	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	189	For nearly 100 years this passage was repeatedly cited by courts to justify the admission of similar fact evidence , notwithstanding that , as pointed out by Mr L H Hoffmann , the author of Similar Facts after Boardman -LRB- 1975 -RRB- 91 LQR 193 at p 200 , `` the Makin rule affords no real guidance on whether similar fact evidence is admissible or not '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	190	In reality , judges tended to let in similar fact evidence , and appeal courts to approve their doing so , when , as a matter of logic , the evidence pointed cogently to the conclusion that the accused had committed the offence with which he was charged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	191	In R v Boardman -LSB- 1975 -RSB- AC 421 your Lordships ' House tried once again to explain the principles governing the admission of evidence of past conduct by an accused similar to the conduct with which he was charged - in that case , acts of buggery by a schoolmaster with boys in which the accused was the passive partner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	192	Their Lordships expressed the test in different ways : `` a really material bearing on the issues to be decided '' per Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest at p 439 ; `` a strong degree of probative force '' based on the `` striking similarity '' of the material facts per Lord Wilberforce at p 444 ; `` such an underlying unity between the offences as to make coincidence an affront to common sense '' per Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone at p 453 , quoting Lord Simon of Glaisdale in R v Kilbourne -LSB- 1973 -RSB- AC 729 , 759 ; `` evidence which would point so strongly to his guilt that only an ultra-cautious jury , if they accepted it as true , would acquit in face of it '' per Lord Cross of Chelsea at p 457 ; `` the similarity would have to be so unique or striking that common sense makes it inexplicable on the basis of coincidence '' per Lord Salmon at p 462 .

251	193	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	194	Mr Hoffmann , in his article , saw this decision as ' a great advance ' in that it recognised that the admissibility of similar fact evidence depended ` simply and solely upon its probative strength ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	195	It is clear , however , that the probative strength had to be substantial , before the evidence became admissible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	196	If it was not it would be excluded because its prejudicial effect on the accused risked being greater than its relevance justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	197	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	198	Some of the language in Boardman suggested that the probative strength of similar fact evidence had to be very high indeed before it could be admitted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	199	This led , in some instances , to the exclusion of evidence that was of considerable probative weight . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	200	An example of this was the decision of the Court of Appeal in DPP v P -LRB- 1990 -RRB- 93 Cr App R 267 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	201	The defendant was charged with a number of specimen counts of rape and incest against each of his two daughters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	202	The trial judge refused an application that there should be separate trials in respect of the offences alleged against each daughter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	203	The defendant was convicted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	204	The Court of Appeal allowed his appeal and quashed the conviction on the ground that the judge had erred in refusing separate trials . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	205	Lord Lane CJ held that the court had looked in vain for features of similarity that was striking or that went beyond `` the incestuous father 's ` stock in trade ' '' that were considered necessary if the evidence of offences against one daughter was to be admissible in relation to the offences alleged against the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips

251	207	The prosecution appealed to this House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	208	The certified question of law asked whether there had to be ` striking similarities ' before similar fact evidence could be admitted in a case of alleged sexual abuse by a father of a daughter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	209	Lord Mackay of Clashfern LC , who gave a speech with which the other members of the House agreed , advanced principles which , thereafter , were rightly treated by courts as being of general application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	210	After considering at length the speeches in Boardman he propounded at p 460 a simple test of admissibility : `` From all that was said by the House in Reg v Boardman I would deduce the essential feature of evidence which is to be admitted is that its probative force in support of the allegation that an accused person committed a crime is sufficiently great to make it just to admit the evidence , notwithstanding that it is prejudicial to the accused in tending to show that he was guilty of another crime . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	211	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	212	Lord Mackay went on to say that while such probative force may be derived from the striking similarity of the similar fact evidence this was not a precondition of admissibility , pp 460-461 : `` Once the principle is recognised , that what has to be assessed is the probative force of the evidence in question , the infinite variety of circumstances in which the question arises , demonstrates that there is no single manner in which this can be achieved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	213	Whether the evidence has sufficient probative value to outweigh its prejudicial effect must in each case be a question of degree . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	214	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	215	The test of admissibility advanced by Lord Mackay in DPP v P still requires similar fact evidence to have an enhanced relevance or substantial probative value before it is admissible against a defendant in a criminal trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	216	This is because such evidence usually shows that the defendant is a person of bad character and thus risks prejudicing a jury against the defendant in a manner that English law regards as unfair . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	217	Instead of applying Lord Mackay 's simple test , a trial judge now has to apply his mind to the matters set out in sections 101 to 106 of the 2003 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	218	These preserve , however , by rules of some complexity , the requirement that the similar fact evidence should have an enhanced probative value . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	219	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	220	It is not obvious that the test in DPP v P was one that it was appropriate for the Court of Appeal to apply in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	221	Here there is no defendant at risk of conviction of a criminal offence rendering him liable to imprisonment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	222	The claimant was so convicted and he wishes to use similar fact evidence against the police who he alleges improperly procured his conviction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	223	There is a much closer parallel between this situation and that where , in the course of a criminal trial , a defendant seeks to establish that evidence given against him by police witnesses is untruthful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips

251	227	The evidence against him included police evidence that he had made confessions in interview . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	228	The appellant had challenged the veracity of the interview notes , alleging that the police officers concerned had ` fitted him up ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips

251	232	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	233	Lord Lane started his consideration of the law at p 214 with the following proposition : `` The test is primarily one of relevance , and this is so whether one is considering evidence in chief or questions in cross-examination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips

251	239	After citation of a case dealing with cross-examination as to credit Lord Lane continued , at p 219 : `` The distinction between the issue in the case and matters collateral to the issue is often difficult to draw , but it is of considerable importance .

251	240	Where cross-examination is directed at collateral issues such as the credibility of the witness , as a rule the answers of the witness are final and evidence to contradict them will not be permitted : see Lawrence J in Harris v Tippett -LRB- 1811 -RRB- 2 Camp 637 , 638 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips

251	242	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	243	Lord Lane then referred to exceptions to the rule that evidence to contradict answers on cross-examination as to credit will not be permitted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	244	One such exception was that evidence could be introduced to show that a witness was `` biased or partial in relation to the parties or the cause '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	245	Lord Lane then considered the existence of a further possible exception : evidence to show `` that the police are prepared to go to improper lengths to secure a conviction '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	246	He held that such evidence could only be introduced if relevant to an allegation of bias . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips

251	248	Lord Lane remarked that the appeal before the court raised two problems , first , what questions could properly be asked in cross-examination , and secondly , whether evidence to contradict the answers would have been admissible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	249	He went on to deal with the first question , drawing a line between complaints of misconduct , upon which there had not been adjudication , and disciplinary charges found proved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	250	Questions in cross-examination could be asked about the latter , but not about the former . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	251	Lord Lane then turned to the question , particularly relevant in the present context , of evidence that suggested that the testimony of a police witness appeared to have been disbelieved in a previous trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	252	After consideration of authority , Lord Lane summarised the position as follows , at p 217 : `` The acquittal of a defendant in case A , where the prosecution case depended largely or entirely upon the evidence of a police officer , does not normally render that officer liable to cross-examination as to credit in case B . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	253	But where a police officer who has allegedly fabricated an admission in case B , has also given evidence of an admission in case A , where there was an acquittal by virtue of which his evidence is demonstrated to have been disbelieved , it is proper that the jury in case B should be made aware of that fact . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	254	However , where the acquittal in case A does not necessarily indicate that the jury disbelieved the officer , such cross-examination should not be allowed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	255	In such a case the verdict of not guilty may mean no more than that the jury entertained some doubt about the prosecution case , not necessarily that they believed any witness was lying . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	256	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	257	After referring to two previous cases that exemplified the above proposition , Lord Lane turned to the question of whether , if the facts put in cross-examination were denied , evidence could be led to counter such denial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	258	At p 220 he concluded that it could not : `` In our judgment this questioning would have been as to credit alone , that is to say , on a collateral issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	259	It would not have fallen within any exception to the general rule . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	260	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	261	This conclusion reflects , I believe , `` the necessity of keeping the criminal process within proper bounds and avoiding the pursuit of side issues which are only of marginal relevance to the jury 's decision '' , to which Lord Lane had earlier referred at p 219 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	262	It is not , however satisfactory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	263	Evidence which indicates that a police officer has fabricated admissions in a previous case is not evidence ` as to credit alone ' , if it is alleged that the same officer has fabricated evidence in a subsequent case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	264	The position is now governed by section 100 of the 2003 Act which renders admissible , with the leave of the court , evidence of the bad character of a person other than the defendant if , and only if , it has substantial probative value in relation to a matter which is in issue in the proceedings and is of substantial importance in the context of the case as a whole .

251	265	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	266	The Court of Appeal in the present case dismissed an argument by Mr Freeland that the judge should have applied the approach laid down in Edwards on the ground that `` this line of authority , which is concerned with the exertion of disciplinary control over questioning in a criminal trial that goes only to credit -LRB- so that rebutting evidence can not be adduced -RRB- , is of no assistance in determining what evidence is admissible in a civil claim of the type with which we are at present concerned , where the issue to be determined is quite different . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	267	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	268	I have reservations about this conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	269	The issue in both Edwards and the present case is the admissibility of evidence to prove police misconduct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	270	In each case , there is a need to exert disciplinary control to avoid unbalancing the proceedings by the adducing of evidence of only marginal relevance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	271	This appeal raises the question of whether a rule of admissibility , such as that now to be found in section 100 of the 2003 Act , should apply in civil proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	272	It is time to turn to the authorities that deal with similar fact evidence in the civil context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	273	The civil cases 44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	274	Metropolitan Asylum District Managers v Hill 47 LT 29 involved an action for nuisance brought by the owners of land adjacent to a smallpox hospital in Hampstead against the managers of the hospital . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	275	Their case appears to have included an averment that a smallpox hospital was a nuisance per se because , even if the hospital had been managed with due care , the disease of those within would escape to infect those living in the vicinity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	276	The action was tried by a jury and the answers that the jury gave to the questions left to them led the judge to rule that the hospital was a nuisance per se . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	277	On appeal a new trial was ordered , on terms as to costs , on the ground that the jury 's findings had been against the weight of the evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	278	The issue before this House was whether this order was properly made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	279	A side issue was , however , canvassed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	280	The plaintiffs had sought to adduce statistical evidence of the incidence of smallpox in the vicinity of two other smallpox hospitals , in an attempt to demonstrate that this was greater than in areas where there was no such hospital . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	281	Lord Selborne LC commented at p 30 that if evidence could be given of similar facts from which the effect , or absence of effect , of other hospitals on the surrounding neighbourhoods could either positively or approximately be ascertained , it would be admissible and material . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	282	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	283	Lord O'Hagan and Lord Blackburn were both concerned at the effect that the admission of such evidence might have on keeping trials at Nisi Prius within a practicable and manageable compass , and envisaged that it might be open to the judge to refuse to admit it for this reason . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	284	Lord Watson declined to rule on the admissibility of the evidence in question , but made the following general observations at p 35 : `` Still , there appears to me to be an appreciable distinction between evidence having a direct relation to the principal question in dispute and evidence relating to collateral facts , which will , if established , tend to elucidate that question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	285	It is the right of the party tendering it to have evidence of the former kind admitted , irrespective of its amount or weight , these remaining for consideration when his case is closed ; but I am not prepared to hold that he has the same absolute right when he tenders evidence of facts collateral to the main issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	286	In order to entitle him to give such evidence , he must , in the first instance , satisfy the court that the collateral fact which he proposes to prove will , when established , be capable of affording a reasonable presumption or inference as to the matter in dispute ; and I am disposed to hold that he is also bound to satisfy the court that the evidence which he is prepared to adduce will be reasonably conclusive , and will not raise a difficult and doubtful controversy of precisely the same kind as that which the jury have to determine . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	287	It appears to me that it might lead to unfortunate results if the court had not the power to reject evidence of collateral fact which does not satisfy both of the conditions which I have endeavoured to indicate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	288	If it be the right of a litigant to offer just as much or as little testimony as he thinks fit in support of an alleged collateral fact , which would admittedly be useful if proved , then it must be his right to submit to the jury any number of issues precisely similar to that which they are empanelled to try , and to support these by proof far more unsatisfactory than the evidence bearing directly upon the leading issue .

251	289	46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	290	Mr Freeland submitted that this passage from Lord Watson 's speech supported the proposition that similar fact evidence is not admissible unless it is likely to be reasonably conclusive of the issue to which it relates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	291	I believe that he misinterpreted the passage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	292	Lord Watson was expressing the opinion that evidence of collateral facts should not be admitted unless the evidence was likely to be reasonably conclusive of the collateral facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	293	The collateral facts themselves had merely to raise a ` reasonable presumption or inference ' as to the matter in dispute to which they were said to be relevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	294	More to the point , it seems to me that Lord Watson was contemplating that the trial judge would have a discretion to shut out evidence of collateral facts in the interests of keeping the trial manageable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips

251	297	I propose to jump nearly 100 years to an observation of Lord Denning MR in Mood Music Publishing Co Ltd v De Wolfe Ltd -LSB- 1976 -RSB- Ch 119 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	298	This was a breach of copyright case involving music and the issue was whether the judge had properly admitted similar fact evidence showing that the defendants had published music resembling material protected by copyright in the past .

251	299	The defendants urged that the approach of this House in Boardman should be applied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	300	Lord Denning held at p 127 : `` The admissibility of evidence as to ` similar facts ' has been much considered in the criminal law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips

251	333	The test of admissibility of similar facts against a defendant in criminal proceedings , as propounded in DPP v P and in the 2003 Act , requires an enhanced relevance or substantial probative value because , if the evidence is not cogent , the prejudice that it will cause to the defendant may render the proceedings unfair .

251	376	It had regard to the difficulty facing a claimant in Mr O'Brien 's position in establishing his account on the basis of his word against that of a number of police officers , and to the impact that the similar fact evidence could have in assisting him to overcome that difficulty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	377	Finally the court commented that the evidence was of malpractice that , if proved , struck at the heart of the administration of a fair system of criminal justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips

251	387	63 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	388	I also agree that , since there is no demonstrable error in the approach adopted in the courts below , it would not be appropriate for the House to differ from the conclusions which they have reached that the similar fact evidence should be admitted . 	lord rodger	all	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	389	I am bound to say , however , that in the case of R v Ali the alleged connexion of Mr Lewis with the supposed misconduct in interviewing Mr Ali is somewhat indirect and , if exercising the initial judgment myself , I would have been inclined to exclude that evidence on the ground that its potential significance would not justify the time and expense of exploring it at the trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	390	64 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	391	The probative value of the evidence relating to R v Griffiths is more readily apparent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	392	None the less , as the hearing of the appeal went on and counsel for both parties explained the issues and counter-issues which would be explored , it seemed to me that there was a considerable risk that they would add very greatly indeed to the length of the trial and might even come to dominate it .

251	394	Therefore , while I see no sound basis for interfering with the decision of the Court of Appeal , I should not wish the decision in this case to be seen as authority for the view that there may not be sound reasons in case management terms for excluding or limiting similar fact evidence which is likely to be as extensive as the evidence in this case . 	lord rodger	self	outcome	0.8	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips

251	401	67 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	402	A significant part of the difficulty which has been found in articulating with proper clarity the rules governing the admission of similar fact evidence has arisen from the failure to appreciate the need to preserve a sufficiently clear distinction between criminal and civil cases and between the two stages of the juridical process of consideration of the admission of evidence of similar facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	403	68 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	404	It is helpful in any consideration of the topic to keep distinct these two stages , as there has been a tendency in many of the decided cases to elide them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	405	The first stage is common to both criminal and civil cases , the requirement that the evidence which it is proposed to adduce is relevant to one or more issues in the trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	406	The second stage is the application of the control test , which is different in civil cases from that which is applied in criminal trials . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	407	In the latter the second stage is commonly incorporated with the first to make a composite rule of law , but they do nevertheless reflect distinct reasoning processes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	408	69 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	409	The test in the first stage is that of relevance , whether the evidence is logically probative or disprobative of some matter which requires proof : Director of Public Prosecutions v Kilbourne -LSB- 1973 -RSB- AC 729 , 756 , per Lord Simon of Glaisdale . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	410	On this issue I respectfully agree with what Lord Bingham of Cornhill has said in para 4 of his opinion . 	lord carswell	lord bingham	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	411	The matters which require proof in the context of the present appeal are that Detective Inspector Lewis committed the acts alleged against him in the pleadings and that Detective Chief Superintendent Carsley knew of irregular behaviour in the investigation and failed to take any action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	412	70 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	413	Mr Freeland QC for the appellant submitted that the test of relevance which I have set out should be expressed in more stringent terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	414	He propounded a number of suggested limitations , which may be summarised as follows : -LRB- i -RRB- mere propensity to behave in the manner alleged in the material averments is insufficient ; -LRB- ii -RRB- isolated examples of alleged misconduct in other cases are insufficient ; -LRB- iii -RRB- evidence of similar facts must , in order to be admissible , be highly or strongly probative of an issue in the substantive case ; an alternative mode of expressing this is that it must have enhanced relevance ; -LRB- iv -RRB- the probative strength of the allegation which the party seeks to adduce as evidence of similar facts , and hence its admissibility , will be affected by the extent to which that allegation is a proven fact : complex , unsubstantiated allegations will not generally suffice and the evidence should be reasonably conclusive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	415	71 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	416	In some of the cases the two stages may have been elided and the control mechanism imported from the second stage into the test of relevance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	417	It was suggested by the appellant 's counsel that the decision in Metropolitan Asylum District Managers v Hill -LRB- 1882 -RRB- 47 LT 29 supported the proposition that similar fact evidence was not admissible unless it was reasonably conclusive of the issue to which it related . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	418	For the reasons given by Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers in para 46 of his opinion I think that the passage from Lord Watson 's speech on which counsel relied has been misinterpreted and that it means only that the collateral facts should be established by reasonably conclusive proof , which relates rather to Mr Freeland 's fourth proposed limitation . 	lord carswell	lord phillips	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	419	It is right to say , however , that the two stages in considering the admission of similar fact evidence are not kept clearly distinct in the speeches either of Lord Watson or Lord O'Hagan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	420	In the same way , the speeches of their Lordships in R v Boardman -LSB- 1975 -RSB- AC 421 do not maintain a distinction between the stages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	421	This is understandable in a criminal case , where in the second stage the probative force of the similar fact evidence has to be balanced against the degree of prejudice to which it may give rise , so that this rather than pure relevance is the important issue for decision and the tests are commonly compressed into a single principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	422	72 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	423	In my opinion the correct approach is to keep the stages separate and to reject the more stringent tests of relevance as a condition of admissibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	424	This proposition is borne out by modern authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	425	Lord Denning MR expressed it in Mood Music Publishing Co Ltd v De Wolfe Ltd -LSB- 1976 -RSB- Ch 119 , 127 in a passage which clearly expressed the correct approach : `` The admissibility of evidence as to ` similar facts ' has been much considered in the criminal law ... The criminal courts have been very careful not to admit such evidence unless its probative value is so strong that it should be received in the interests of justice : and its admission will not operate unfairly to the accused . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	426	In civil cases the courts have followed a similar line but have not been so chary of admitting it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	427	In civil cases the courts will admit evidence of similar facts if it is logically probative , that is , if it is logically relevant in determining the matter which is in issue : provided that it is not oppressive or unfair to the other side : and also that the other side has fair notice of it and is able to deal with it . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	428	73 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	429	I do not myself find it helpful to dismiss certain types of similar fact evidence by giving them the pejorative label of evidence of `` mere propensity '' or `` disposition '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	430	As my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn pointed out in R v Randall -LSB- 2004 -RSB- 1 WLR 56 , at para 26 : `` It is no answer to admitting -LSB- similar fact -RSB- evidence that it is evidence of the propensity of the accused to commit certain crimes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	431	On the contrary , that is often the very reason for admitting such evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	432	While these rules are not applicable in this case their rationale illustrates that propensity to commit certain crimes may sometimes be relevant to the fact in issue . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	433	A case in point is R v Straffen -LSB- 1952 -RSB- 2 QB 911 , in which the similar fact evidence could be described as evidence of pure propensity to commit crimes similar to that with which he was charged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	434	The probative strength of the evidence may be a material factor in balancing the factors in the second stage of the process , not only in criminal trials , but in civil cases , as the Court of Appeal pointed out in para 71 of its judgment in the present case ; cf L H Hoffmann , -LRB- 1975 -RRB- 91 LQR 193 , 205 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	435	It should be kept firmly in mind , however , that it is not such a factor in the first stage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	436	74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	437	Mr Freeland sought to draw support for his second proposed limitation , that isolated examples of similar facts will not suffice , from the speech of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in R v Boardman -LSB- 1975 -RSB- AC 421 , 439 , where he said that , to be admissible , evidence must be related to something more than isolated instances of the same kind of offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	438	This statement was in the context of a criminal case , in which , as I have said , the probative strength of the similar fact evidence is a material factor in considering the second stage of the test of admissibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	439	Even then one must keep in mind the observations of Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough in R v Z -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 2 AC 483 , 508 : `` Similar facts are admissible because they are relevant to the proof of the defendant 's guilt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	440	The evidence relating to one incident taken in isolation may be unconvincing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	441	It may depend upon a straight conflict of evidence between two people . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	442	It may leave open seemingly plausible explanations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	443	The guilt of the defendant may not be proved beyond reasonable doubt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	444	But , when evidence is given of a number of similar incidents , the position may be changed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	445	The evidence of the defendant 's guilt may become overwhelming . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	446	The fact that a number of witnesses come forward and without collusion give a similar account of the defendant 's behaviour may give credit to the evidence of each of them and discredit the denials of the defendant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	447	Evidence of system may negative a defence of accident . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	448	This is the simple truth upon which similar fact evidence is admitted : it has probative value and is not merely prejudicial . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	449	A parallel may be seen with circumstantial evidence , which Pollock CB in R v Exall -LRB- 1866 -RRB- 4 F & F 922 at 929 compared to a rope comprised of several cords . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	450	He went on to say : `` One strand of the cord might be insufficient to sustain the weight , but three stranded together may be quite of sufficient strength . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	451	Thus it may be in circumstantial evidence - there may be a combination of circumstances , no one of which would raise a reasonable conviction , or more than a mere suspicion : but the whole taken together , may create a strong conclusion of guilt , that is , with as much certainty as human affairs can require or admit of . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	452	75 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	453	The limitation which Mr Freeland propounded with most vigour was his third , that the similar fact evidence must have enhanced relevance , that is to say , it must be strongly probative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	454	Again he called in aid statements of Lord Wilberforce , at p 444 and Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone , at p 454 of R v Boardman -LSB- 1975 -RSB- AC 421 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	455	Again , however , it has to be borne in mind that they were considering the test in criminal cases : see the observations of Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers at para 33 of his opinion in the present appeal . 	lord carswell	lord phillips	partagr	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	456	There is no good reason in principle to require that evidence of similar facts in civil cases must , to be admissible , be strongly probative or have enhanced relevance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	457	Nor is there in my opinion any authority which supports such a proposition , for the cases cited on behalf of the appellant , when properly analysed , do not bear it out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	458	On the contrary , the clear statement of Lord Denning MR in the Mood Music case is firmly against it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	459	I accordingly agree with the conclusion expressed by Lord Bingham of Cornhill in para 4 of his opinion , that in the first stage of the enquiry admissibility turns only on whether the evidence proposed to be adduced is probative . 	lord carswell	lord bingham	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	460	In a criminal trial , as Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers pointed out in para 52 of his opinion , it may be necessary to look for enhanced relevance or substantial probative value , for that may be necessary to offset the degree of prejudice caused , but that is a matter for the second stage . 	lord carswell	lord phillips	partagr	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	461	76 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	462	The appellant 's fourth suggested requirement , that evidence of the allegations proposed to be adduced as similar facts will be admitted only if they are proven facts , is in my view wrong both in principle and on authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	463	It is refuted by the analysis which I have quoted of Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough in R v Z of the cumulative strength which may be built up from a number of relatively frail strands . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	464	It is inconsistent with the remark of Lord Mackay of Clashfern LC in R v H -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 2 AC 596 , 605 that the judge is not to be held to have accepted that the evidence is true . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	465	It is also inherent in the decision in Director of Public Prosecutions v P -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 2 AC 447 that the allegation was unproven , as both incidents in that case were the subject of the trial of the defendant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	466	Moreover , section 109 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 expressly recognises that the truth of the allegation may not have been formally established . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	467	The strength of the allegations , which may be evidenced by their having been established as proven facts , may come into the scales in the second stage , but it is not necessary in the first stage to require that they be so proven . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	468	77 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	469	When the court has decided that the evidence proposed to be adduced as similar facts is logically probative of the matter or matters in the substantive case to which it is desired to relate it , then it must in the second stage of the exercise consider the limiting or control factors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	470	I fully agree with Lord Bingham of Cornhill 's description of these factors in paras 5 and 6 of his opinion and do not wish to add more than a couple of thoughts . 	lord carswell	lord bingham	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	471	First , I would not accept the appellant 's submission -- which may be said to relate to both stages -- that the two sets of allegations must be so similar that coincidence can effectively be ruled out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	472	Secondly , the lengthening of the trial and increase of costs to which the calling of similar fact evidence will give rise must not be disproportionate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	473	Thirdly , the application of the principles governing the limiting factors may differ according to whether the mode of trial is with a jury or by a judge alone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	474	78 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	475	His Honour Judge Graham Jones , sitting as a judge of the High Court , in a thorough and careful judgment reviewed the matters proposed to be adduced as similar facts and concluded that the aspects of the evidence which he listed were relevant as being probative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	476	The Court of Appeal agreed with these conclusions , but also added the further matter which was the subject of the cross-appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	477	I consider that all these matters satisfied the test appropriate to the first stage and that the decision of the Court of Appeal was plainly right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	478	It was urged upon the House by the appellant 's counsel that the evidence against DCS Carsley was too flimsy to be allowed in , but that will be a matter of proof : if established on the evidence , the allegations are relevant and potentially admissible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	479	79 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	480	The judge went on to make an exercise of his discretion in accordance with the factors material to the second stage , which he correctly identified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	481	The Court of Appeal upheld the exercise of that discretion in respect of the allegations in the Ali case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	482	In respect of the Griffiths case the Court of Appeal considered that the judge had under-estimated the potential lengthening of the trial if the allegations made in that case were adduced as similar fact evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	483	It accordingly proceeded to exercise its discretion afresh and , having done so , reached the same conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	484	I see no ground on which to interfere with the conclusions of the judge or the Court of Appeal , both of whom expressed the principles correctly and gave proper consideration to the issues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	485	80 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
251	486	I would therefore affirm the decision of the Court of Appeal and dismiss the appeal . 	lord carswell	self	outcome	1	lord bingham, lord carswell, lord phillips
