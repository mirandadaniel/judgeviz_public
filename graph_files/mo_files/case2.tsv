2	15	"My Lords , "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	16	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	17	This appeal is about the right of the European citizen to watch his national football team on television . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	18	"More particularly , it concerns the duty of the United Kingdom under European law to refuse to allow a UK television company to exercise exclusive rights to broadcast live coverage of Denmark 's World Cup matches on the ground that too few Danes would be able to watch them . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	19	Pay-TV and free-to-air TV 4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	20	"The background to the European legislation on the subject is the advent , over the last 15 years or so , of television broadcasts by cable or satellite , generally known as `` pay-TV '' , which can be received only by subscribers to the service . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	21	"In order to persuade people to pay to watch television , it is necessary to offer them programmes which would not be available for free on ordinary public broadcasts -LRB- `` free-to-air '' television -RRB- . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	22	The most effective attractions are recent feature films and popular sporting events . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	23	So the growth of pay-TV has largely depended upon its ability to acquire the exclusive rights to films and sports broadcasts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	24	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	25	"Until the appearance of pay-TV , competition in Europe for the rights to live television broadcasts of sporting events was not particularly vigorous . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	26	Most national free-to-air broadcasters belonged to a buying cartel called Eurovision which bargained collectively for the rights to events of international interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	27	National free-to-air broadcasters often negotiated jointly or collectively for the rights to events of national interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	28	The fees paid to sports organisers were correspondingly low . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	29	Competition from pay-TV for exclusive rights drove up prices to unprecedented levels . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	30	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	31	The competition was greatly to the benefit of the sports organisers and players . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	32	But there was alarm in a number of member states at the prospect that pay-TV broadcasters might be able to outbid the national free-to-air broadcasters for sporting events like the Grand National or the Tour de France which virtually the entire nation was used to watching on free-to-air television every year . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	33	"The possibility that anyone who did not subscribe to pay-TV might be deprived of the opportunity to watch such events resulted in political pressure which led , first , to domestic legislation in the United Kingdom and then to a European Directive on the subject . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	34	The UK domestic system 7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	35	This is contained in Part IV of the Broadcasting Act 1996 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	36	"Section 97 gives the Secretary of State for Culture , Media and Sport the power to draw up a list of sporting or other events of national interest . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	37	"The current list includes the Olympic Games , the Grand National , the Wimbledon Finals , cricket Test matches played in England and Six Nations Rugby matches in which a home country is playing . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	38	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	39	"By section 99 , a term in a contract granting rights to televise a listed event is void so far as it purports to preclude the grant of similar rights to another broadcaster . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	40	A sports organiser can not therefore contractually bind itself to grant exclusive rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	41	But this provision does not actually require the sports organiser to grant such rights to more than one broadcaster and it would often be in its economic interest not to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	42	Section 98 can not therefore ensure that a listed event is shown on free-to-air television . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
2	43	The mechanism by which Parliament has attempted to achieve this result lies in other provisions of Part IV . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	44	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	45	"Section 98 divides broadcasters into two categories , roughly corresponding to pay-TV and free-to-air . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	46	"The vital section is 101 , which provides that a broadcaster in one category may not without the consent of the Independent Television Commission -LRB- `` the ITC '' -RRB- broadcast a listed event unless it is also broadcast by one in the other category . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	47	The practical effect of this provision is that a pay-TV broadcaster who wishes to broadcast a listed event on a de facto exclusive basis has to obtain the consent of the ITC . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	48	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	49	"Section 104 -LRB- 1 -RRB- requires the ITC to draw up a code of guidance which , among other things , gives guidance as to the matters which it will take into account in determining whether or not to give consent under section 101 and section 104 -LRB- 2 -RRB- requires the ITC in exercising their powers to have regard to the provisions of the code . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	50	I shall in due course come back to some of these provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	51	The European Directive 11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	52	Similar anxieties in other member states about the accessibility of sporting events of national interest led to the adoption of a Directive on the subject . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	53	"This was 97/36/EC , adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on 30 June 1997 . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	54	"It inserted into the Directive which harmonises a number of aspects of the regulation of television broadcasting -LRB- 89/552/EEC , generally known as the Television Without Frontiers Directive -RRB- , a new Article 3a : `` 1 . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	55	Each member state may take measures in accordance with Community law to ensure that broadcasters under its jurisdiction do not broadcast on an exclusive basis events which are regarded by that member state as being of major importance for society in such a way as to deprive a substantial proportion of the public in that member state of the possibility of following such events via live coverage or deferred coverage on free television . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	56	"If it does so , the member state concerned shall draw up a list of designated events , national or non-national , which it considers to be of major importance for society . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	57	"... In so doing the member state concerned shall also determine whether these events should be available via whole or partial live coverage , or where necessary or appropriate for objective reasons in the public interest , whole or partial deferred coverage . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	58	`` 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	59	Member states shall immediately notify to the Commission any measures taken or to be taken pursuant to paragraph 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	60	"Within a period of three months from the notification , the Commission shall verify that such measures are compatible with Community law and communicate them to the other member states ... . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	61	`` 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	62	"Member states shall ensure , by appropriate means , within the framework of their legislation that broadcasters under their jurisdiction do not exercise the exclusive rights purchased by those broadcasters following the date of publication of this Directive in such a way that a substantial proportion of the public in another member state is deprived of the possibility of following events which are designated by that other member state in accordance with the preceding paragraphs via whole or partial live coverage or , where necessary or appropriate for objective reasons in the public interest , whole or partial deferred coverage on free television as determined by that other member state in accordance with paragraph 1 . '' "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	63	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	64	It will be seen that paragraph 1 gave member states a power to legislate to protect the dissemination of what they regarded as events of major importance for their societies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	65	Four have taken advantage of this power . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	66	"Italy , has designated the Formula One Italian Grand Prix , and the San Remo music festival and some other events . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	67	Germany has designated various football competitions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	68	Denmark 's designated events include World Cup football matches in which Denmark is playing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	69	"The United Kingdom , as we have seen , had anticipated the Directive and simply notified the terms of Part IV together with the ITC code of guidance and the Secretary of State 's list of events . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	70	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
2	71	"Paragraph 3 , on the other hand , imposes a duty upon every member state to ensure `` by appropriate means '' that its own broadcasters do not exercise an exclusive right to televise an event designated by another member state in such a way that a substantial proportion of its public of the possibility of watching . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	72	"To enable the UK to comply with this duty , the Secretary of State amended Part IV by regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972 : the Television Broadcasting Regulations 2000 . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	73	"He inserted a new section 101B which requires the consent of the ITC to the exclusive broadcasting of events designated by other member states , analogous to the consent required under section 101 : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- A television programme provider shall not , without the previous consent of the Commission , exercise rights to televise the whole or part of an event which is a designated event , in relation to an EEA state other than the United Kingdom , for reception in that EEA state or any area of that EEA state , where a substantial proportion of the public in that EEA state is deprived of the possibility of following that event by live or deferred coverage on free television as determined by that state in accordance with article 3a -LRB- 1 -RRB- of Council Directive 89/552/EEC . '' "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	74	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	75	Section 101B does not of course constitute compliance with Article 3a -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	76	Whether we comply or not depends upon how the ITC exercises its power to give consent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	77	The power is therefore by no means unfettered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	78	"As a matter of European law , it must be exercised so as to ensure that we comply with the Directive . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	79	The bidding for the Danish World Cup qualifying matches . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	80	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	81	"The issue has arisen because on 5 June 2000 a UK broadcaster called TVDanmark 1 -LRB- `` TVD '' -RRB- entered into a contract with UFA Sports GmbH -LRB- `` UFA '' -RRB- , which distributes television rights for World Cup football matches , for the exclusive right to televise five qualifying matches for the 2002 World Cup in which Denmark was playing away . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	82	These were designated events under the Danish legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	83	"TVD is a new entrant to the market , having commenced business on 1 January 2000 . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	84	"It is based in the UK , but transmits programmes to Denmark by cable and satellite . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	85	"Although its subscription charge is low enough for it to count under Danish law as a `` free-to-air '' broadcaster , it is at present available to only about 60 % of the Danish public , which is insufficient to satisfy the Danish criterion for not preventing a substantial proportion of the public from watching . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	86	TVD therefore required consent under section 101B . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	87	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	88	UFA formed its own opinion of the market value of the exclusive rights and offered them simultaneously to a number of Danish broadcasters including two -LRB- DR and TV2 -RRB- which satisfied the criteria for free public broadcasting . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	89	Everyone was treated equally and had a fair opportunity to bid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	90	DR and TV2 made a joint bid but offered only 60 % of what UFA regarded as the fair price . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	91	"TVD also offered less , but substantially more than the public broadcasters . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	92	UFA said that they would rather have sold the rights to broadcasters who could reach the larger audience . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	93	But they owed a duty to their principals to obtain a reasonable market price . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	94	The ITC code 17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	95	"When section 101B was added by regulation to the 1996 Act , the regulations also required the ITC to include guidance in its code as to the matters which it would take into account in determining whether to grant consent under that section . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	96	"It did so by saying that the criteria and matters it would take into account would be `` similar to '' those which it took into account under section 101 : see paragraph 26 of the ITC Code on Sports and other Listed Events , revised January 2000 . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	97	It is therefore necessary to look at some of the guidance given in relation to domestic listed events . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	98	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	99	In paragraph 9 the ITC emphasised that the Act did not guarantee that a listed event would be broadcast on a free-to-air service . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
2	100	Nor did it prohibit de facto exclusive rights being exercised by pay-TV broadcasters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	101	The question was whether the ITC was satisfied that its criteria had been met . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	102	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	103	The most important of these criteria are set out in paragraph 13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	104	I quote some relevant passages : `` 13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	105	"In deciding whether to give its consent it may be sufficient for the ITC to establish that the availability of the rights was generally known and no broadcaster providing a service in the other category had expressed an interest in their acquisition to the rights holder , or had not bid for the rights . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	106	"However , the ITC will wish to be satisfied that broadcasters have had a genuine opportunity to acquire the rights on fair and reasonable terms and , in reaching a view , will take account of some or all of the following criteria : - any invitation to express interest , whether in the form of public advertisement or closed tender , in the acquisition of the rights must have been communicated openly and simultaneously to broadcasters providing services in both categories . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	107	"- the price sought for the rights must have been fair , reasonable and non-discriminatory as between the two categories of programme service . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	108	What is a fair price will depend upon the rights being offered and the value of those rights to broadcasters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	109	"A wide range of prices is likely to be regarded as fair but when required to make its own judgment on the matter the ITC will have regard to , inter alia : - previous fees for the event or similar events ; - time of day for live coverage of the event ; - the revenue or audience potential associated with the live transmission of the event -LRB- eg the opportunity to sell advertising and sponsorship ; the prospects for subscription income -RRB- ; - the period for which rights are offered ; and - competition in the market place . '' "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	110	The ITC decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	111	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	112	The ITC was satisfied that the auction process had complied with its criteria as to fairness and transparency . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	113	It was also minded to consider that the price paid for the exclusive rights was fair and reasonable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	114	"But it first consulted with the Danish Ministry of Culture , which administers the Danish system for the protection of listed events and with the Danish Competition Council . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	115	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	116	"The Danish system , although designed to secure the same objective as the UK system , is in some respects different . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	117	The relevant Ministerial Order of 19 November 1998 provides in general terms that exclusive rights to designated events shall not be used in such a way that a substantial proportion of the population is prevented from following them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	118	A coverage of 90 % is necessary to satisfy this criterion -LRB- in the UK it is 95 % -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	119	Section 5.1 provides that a broadcaster who has acquired exclusive rights may exercise them only if it is able to make arrangements to ensure 90 % coverage through other broadcasters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	120	"But , by section 5.2 , it need not do so if it can demonstrate that no broadcasters satisfying the criteria were `` prepared to enter into an agreement on reasonable market terms '' . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	121	Section 5.3 provides a mechanism for testing whether the other broadcasters are prepared to enter into such agreements or not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	122	"They must express an interest within 14 days after receiving a written offer of an agreement to take part in arrangements in accordance with section 5.1 , giving various particulars including the requested price . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	123	"If there is a dispute over whether the price is reasonable , the matter may be referred by the parties or a `` judicial or administrative authority '' for the opinion of the Competition Council . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	124	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	125	The Danish system therefore contemplates that a non-qualifying broadcaster who has acquired exclusive rights to a designated event must be prepared to share them with other broadcasters willing to acquire non-exclusive rights at a reasonable price . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	126	"No doubt , in the interests of certainty , broadcasters contemplating the acquisition of such exclusive rights will want to ascertain in advance whether they are likely to have to share them . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	127	"In the last resort , however , they may have to resort to a formal offer to satisfy the regulator that they are at liberty to exercise their rights on an exclusive basis . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
2	128	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	129	The Danish response to the ITC consultation was to say that the public broadcasters DR and TV2 had never been asked whether they would be willing to share the rights with TVD . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	130	All that they had been offered was the right to bid for the rights on an exclusive basis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	131	"In the absence of an offer of shared rights , the Danish Ministry of Culture considered that TVD would be exercising its rights contrary to the terms of article 3a -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Directive . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	132	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	133	The ITC asked TVD whether it would be willing to make an offer of non-exclusive participation to DR and TV2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	134	TVD said that it would not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	135	"It was seeking consent from the UK , not the Danish regulator . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	136	"The UK system , as expressed in sections 101 , 101B and the code , was to have regard only to the circumstances in which the broadcaster seeking consent had acquired its rights . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	137	"If TVD had acquired them in fair competition at a reasonable price , it was entitled to consent . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	138	It could not be required to give competing public broadcasters a second chance by an offer of non-exclusive rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	139	The code contained no suggestion that such a condition might be imposed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	140	"As the whole value of the rights to TVD lay in their exclusivity , a requirement that it should grant non-exclusive rights to DR and TV2 meant that it might as well not have bought them in the first place . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	141	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	142	The ITC decided to refuse consent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	143	"In a letter dated 17 August 2000 it said that whatever might be the breadth of its discretion under section 101 , it was obliged to exercise its discretion under section 101B in conformity with the Directive . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	144	It accepted that it should have regard to the code but this did not mean that it could thereby bind itself to decide in a way which would be contrary to European law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	145	It was not satisfied that allowing TVD to exercise exclusive rights would not prevent a substantial proportion of the Danish public from watching the matches . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	146	This was because it was not satisfied that the public broadcasters had had : `` a genuine opportunity to acquire rights -LSB- sc non-exclusive rights -RSB- on fair and reasonable terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	147	In the present case the Commission does not accept that it was sufficient that the rights were originally awarded in a tender process as described in your letters . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	148	Judicial review 26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	149	TVD applied for judicial review to quash the ITC 's decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	150	"The main ground upon which it alleged that the ITC had acted unlawfully was that under the UK system , no account could be taken of what TVD did or did not do after it had acquired the rights . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	151	"The only question , as indicated by paragraph 13 of the code , was whether they had been acquired in fair competition at a reasonable price . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	152	"As the ITC appeared to be satisfied on this point , it should have granted consent . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	153	"A second ground was that TVD had a legitimate expectation , based on the code , that it would receive consent if it acquired its rights on fair and reasonable terms . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	154	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	155	"The application came before Mr Jack Beatson QC , sitting as a deputy High Court judge . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
2	156	He rejected the submission that the ITC could not have regard to whether TVD was willing to share the rights after it had acquired them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	157	The Directive was concerned with the `` exercise '' of exclusive rights in such a way that a substantial proportion of the public was deprived of the possibility of following a listed event . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	158	Of course it might be that the reason why the public was deprived of that possibility was not the way the broadcaster was exercising its rights but the fact that no public broadcaster had been willing to acquire any rights on reasonable terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	159	But that causal question had to be asked as at the moment of broadcast and could not in principle exclude from consideration everything which had or had not happened since acquisition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	160	The ITC could have decided that there had been compliance with the Directive but they were also entitled to hold the contrary view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	161	The discretion under section 101B had therefore been lawfully exercised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	162	The judge decided that TVD could not have had a legitimate expectation that the ITC would exercise its discretion in a manner contrary to the terms of the Directive and that it had done enough to put TVD on notice that the absence of an offer to share the rights would be taken into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	163	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	164	"The Court of Appeal -LRB- Kennedy , Waller and Jonathan Parker LJJ -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 1 WLR 74 reversed the judge 's decision . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	165	The court 's reasoning appears to have been made up of three elements . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	166	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	167	"First , they pointed out that the Directive was binding upon member states `` as to the result to be achieved '' but left the national authorities the `` choice of form and methods '' : see article 249 of the EC Treaty . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	168	The object of article 3a -LRB- 3 -RRB- was to prevent exclusive rights from being exercised so as to deprive a substantial proportion of the public of the possibility of watching designated events . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	169	But they said that this was not an unqualified object . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	170	"Recitals to the Directive indicated that it was also intended to promote competition , prevent broadcasting authorities from achieving dominant positions and allow free movement of services . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	171	The United Kingdom was therefore entitled to implement the Directive with due regard to these objects as well . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	172	A free market in sports rights was promoted by a system which had regard solely to the way in which exclusive rights had been acquired -LRB- `` regulation at the point of acquisition '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	173	"This was the correct interpretation of the code and the ITC was not entitled to have regard to post-acquisition matters : see Kennedy LJ at p 83 , Waller LJ at p 84 and Jonathan Parker LJ at p 85 . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	174	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	175	"Secondly , the code allows a free market . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	176	"If a broadcaster has had the opportunity to bid for exclusive rights at a fairly conducted auction and lost , the ITC is bound to be satisfied that he has had the opportunity to acquire the rights on reasonable terms . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	177	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	178	"Thirdly , once there has been a fair auction , it can not be said that a substantial proportion of the public has been deprived of the possibility of watching . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	179	The auction provided such a possibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	180	The appeal 32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	181	The ITC appeals to your Lordships ' House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	182	"The Secretary of State for Culture , Media and Sport petitioned for leave to intervene on the grounds that the Court of Appeal had misinterpreted article 3a -LRB- 3 -RRB- and exposed the United Kingdom to an action by Denmark or the Commission in the European Court of Justice . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	183	Your Lordships heard submissions from counsel on behalf of the Secretary of State in support of the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
2	184	The BBC and ITV also petitioned for leave to intervene in order to submit that the Court of Appeal 's views on the importance of a free market had also misinterpreted the domestic regime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	185	Your Lordships received written representations on behalf of the two networks . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	186	Construction of the Directive 33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	187	In my opinion the result which article 3a -LRB- 3 -RRB- requires member states to achieve is perfectly clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	188	It is to prevent the exercise by broadcasters of exclusive rights in such a way that a substantial proportion of the public in another member state is deprived of the possibility of following a designated event . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	189	"The obligation to achieve that result is in no way qualified by considerations of competition , free market economics , sanctity of contract and so forth . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	190	The fact that reference is made to these matters in the recitals to the Directive explains why the scope of article 3a is limited in the way it is . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	191	Its terms represent a compromise between the policies in question and the interests of the general public in being able to watch sporting events for free . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	192	Member states are limited in the sporting or other events they may reserve for their public broadcasters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	193	Only those of `` major importance for society '' can qualify . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	194	"Premier League football matches , for example , are subject to a free market . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	195	"Furthermore , national measures enacted pursuant to Article 3a -LRB- 1 -RRB- must be approved by the Commission under paragraph 2 as `` compatible with Community law '' . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	196	So the balance between the interests of sports organisers and pay-TV broadcasters in maintaining a free market and the perceived interest of the citizen in being able to watch important sporting events has already been struck in the terms in which article 3a has been framed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	197	It should not be revisited in deciding how a member state should comply with its obligations under article 3a -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	198	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	199	The question which article 3a leaves for the decision of a member state is whether exclusive rights are in fact being exercised in such a way as to deprive the public of the possibility of watching . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	200	They are not being so exercised if the public would not have had that possibility anyway . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	201	This is the decision which section 101B leaves to the judgment of the ITC and I shall return in a moment to what seem to me the relevant considerations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	202	"But section 101B does not , as I have said , give effect in itself to our obligations under article 3a -LRB- 3 -RRB- . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	203	It enables the ITC to do so by conferring a discretion which the ITC must exercise to achieve the result required by the Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	204	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	205	The argument that the public is given the possibility of watching the event if the public broadcasters are given the possibility of buying the rights at a fair auction is in my opinion wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	206	The Directive requires the public to have the possibility of following the event in the sense that a member of the public may watch it if he chooses to switch on his television set . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	207	"If the match is not being shown on any programme to which he has access , he does not have that possibility . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	208	"The reason may or may not be the way in which the party who has acquired exclusive rights is exercising them , but that is a different question . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	209	The free market 36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	210	The Court of Appeal appear to have been influenced by their view that in domestic cases the ITC 's criteria as stated in the code for giving consent under section 101 was to require no more than a fair auction in which the public broadcasters had a reasonable opportunity to bid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	211	"In my opinion , that is an over-simplification . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	212	"Indeed , if that were the beginning and end of the matter , Part IV of the 1996 Act would serve very little purpose and Parliament might as well have left the allocation of listed sporting events to market forces in the same way as Premier League matches . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
2	213	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	214	It is true that paragraph 13 of the code contemplates a process of bidding for de facto exclusive rights and lays down criteria for the fairness of the bidding process . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	215	But the ITC also makes it clear that it will have to be satisfied that the public broadcasters had the opportunity to acquire the rights on `` fair and reasonable terms . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	216	It can be said that the market price for the rights is what they will fetch on the open market and prima facie an opportunity to buy at the market price is an opportunity to buy at fair and reasonable terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	217	"But this principle , if generally applied , would , as I have said , make the whole regulatory machinery in Part IV fairly pointless . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	218	"The code makes it clear that the ITC will form a view of the value of the rights `` to the broadcasters , '' in other words , what that category of broadcasters could reasonably be expected to pay for them . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	219	Of course the ITC may consider that the answer should be the same for both categories ; the public broadcasters are not without resources and market power and the ITC may take the view that the rights in question should simply be left to fair and open competition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	220	"But the clear purpose of Part IV is , if necessary , to protect the public interest in free access to important sporting events against market forces . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	221	"The ITC is engaged in a delicate balance of the interests of broadcasters , sports organisers and the general public . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	222	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	223	The code has to be read in the context of the regulatory scheme created by Part IV and in my opinion it does not necessarily require the ITC to give consent to a broadcaster who has bid highest in a free and open competition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	224	Nor does it give rise to a legitimate expectation that in such circumstances consent will be given . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	225	Exercise and acquistion 39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	226	The Court of Appeal -LRB- adopting Mr Carr 's terminology -RRB- contrasted regulation of sports television rights at the `` point of acquisition '' with regulation at the `` point of exercise '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	227	The former was said to be the UK system and the latter the European system for which the ITC was contending . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	228	But the contrast between the two systems seems to me to have been greatly exaggerated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	229	Both Part IV and the Directive are concerned with the exercise of exclusive rights to designated events . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	230	Section 101 provides that a broadcaster in one category shall not `` include in -LSB- its -RSB- service live coverage of the whole or any part of a listed event '' on a de facto exclusive basis without the consent of the ITC . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	231	"Section 101B , echoing the Directive , provides that a broadcaster shall not `` exercise rights to televise the whole or part of an event which is a designated event '' without the consent of the ITC . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	232	So the statutory result to be achieved is the same . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	233	It is true that the code says that the ITC will ordinarily make its decision under section 101 by reference to the terms on which the rights were acquired . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	234	"But once it is recognised that this does not necessarily require the ITC to accept the outcome of an auction as a fair price , there seem to me no hard and fast line which limits the matters which the ITC can take into account in deciding whether the price offered to the public broadcasters was fair or not . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	235	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	236	"Likewise , it seems to me that the Court of Appeal overstated the uncertainties of `` regulation at the point of exercise '' . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	237	"Kennedy LJ , for example , said that it would mean that a public broadcaster could require to be given a second -LRB- or third -RRB- chance to acquire the rights at any time before the broadcast : -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 1 WLR 74 , 83 . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	238	"The holder of the right would not know whether he could spent money on advertising , would be uncertain as to whether he could recover the price he had paid and so on . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	239	"All this seems to suppose that unless one altogether excludes from consideration anything which happens after the rights have been acquired , the system is bound to operate in a thoroughly unreasonable way . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	240	But this is not the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
2	241	"The Danish system , for example , enables a pay-TV broadcaster who has acquired exclusive rights to obtain within 14 days an answer as to whether the public broadcasters are interested or not . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	242	And one suspects that in practice broadcasters `` design around '' these formal steps in order to achieve certainty at an even earlier stage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	243	"It may be , as the Court of Appeal suggested , that a regulatory system in which a pay-TV broadcaster has to offer to share the rights with a public broadcaster means that any event which the latter wishes to broadcast will be unattractive to the pay-TV broadcaster and that the value of the rights will be depressed . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	244	But that is a consequence which inevitably follows from the protection which the Directive was intended to confer upon the public right of access to such events . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	245	The Danish factor 41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	246	"The decision as to whether article 3a -LRB- 3 -RRB- requires that a UK broadcaster should not be allowed to exercise exclusive rights to broadcast an event designated by another member state is , by virtue of section 101B , a matter for the ITC . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	247	It is not bound by the decision which the regulator in the other member state would have made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	248	"The words `` as determined by that other member state in accordance with paragraph 1 '' at the end of article 3a -LRB- 3 -RRB- refer only to the matters which paragraph 1 says are for the determination of the member state , namely designated events and the question of whether the events should be available via whole or partial live coverage or whole or partial deferred coverage . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	249	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	250	The ITC 's view was that it would accept the Danish law on these matters and also on the question of what amounted to a substantial proportion of the public . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	251	Otherwise the decision was a matter for them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	252	That seems to me correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	253	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	254	The ITC also rejected the suggestion of the Danish Ministry of Culture in a letter of 20 July 2000 that it should have no regard to the terms upon which TVD had acquired its rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	255	In my view that too was correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	256	It is true that article 3a -LRB- 3 -RRB- speaks of exclusive rights `` purchased ... following the date of publication of this Directive '' by the broadcasters and it was suggested that the article only operates once the rights have been purchased . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	257	Of course they have to be purchased in order to be exercised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	258	But that does not mean that the circumstances in which they were purchased are irrelevant to whether they are being exercised `` in such a way '' as to deprive the public of the possibility of watching the event . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	259	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	260	"On the other hand , the ITC obviously paid considerable regard to the fact that under the Danish system of regulation , a non-qualifying broadcaster is required to offer to share the rights with public broadcasters who can offer sufficient coverage . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	261	"Again , this seems to me to be right . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	262	"The system of reciprocal enforcement created by article 3a requires that regulation should as far as possible be harmonised , so that the rights of the public to watch an event of national importance in a member state should not be affected by whether the broadcaster is in that or another member state . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	263	I say `` as far as possible '' because the ITC also has to have regard to the interests of UK broadcasters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	264	But the regulatory system of each member state has to be approved by the Commission under article 3a -LRB- 2 -RRB- and one would therefore not expect its application to be an unreasonable restriction on the rights of broadcasters in other member states . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	265	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	266	"Any broadcaster in any member state who is considering the purchase of exclusive rights to broadcast in Denmark an event designated under Danish law must , as it seems to me , take into account the Danish system of regulation . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	267	That system of regulation will influence the market for such rights in Denmark and prima facie it seems to me right that broadcasters in other member states should have to play by the same rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	268	That was in my opinion the object which article 3a -LRB- 3 -RRB- was intended to achieve . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
2	269	The ITC and Mr Jack Beatson QC correctly interpreted it in that way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
2	270	"In addition , the ITC is entitled to consider that the foreign regulator or arbitral body , such as the Danish Competition Council , acquainted as it is with its national market in television rights , will be best placed to form a view on whether its public broadcasters have refused a reasonable offer at a reasonable price . "	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
2	271	I would therefore allow the appeal and dismiss TVD 's application for judicial review . 	lord hoffmann	self	outcome	1	lord hoffmann
