149	5	In January 1999 Penelope Wilson borrowed # 5,000 from a pawnbroker for a period of six months . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	6	The pawned property was her car , a BMW 318 Convertible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	7	She did not repay the loan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	8	The pawnbroker sought repayment , failing which the car would be sold . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	9	Mrs Wilson 's response was to commence proceedings in the Kingston upon Thames County Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	10	She claimed the agreement was unenforceable because it did not contain all the prescribed terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	11	She sought on order for the return of her car . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	12	Alternatively she sought to reopen the agreement as grossly exorbitant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	13	At the trial Mrs Wilson appeared in person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	14	The pawnbroker was a two-man company , First County Trust Ltd. . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	15	The company was represented in court by its finance director . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	16	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	17	From these modest beginnings the County Court proceedings burgeoned into a case with wide-ranging implications . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	18	Neither Mrs Wilson nor First County Trust appeared before the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	19	But the Attorney General appeared on behalf of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	20	The Speaker of the House of Commons and the Clerk of the Parliaments intervened . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	21	They were represented by leading and junior counsel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	22	The Finance and Leasing Association also intervened , as did four insurance companies which are among the largest providers of motor insurance in this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	23	And leading and junior counsel also appeared as amicus curi ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	24	The # 250 fee : was it ` credit ' ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	25	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	26	When Mrs Wilson signed her agreement and pawn receipt she was charged a ` document fee ' of # 250 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	27	This was added to the amount of her loan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	28	In the agreement the amount of the loan was stated as # 5,250 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	29	The amount payable on redemption was # 7,327 , made up of # 5,250 and interest of # 1,827 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	30	The annual percentage rate of interest was stated to be 94.78 % . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	31	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	32	The agreement was a regulated agreement for the purposes of section 8 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	33	A regulated agreement is not properly executed unless the document signed contains all the prescribed terms : section 61 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	34	One of the prescribed terms is the ` amount of the credit ' : see the Consumer Credit -LRB- Agreements -RRB- Regulations 1983 -LRB- SI 1983/1553 -RRB- , regulation 6 and Schedule 6 , para 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	35	The consequence of failure to state all the prescribed terms of the agreement is that the court is precluded , by section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- , from enforcing the agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	36	In the absence of enforcement by the court the agreement is altogether unenforceable : section 65 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	37	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	38	On 24 September 1999 His Honour Judge Hull QC , in a carefully reasoned judgment , held that the fee of # 250 was part of the amount of the credit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	39	So the agreement was enforceable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	40	He reopened the agreement as an extortionate credit bargain and reduced the amount of interest payable by one half . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	41	Mrs Wilson appealed to the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	42	Pending the hearing of her appeal she paid First County Trust # 6,900 to redeem her car . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	43	That was in December 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	44	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	45	The appeal was heard in November 2000 , shortly after the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	46	The Court of Appeal , comprising Sir Andrew Morritt V-C , and Chadwick and Rix LJJ , allowed Mrs Wilson 's appeal : see -LSB- 2001 -RSB- QB 407 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	47	Sir Andrew Morritt V-C recognised there was considerable force in First County Trust 's submissions in support of the judge 's view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	48	But having analysed the statutory provisions , the court held that the # 250 added to the loan to enable Mrs Wilson to pay the document fee was not ` credit ' for the purposes of the Consumer Credit Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	49	So one of the prescribed terms was not correctly stated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	50	In consequence the agreement was unenforceable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	51	So also was the security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	52	First County Trust was ordered to repay the amount of # 6,900 Mrs Wilson had paid the company after Judge Hull 's judgment together with interest amounting to # 662 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	53	The overall result was that Mrs Wilson was entitled to keep the amount of her loan , pay no interest and recover her car . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	54	The adjourned hearing 7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	55	Sir Andrew Morritt V-C expressed concern at this outcome . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	56	He considered it might be arguable that section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Consumer Credit Act infringes article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the European Convention on Human Rights and article 1 of the First Protocol to the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	57	The court adjourned the further hearing of the appeal for notice to be given to the Crown , pursuant to section 5 of the Human Rights Act , that the court was considering whether to make a declaration of incompatibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	58	The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry was then added as a party to the proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	59	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	60	On 2 May 2001 the court gave judgment at the adjourned hearing : see -LSB- 2001 -RSB- EWCA Civ 633 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- QB 74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	61	The court held that the inflexible exclusion of a judicial remedy by section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- , preventing the court from doing what is just in the circumstances of the case , is disproportionate to the legitimate policy objective of ensuring that particular attention is paid to the inclusion of certain terms in the document signed by the borrower . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	62	It is not possible to read and give effect to section 113 or section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- in a way compatible with First County Trust 's Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	63	The court made a declaration , pursuant to section 4 of the Human Rights Act , that section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- , in so far as it prevents the court from making an enforcement order under section 65 of the Consumer Credit Act unless a document containing all the prescribed terms of the agreement has been signed by the debtor , is incompatible with the rights guaranteed to the creditor by article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Convention and article 1 of the First Protocol to the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	64	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	65	The Secretary of State appealed to your Lordships ' House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	66	First County Trust did not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	67	The Secretary of State accepted that Mrs Wilson 's agreement was not ` properly executed ' within the meaning of section 61 of the Consumer Credit Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	68	She accepted that , in consequence , no enforcement order could be made under section 65 and that the security over the car was unenforceable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	69	The Secretary of State also accepted it is not possible to ` read down ' the relevant provisions of the Consumer Credit Act and thereby save them from any Convention rights incompatibility otherwise existing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	70	But she challenged the decision of the Court of Appeal on several grounds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	71	Her primary submission was that the court has no jurisdiction to make a declaration of incompatibility in relation to events occurring before the Human Rights Act came fully into force on 2 October 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	72	Here , the agreement was made in January 1999 for a period of six months . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	73	Additionally , the parties ' rights were determined before the Human Rights Act came into force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	74	The County Court decision was in September 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	75	Retrospectivity and section 4 of the Human Rights Act 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	76	As everyone knows , the purpose of the Human Rights Act 1998 was to make the human rights and fundamental freedoms set out in the European Convention on Human Rights directly enforceable in this country as part of its domestic law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	77	The question raised by the Secretary of State 's submission is how the Act was intended to operate regarding events occurring before the Act came into force , that is to say , events taking place at a time when these human rights were not as such part of the domestic law of this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	78	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
149	79	Section 1 of the Act defines ` Convention rights ' and states how the relevant articles of the Convention and its Protocols are to have effect for the purposes of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	80	Section 2 provides that when determining a question arising in connection with a Convention right courts must take into account , among other matters , decisions of the European Court of Human Rights and the European Commission of Human Rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	81	I can put these two introductory sections on one side . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	82	Contrary to the submissions of the Secretary of State , I do not think they assist either way on the point now under consideration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	83	They are neutral . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	84	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	85	The Act prescribes two principal means whereby it ` brings human rights home ' from Strasbourg : first , by making provision for the interpretation and amendment of legislation and , secondly , by making it unlawful for a public authority to act in a way incompatible with a Convention right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	86	Sections 3 to 5 and 10 are concerned with the former of these objectives , sections 6 to 9 with the latter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	87	I shall consider the latter group of sections first . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	88	Sections 6 to 9 are forward looking in their reach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	89	Section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- provides that it ` is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	90	On a natural reading this provision is directed at post-Act conduct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	91	The context powerfully supports this interpretation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	92	One would not expect a statute promoting human rights values to render unlawful acts which were lawful when done . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	93	That would be to impose liability where none existed at the time the act was done . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	94	Sections 7 to 9 are concerned with conduct outlawed by section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	95	They prescribe remedial consequences which ensue when a public authority has acted , or proposes to act , in a way ` which is made unlawful by section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- ' : section 7 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	96	It follows therefore that , like section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , sections 7 to 9 are concerned with post-Act events . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	97	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	98	Section 22 -LRB- 4 -RRB- is an exception to this scheme . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	99	It is a curious provision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	100	Commentators and judges have spilled much ink in discussing it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	101	Its effect is that in response to proceedings brought by a public authority a victim of an unlawful act may rely on a Convention right ` whenever the act in question took place ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	102	So this provision enables a victim to assert and rely on a Convention right in respect of conduct which was not unlawful when it took place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	103	In circumstances where section 22 -LRB- 4 -RRB- applies the Human Rights Act gives a remedy in respect of pre-Act conduct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	104	What is not apparent is why , in respect of pre-Act violations of human rights , victims are given a domestic remedy in this one respect but not more widely . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	105	What is special about this one particular situation is not clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	106	But there it is . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	107	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	108	With these provisions in mind I turn to sections 3 and 4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	109	It can be noted at once that section 4 rides in harness with section 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	110	Section 4 contains two prerequisites to the court 's jurisdiction to make a declaration of incompatibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	111	First , subsections -LRB- 2 -RRB- and -LRB- 4 -RRB- of section 4 apply to proceedings in which the court ` determines ' whether a legislative provision is compatible with a Convention right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	112	So section 4 does not apply unless the court , in the proceedings in question , actually decides whether the relevant legislation is Convention-compliant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	113	The second prerequisite is that the court must be satisfied the relevant legislative provision is incompatible with a Convention right : section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and -LRB- 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	114	This presupposes that , despite application of the principle of interpretation stated in section 3 , the legislation is non-compliant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	115	In other words , interpretation of the legislation in accordance with section 3 is an essential preliminary step to making a declaration of incompatibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	116	It is an essential preliminary step because the court can not be satisfied the legislation is incompatible until effect has been given to the interpretative obligation set out in section 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	117	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	118	This interpretation of section 4 accords with the consequence flowing from a declaration of incompatibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	119	A declaration of incompatibility triggers the ` fast track ' legislative procedures set out in section 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	120	It would make no sense for these procedures to be set in motion if it remains uncertain whether it is possible to interpret the legislation in a Convention-compliant way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	121	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	122	In the ordinary course this sequential approach goes without saying . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	123	Courts will interpret legislation , as they are required to do , in accordance with section 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	124	Only when they have done this will any question of a declaration of incompatibility arise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	125	But the present case is exceptional because of its transitional nature : the agreement was made pre-Act , and the Court of Appeal was interpreting the legislation post-Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	126	Hence the all-important question : is section 3 applicable in such a case ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	127	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	128	On its face section 3 is of general application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	129	So far as possible legislation must be read and given effect in a way compatible with the Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	130	Section 3 is retrospective in the sense that , expressly , it applies to legislation whenever enacted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	131	Thus section 3 may have the effect of changing the interpretation and effect of legislation already in force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	132	An interpretation appropriate before the Act came into force may have to be reconsidered and revised in post-Act proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	133	This effect of section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- is implicit in section 3 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	134	So much is clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	135	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	136	Considerable difficulties , however , might arise if the new interpretation of legislation , consequent on an application of section 3 , were always to apply to pre-Act events . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	137	It would mean that parties ' rights under existing legislation in respect of a transaction completed before the Act came into force could be changed overnight , to the benefit of one party and the prejudice of the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	138	This change , moreover , would operate capriciously , with the outcome depending on whether the parties ' rights were determined by a court before or after 2 October 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	139	The outcome in one case involving pre-Act happenings could differ from the outcome in another comparable case depending solely on when the cases were heard by a court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	140	Parliament can not have intended section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- should operate in this unfair and arbitrary fashion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	141	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	142	The answer to this difficulty lies in the principle underlying the presumption against retrospective operation and the similar but rather narrower presumption against interference with vested interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	143	These are established presumptions but they are vague and imprecise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	144	As Lord Mustill pointed out in L'Office Cherifien des Phosphates v Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co Ltd -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 486 , 524-525 , the subject matter of statutes is so varied that these generalised maxims are not a reliable guide . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	145	As always , therefore , the underlying rationale should be sought . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	146	This was well identified by Staughton LJ in Secretary of State for Social Security v Tunnicliffe -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 2 All ER 712 , 724 : ` the true principle is that Parliament is presumed not to have intended to alter the law applicable to past events and transactions in a manner which is unfair to those concerned in them , unless a contrary intention appears . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	147	It is not simply a question of classifying an enactment as retrospective or not retrospective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	148	Rather it may well be a matter of degree - the greater the unfairness , the more it is to be expected that Parliament will make it clear if that is intended . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	149	Thus the appropriate approach is to identify the intention of Parliament in respect of the relevant statutory provision in accordance with this statement of principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	150	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	151	Applying this approach to the Human Rights Act , I agree with Mummery LJ in Wainwright v Home Office -LSB- 2001 -RSB- EWCA Civ 2081 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- QB 1334 , 1352 , para 61 , that in general the principle of interpretation set out in section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- does not apply to causes of action accruing before the section came into force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	152	The principle does not apply because to apply it in such cases , and thereby change the interpretation and effect of existing legislation , might well produce an unfair result for one party or the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	153	The Human Rights Act was not intended to have this effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	154	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	155	I emphasise that this conclusion does not mean that section 3 never applies to pre-Act events . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	156	Whether section 3 applies to pre-Act events depends upon the application of the principle identified by Staughton LJ in the context of the particular issue before the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	157	To give one important instance : different considerations apply to post-Act criminal trials in respect of pre-Act happenings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	158	The prosecution does not have an accrued or vested right in any relevant sense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	159	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	160	In the present case Parliament can not have intended that application of section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- should have the effect of altering parties ' existing rights and obligations under the Consumer Credit Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	161	For the purpose of identifying the rights of Mrs Wilson and First County Trust under their January 1999 agreement the Consumer Credit Act is to be interpreted without reference to section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	162	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	163	It follows that , in this transitional type of case concerning the Consumer Credit Act , no question can arise of the court making a declaration of incompatibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	164	For the reasons already considered , it is only when a court is called upon to interpret legislation in accordance with section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- that the court may proceed , where appropriate , to make a declaration of incompatibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	165	The court can make a declaration of incompatibility only where section 3 is available as an interpretative tool . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	166	That is not this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	167	The court as a public authority 24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	168	The Court of Appeal reached a contrary conclusion on the applicability of Convention rights by a different route . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	169	The court held that the relevant event is not the making of the January 1999 agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	170	The relevant event is the Court of Appeal 's order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	171	The court is a public authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	172	The court , required by section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- to act in a way compatible with Convention rights , must have regard to the facts as they are at the time when it makes its order : -LSB- 2002 -RSB- QB 74 , 87-89 , paras 17 , 18 and 22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	173	The decision of the Court of Appeal , I should note , was given before the decisions of this House in R v Lambert -LSB- 2001 -RSB- UKHL 37 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 AC 545 , and R v Kansal -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- UKHL 62 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 AC 69 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN

149	175	As is well known , the application of section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- to judicial decisions on matters of substantive law is a highly controversial topic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	176	It is not necessary to venture onto this quicksand in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	177	One insuperable difficulty with the Court of Appeal 's analysis , as it respectfully seems to me , is that it fails to take into account the mandatory nature of the relevant provisions of the Consumer Credit Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	178	Let it be assumed , but without deciding , that the court 's order in these proceedings is an ` act ' by a public authority within the meaning of section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	179	Even so , there can be no question of the court acting unlawfully . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	180	The court 's decision in these proceeding gives effect to the mandatory provisions of the Consumer Credit Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	181	An order giving effect to these provisions of primary legislation is excluded from the scope of section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- by section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	182	Thus , reference to section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- takes the matter no further forward . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	183	The question which remains to be answered is whether , in interpreting and giving effect to the provisions of the Consumer Credit Act in this case , section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Human Rights Act applies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	184	That is the crucial question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	185	That is the question I have already considered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	186	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	187	For these reasons the appeal by the Secretary of State must succeed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	188	In this transitional type of case section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- is inapplicable to the interpretation of the Consumer Credit Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	189	Consequently , the court has no jurisdiction to make a declaration of incompatibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	190	The declaration made by the Court of Appeal should be set aside . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	191	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	192	This conclusion makes it strictly unnecessary for the House to consider the further issues arising out of the judgment of the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	193	But it would not be satisfactory to leave these other issues unresolved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	194	They have been fully argued by experienced counsel , the House has the benefit of the views of the Court of Appeal , and the issues are of importance to innumerable transactions being entered into every day . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	195	I turn , therefore , to consider what the position would be in this case had the Human Rights Act applied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	196	Whether article 6 of the Convention or article 1 of the First Protocol applies 28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	197	The first of the further issues is whether article 6 of the Convention or article 1 of the First Protocol applies in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	198	Before turning to these articles I should outline the salient provisions of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	199	Subject to exemptions , a regulated agreement is an agreement between an individual debtor and another person by which the latter provides the former with a cash loan or other financial accommodation not exceeding a specified amount . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	200	Currently the amount is # 25,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	201	Section 61 -LRB- 1 -RRB- sets out conditions which must be satisfied if a regulated agreement is to be treated as properly executed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	202	One of these conditions , in paragraph -LRB- a -RRB- , is that the agreement must be in a prescribed form containing all the prescribed terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	203	The prescribed terms are the amount of the credit or the credit limit , rate of interest -LRB- in some cases -RRB- , how the borrower is to discharge his obligations , and any power the creditor may have to vary what is payable : Consumer Credit -LRB- Agreements -RRB- Regulations 1983 , Schedule 6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	204	The consequence of improper execution is that the agreement is not enforceable against the debtor save by an order of the court : section 65 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	205	Section 127 -LRB- 1 -RRB- provides what is to happen on an application for an enforcement order under section 65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	206	The court ` shall dismiss ' the application if , but only if , the court considers it just to do so having regard to the prejudice caused to any person by the contravention in question and the degree of culpability for it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	207	The court may reduce the amount payable by the debtor so as to compensate him for prejudice suffered as a result of the contravention , or impose conditions , or suspend the operation of any term of the order or make consequential changes in the agreement or security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	208	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	209	The court 's powers under section 127 -LRB- 1 -RRB- are subject to significant qualification in two types of cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	210	The first type is where section 61 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- , regarding signing of agreements , is not complied with . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	211	In such cases the court ` shall not make ' an enforcement order unless a document , whether or not in the prescribed form , containing all the prescribed terms , was signed by the debtor : section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	212	Thus , signature of a document containing all the prescribed terms is an essential prerequisite to the court 's power to make an enforcement order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	213	The second type of case concerns failure to comply with the duty to supply a copy of an executed or unexecuted agreement pursuant to sections 62 and 63 , or failure to comply with the duty to give notice of cancellation rights in accordance with section 64 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	214	Here again , subject to one exception regarding sections 62 and 63 , section 127 -LRB- 4 -RRB- precludes the court from making an enforcement order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	215	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	216	These restrictions on enforcement of a regulated agreement can not be side-stepped by recourse to a pledge or other form of security furnished in support of the debtor 's obligations under the agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	217	The security is not enforceable to a greater extent than the loan : section 113 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	218	Where an application for an enforcement order is dismissed , except on technical grounds only , or the court makes a declaration under section 142 that the agreement is not enforceable , any security provided in relation to a regulated agreement ` shall be treated as never having effect ' : section 106 -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	219	Property lodged with the creditor by way of security has to be returned by him ` forthwith ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	220	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	221	These restrictions on enforcement of a regulated agreement are for the protection of borrowers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	222	They do not deprive a regulated agreement of all legal effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	223	They do not render a regulated agreement void . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	224	A regulated agreement is enforceable by the debtor against the creditor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	225	It seems , for instance , that a borrower may insist on making further drawdowns under a regulated agreement even though the agreement is unenforceable against him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	226	Further , section 173 -LRB- 3 -RRB- expressly permits consensual enforcement against a borrower . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	227	A borrower may consent to the sale of a security or to judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	228	Moreover , the creditor is entitled to retain any security lodged until either an application for an enforcement order is dismissed or the court makes a declaration under section 142 that the agreement is not enforceable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	229	That is the effect of sections 113 -LRB- 3 -RRB- and 106 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	230	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	231	Against this background I turn to the relevant Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	232	Article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Convention guarantees everyone a fair , expeditious and public trial of disputes about his civil rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	233	This guarantee includes an implied right of access to a court : see Golder v United Kingdom -LRB- 1975 -RRB- EHRR 524 , 536 , para 36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	234	The scope of this guarantee has been considered on many occasions by the European Court of Human Rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	235	The relevant principles were explored recently by your Lordships ' House in Matthews v Ministry of Defence -LSB- 2003 -RSB- UKHL 4 , -LSB- 2003 -RSB- 3 WLR 435 : see , for instance , the pithy introductory summary by Lord Bingham of Cornhill , at para 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	236	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	237	For present purposes it is sufficient to note that the established case law of the European Court of Human Rights is to the effect that article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- does not itself guarantee any particular content for civil rights and obligations in the substantive law of the Contracting States . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
149	238	Section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- applies only to disputes over what , at least arguably , are recognised under domestic law to be ` rights and obligations ' : see Z v United Kingdom -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 2 FLR 612 , 634 , para 87 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	239	Article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- may not be used as a means of creating a substantive civil right having no basis in national law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	240	The content of substantive national law may call for scrutiny under other articles of the Convention or its Protocols , but that is not the target of article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	241	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	242	The basic principle underlying article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- is that ` civil claims must be capable of being submitted to a judge for adjudication ' : see Fayed v United Kingdom -LRB- 1994 -RRB- 18 EHRR 393 , 429 , para 65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	243	Thus a typical case within article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- is where a person enjoys under national law what is arguably a civil right but the only forum for deciding a dispute over the existence or enforcement of the right is a tribunal which is not independent and impartial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	244	So procedural bars on bringing claims to court may fall within article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	245	So also may procedural bars having the effect of preventing claims being decided on their merits . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	246	Tinnelly & Sons Ltd v United Kingdom -LRB- 1998 -RRB- 27 EHRR 249 , 288-292 , paras 72 to 79 , is an example of the latter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	247	The issue of a ` national security ' certificate had the effect of preventing complaints of religious discrimination being considered on their merits by a Fair Employment Tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	248	That was a violation of article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	249	The distinction between the substantive content of a right and an unacceptable procedural bar to its enforcement by a court can give rise to difficulty in distinguishing the one from the other in a particular case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	250	As a matter of drafting , a restriction on the scope of a right may be framed in several different ways . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	251	But the drafting technique chosen by the draftsman can not be determinative of this issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	252	Human Rights conventions are concerned with substance , not form , with practicalities and realities , not linguistic niceties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	253	The crucial question in the present context is whether , as a matter of substance , the relevant provision of national law has the effect of preventing an issue which ought to be decided by a court from being so decided . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	254	The touchstone in this regard is the proper role of courts in a democratic society . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	255	A right of access to a court is one of the checks on the danger of arbitrary power . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	256	In Matthews v Ministry of Defence -LSB- 2003 -RSB- UKHL 4 , -LSB- 2003 -RSB- 3 WLR 435 , 477 , para 142 , Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe noted that article 6 is in principle concerned with the procedural fairness and integrity of a state 's judicial system . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	257	Lord Hoffmann observed , at p. 447 , para 29 , that it should not matter how the law is framed , provided one holds onto the underlying principle , which is to maintain the rule of law and the separation of powers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	258	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	259	In the present case the essence of the complaint is that section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Consumer Credit Act has the effect that a regulated agreement is not enforceable unless a document containing all the prescribed terms is signed by the debtor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	260	In my view , thus framed , the complaint does not bring article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- into play . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	261	In terms of labels , that is a restriction on the scope of the rights a creditor acquires under a regulated agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	262	It does not bar access to court to decide whether the case is caught by the restriction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	263	It does bar a court from exercising any discretion over whether to make an enforcement order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	264	But in taking that power away from a court the legislature was not encroaching on territory which ought properly to be the province of the courts in a democratic society . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	265	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	266	In reaching the opposite conclusion the Court of Appeal focused on the exclusion of any meaningful consideration by the court of the creditor 's rights under the agreement in a case where the document signed by the debtor does not include all the prescribed terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	267	The court held that the exclusion of any judicial remedy in such a case engages article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- : -LSB- 2002 -RSB- QB 74 , 92-93 , paras 31 , 32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	268	I am unable to agree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	269	The inability of the court to make an enforcement order in such a case , whatever the circumstances , is a limitation on the substantive scope of a creditor 's rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	270	It no more offends the rule of law and the separation of powers than would be the case if Parliament had said that such an agreement is void . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	271	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	272	In contrast to article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , article 1 of the First Protocol is concerned with the content of substantive national law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	273	Article 1 provides : ` Every natural and legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	274	No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law ... The preceding provisions shall not , however , in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest ... ' 39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	275	On its face article 1 is engaged in this case , most obviously with regard to the BMW car delivered by Mrs Wilson to First County Trust as security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	276	On delivery First County Trust as pawnee acquired a proprietary interest in the car . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	277	That was in January 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	278	The company 's proprietary interest ceased eight months later , in September 1999 , when the court refused to make an enforcement order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	279	In addition , both parties acquired contractual rights under the agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	280	` Possessions ' in article 1 is apt to embrace contractual rights as much as personal rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	281	Contractual rights may be more valuable and enduring than proprietary rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	282	But , by virtue of the statute , the contractual rights acquired by First County Trust were enforceable only with the consent of the borrower pursuant to section 173 -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	283	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	284	The response of the Secretary of State and others is that all the rights acquired by First County Trust under the agreement were from their inception subject to the limitations prescribed by the Consumer Credit Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	285	A restriction on the scope of the rights acquired by a lender under a transaction is not within article 1 of the First Protocol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	286	A person who acquires property subject to limitations under national law which subsequently bite according to their tenor can not complain that his rights under article 1 of the First Protocol have been infringed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	287	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	288	I do not agree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	289	This proposition is stated too widely and too loosely to be acceptable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	290	Clearly , the expiry of a limited interest such as a licence in accordance with its terms does not engage article 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	291	That is not this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	292	Here the transaction between the parties provided for repayment of the loan and for the car to be held as security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	293	What is in issue is the ` lawfulness ' of overriding legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	294	The proposition advanced by the Secretary of State would mean that however arbitrary or discriminatory such legislation might be , if it was in existence when the transaction took place a court enforcing human rights values would be impotent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	295	A Convention right guaranteeing a right of property would have nothing to say . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	296	That is not an attractive conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	297	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	298	There are of course many circumstances where statutes empower the executive or the courts to make orders depriving a person of some of his possessions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	299	Compulsory acquisition , and property adjustment orders on divorce , are instances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	300	The exercise of powers such as these prima facie engages article 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	301	This is so irrespective of whether the enabling statute was enacted before or after the property affected by the order was acquired . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	302	Hakansson v Sweden -LRB- 1990 -RRB- 13 EHRR 1 is an example where the law was in place before the property in question was acquired . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	303	The law providing for the compulsory resale of the applicants ' land within two years existed when they bought the land . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	304	Thus a provision in the Consumer Credit Act empowering a court to refuse to enforce a regulated agreement may engage article 1 even though the Act was in force before the agreement was entered into . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	305	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	306	In the present case the relevant statutory provisions are framed differently . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	307	They do not empower the court to refuse to enforce the agreement now in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	308	They go further . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	309	The court is compelled to refuse to make an enforcement order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	310	Is this difference material ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	311	I think not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	312	It would be passing strange if article 1 were engaged in the former case but not the latter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	313	A law regulating the effect of a transaction between the parties in the public interest does not always escape review under article 1 of the First Protocol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	314	Such a law may infringe article 1 if it creates an ` imbalance ' between the parties which would result in one party being arbitrarily or unjustly deprived of his possessions for the benefit of the other : see Bramelid v Sweden -LRB- 1983 -RRB- 5 EHRR 249 , 256 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	315	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	316	Thus the question in the present case is one of characterisation of the nature and effect of the relevant provisions of the Consumer Credit Act , considered as a matter of substance rather than form . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	317	In my view , consistently with the underlying objective of article 1 of the First Protocol , the relevant provisions in the Consumer Credit Act are more readily and appropriately characterised as a statutory deprivation of the lender 's rights of property in the broadest sense of that expression than as a mere delimitation of the extent of the rights granted by a transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	318	The rigid ban on enforcement of security and contractual rights prescribed by section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- alone and in conjunction with sections 106 and 113 engages article 1 of the First Protocol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	319	The lender 's rights were extinguished in favour of the borrower by legislation for which the state is responsible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	320	This was a deprivation of possessions within the meaning of article 1 : see James v United Kingdom -LRB- 1986 -RRB- 8 EHRR 123,140 , para 38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	321	Whether this statutory interference with First County Trust 's peaceful enjoyment of its possessions was justified , and therefore not a breach of article 1 , is a separate issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	322	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	323	I do not think there is any inconsistency between this conclusion and the conclusion stated above regarding article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	324	A statutory provision may be characterised at one and the same time as a limitation on the scope of a creditor 's rights for the purposes of article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and as a law depriving a person of his possessions for the -LRB- different -RRB- purposes of article 1 of the First Protocol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	325	Restitution 46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	326	Before considering whether section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- is compatible with article 1 of the First Protocol I must digress to deal with two preliminary matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	327	The first concerns the legal consequences of section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	328	When a regulated agreement is rendered irredeemably unenforceable by section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- , the lender is unable to enforce the agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	329	But does he , quite apart from his -LRB- unenforceable -RRB- rights under the agreement , have a restitutionary claim against the borrower in respect of the money lent ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	330	The parties to the agreement intended the money would be repayable in accordance with the terms of the agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	331	Inability to enforce the terms of the agreement does not inevitably carry with it the consequence that the borrower may simply keep the money . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	332	Retention of the money , it is said , would be unjust enrichment , for which the appropriate remedy would be an order that the borrower repay what was never intended to be other than a loan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	333	Reliance was placed , by way of analogy , on the decision of the Court of Appeal in Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 WLR 938 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	334	There a bank paid money to a local authority under an interest rate swap agreement , which was held later to be outside the local authority 's powers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	335	The local authority had been unjustly enriched and the bank was entitled to a restitutionary remedy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	336	47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	337	A secondary question also arises : if the lender does have a restitutionary claim , is that a matter to be taken into account when considering whether section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- is compatible with article 1 of the First Protocol ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	338	48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	339	I can deal with these two questions quite shortly , starting with the latter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	340	I am in no doubt that a lender 's restitutionary remedy , if he has one , is a matter to be taken into account when considering whether section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- is compatible with article 1 of the First Protocol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	341	The adverse consequences of an alleged infringement of a Convention right can not sensibly be assessed other than in the round . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	342	The real position of the claimant is what matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	343	If in practice a lender can ameliorate the immediate and directly adverse consequence of section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- by resort to some other right or remedy readily available to him , that is a matter to which the court must have regard . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	344	I can not accept the contrary arguments addressed to the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	345	49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	346	I consider , however , that there is no relevant restitutionary remedy generally available to a lender in the circumstances now under consideration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	347	The message to be gleaned from sections 65 , 106 , 113 and 127 of the Consumer Credit Act is that where a court dismisses an application for an enforcement order under section 65 the lender is intended by Parliament to be left without recourse against the borrower in respect of the loan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	348	That being the consequence intended by Parliament , the lender can not assert at common law that the borrower has been unjustly enriched . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	349	That would be inconsistent with the parliamentary intention in rendering the entire agreement unenforceable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	350	True , the Consumer Credit Act does not expressly negative any other remedy available to the lender , nor does it render an improperly executed agreement unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	351	But when legislation renders the entire agreement inoperative , to use a neutral word , for failure to comply with prescribed formalities the legislation itself is the primary source of guidance on what are the legal consequences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	352	Here the intention of Parliament is clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	353	50 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	354	This interpretation of the Consumer Credit Act accords with the approach adopted by the House in Orakpo v Manson Investments Ltd -LSB- 1978 -RSB- AC 95 , regarding section 6 of the Moneylenders Act 1927 and , more recently , in Dimond v Lovell -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 AC 384 , another case where section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- precluded the making of an enforcement order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	355	In Dimond 's case the restitutionary remedy sought was payment of the hire charge for a replacement car used by Mrs Dimond . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	356	The House rejected a claim advanced on the basis of unjust enrichment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	357	Lord Hoffmann observed that Parliament contemplated that a debtor might be enriched consequential upon non-enforcement of an agreement pursuant to the statutory provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	358	It was not open to the court to say this consequence is unjust and should be reversed by a remedy at common law : -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 AC 384 , 397-398 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	359	Use of Hansard in compatibility cases 51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	360	The second preliminary matter concerns the Court of Appeal 's use of Hansard in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	361	When considering whether this was a case where the courts should be ready to defer to the considered opinion of elected representatives , the Court of Appeal , at -LSB- 2002 -RSB- QB 74 , 93-94 , para 33 , pointed to the need for the court to identify the social policy issue which the legislature or the executive thought it necessary to address and ` the thinking which led to that issue being dealt with in the way that it was ' : ` It is one thing to accept the need to defer to an opinion which can be seen to be the product of reasoned consideration based on policy ; it is quite another thing to be required to accept , without question , an opinion for which no reason of policy is advanced . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	362	52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	363	In this connection the Court of Appeal considered the ` lengthy gestation ' of the Consumer Credit Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	364	The court referred to parliamentary debates on the Bill , not as an aid to interpretation , but on the reason which led Parliament to enact section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	365	The Court of Appeal concluded that the debates provide no answer to this issue : such references as there are ` tend to confuse rather than to illuminate ' -LRB- para 36 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	366	The court added , in para 37 : ` In the present case , therefore , we are left without the assistance which examination of reports , preparatory material and debates in Parliament might have been expected to provide on the question : `` why was it thought necessary to deny to the courts the power to do what was just in those cases in which there was no document signed by the debtor which contained terms which would or might , at some future date , be prescribed by the Secretary of State ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	367	... We have been shown no material which helps us to understand why the executive thought it necessary to propose , or why Parliament thought it necessary to enact , section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1974 Act in the form which it takes . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	368	53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	369	Although the references to Hansard in the present case were inconclusive , Mr Sumption QC expressed to your Lordships ' House the concern of the Speaker of the House of Commons and of the Clerk of the Parliaments at the ` wider significance ' of the exercise undertaken by the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	370	This exercise , he submitted , involved measuring against standards derived from the Convention the acceptability of Parliament 's reasons for legislating in a particular way , and doing so by reference to the ` thinking ' apparent from the record of debates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	371	Further , it involved treating the absence of expressed reasons , acceptable or otherwise , as a factor making it more difficult to justify the enactment in Convention terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	372	The courts should not treat speeches made in Parliament , whether by ministers or others , as evidence of the policy considerations which led to legislation taking a particular form . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	373	The exercise on which the Court of Appeal engaged is not an appropriate exercise for a court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	374	There are no circumstances in which it is appropriate for a court to refer to the record of parliamentary debates in order to decide whether an enactment is compatible with the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	375	The policy and objects of a statute must by determined by interpreting its language , which alone represents Parliament 's intention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	376	Reference to debates for the purpose of determining whether the policy considerations put forward by those participating in debates in either House were justifiable in Convention terms and proportionate to the remedy proposed would involve ` questioning ' what is said in Parliament contrary to article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1689 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	377	That is a different exercise from the one undertaken in Pepper v Hart -LSB- 1993 -RSB- AC 593 , and it is an exercise essentially adverse to Parliament 's intention , not supportive of it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	378	54 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	379	These submissions raise a point of constitutional importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	380	This House sitting in its judicial capacity is keenly aware , as indeed are all courts , of the importance of the legislature and the judiciary discharging their own constitutional roles and not trespassing inadvertently into the other 's province . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	381	Thus , in resolving any question which may arise on the practical application of this principle in a particular case , the courts welcome the participation of the Speaker of the House of Commons and the Clerk of the Parliaments in the proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	382	The House has been much assisted by the submissions made on their behalf by Mr Sumption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	383	The present case is in fact the first time the authorities of Parliament have sought to be heard on the use of Hansard by the courts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	384	55 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	385	The starting point for any consideration of the matters raised by these submissions is , indeed , the respective roles of Parliament and the courts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	386	Parliament enacts legislation , the courts interpret and apply it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	387	The enactment of legislation , and the process by which legislation is enacted , are matters for Parliament , not the courts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	388	Thus , article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1689 provides , in modern spelling , that ` the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	389	This provision is part of the wider principle that the courts and Parliament are both astute to recognise their constitutional roles : Lord Browne-Wilkinson in Prebble v Television New Zealand Ltd -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 1 AC 321 , 332 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	390	These distinct roles reflect one aspect of the separation of powers under this country 's constitution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	391	56 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	392	The decision in Pepper v Hart -LSB- 1993 -RSB- AC 593 removed from the law an irrational exception . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	393	When a court is carrying out its constitutional task of interpreting legislation it is seeking to identify the intention of Parliament expressed in the language used . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	394	This is an objective concept . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	395	In this context the intention of Parliament is the intention the court reasonably imputes to Parliament in respect of the language used . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
149	396	In seeking this intention the courts have recourse to recognised principles of interpretation and also a variety of aids , some internal , found within the statute itself , some external , found outside the statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	397	External aids include the background to the legislation , because no legislation is enacted in a vacuum . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	398	It has long been established that the courts may look outside a statute in order to identify the ` mischief ' Parliament was seeking to remedy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	399	Lord Simon of Glaisdale noted it is ` rare indeed ' that a statute can be properly interpreted without knowing the legislative object : Black-Clawson International Ltd v Papierwerke Waldhof-Aschaffenburg AG -LSB- 1975 -RSB- AC 591 , 647 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	400	Reports of the Law Commission or advisory committees , and government white papers , are everyday examples of background material which may assist in understanding the purpose and scope of legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	401	57 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	402	Before the decision in Pepper v Hart a self-imposed judicial rule excluded use of parliamentary materials as an external aid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	403	The courts drew a veil around everything said in Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	404	This had the consequence that a statement made in a government white paper , issued by the relevant government department before legislation was introduced , could be used as an external aid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	405	But if the same statement were made by a minister of the department in Parliament when promoting the Bill in one or other House , the courts were strictly unable to take cognisance of the minister 's statement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	406	58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	407	In relaxing this self-imposed rule the House enunciated some practical safeguards in Pepper v Hart . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	408	These were intended to keep references to Hansard within reasonable bounds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	409	One of these safeguards is that the parliamentary statement must be made by the minister or other promoter of the Bill . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	410	In imposing this cautionary limitation the House was not , I believe , intending to attribute to ministerial statements some special status , thereby encroaching upon the court 's constitutional task of determining objectively what was the intention of Parliament in using the language in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	411	A clear and unambiguous ministerial statement is part of the background to the legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	412	In the words of Lord Browne-Wilkinson in Pepper v Hart -LSB- 1993 -RSB- AC 593 , 635 , such statements ` are as much background to the enactment of legislation as white papers and Parliamentary reports ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	413	But they are no more than part of the background . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	414	As I emphasised in R v Secretary of State for the Environment , Transport and the Regions , Ex parte Spath Holme Ltd -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 2 AC 349 , 399 , however such statements are made and however explicit they may be , they can not control the meaning of an Act of Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	415	59 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	416	Suggestions have been made that unequivocal ministerial statements made in Parliament regarding an ambiguous provision in a Bill may have a more exalted role . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	417	In his influential article ` Pepper v Hart ; A Re-examination ' -LRB- 2001 -RRB- 21 OJLS 59 , Lord Steyn noted it may be unobjectionable for a judge to use Hansard to identify the mischief at which a statute is aimed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	418	But he rightly drew attention to the conceptual and constitutional difficulties in treating the intentions of the government revealed in debates as reflecting the will of Parliament , as distinct from the possibility that they may give rise to an estoppel or the like against the government . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	419	60 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	420	In the present case Mr Sumption did not submit that Pepper v Hart was wrongly decided . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	421	Nor is it necessary to decide whether Pepper v Hart does more than permit courts , when ascertaining the intention of Parliament , to have regard to ministerial statements made in Parliament in the same way as they may have regard to ministerial statements made outside Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	422	What is important is to recognise there are occasions when courts may properly have regard to ministerial and other statements made in Parliament without in any way ` questioning ' what has been said in Parliament , without giving rise to difficulties inherent in treating such statements as indicative of the will of Parliament , and without in any other way encroaching upon parliamentary privilege by interfering in matters properly for consideration and regulation by Parliament alone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	423	The use by courts of ministerial and other promoters ' statements as part of the background of legislation , pursuant to Pepper v Hart , is one instance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	424	Another instance is the established practice by which courts , when adjudicating upon an application for judicial review of a ministerial decision , may have regard to a ministerial statement made in Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	425	The decision of your Lordships ' House in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex p Brind -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 AC 696 is an example of this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	426	I now turn to consider whether a challenge to the compatibility of legislation with Convention rights may be a further instance of the innocuous use by courts of statements made in Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	427	61 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	428	The Human Rights Act 1998 requires the court to exercise a new role in respect of primary legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	429	This new role is fundamentally different from interpreting and applying legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	430	The courts are now required to evaluate the effect of primary legislation in terms of Convention rights and , where appropriate , make a formal declaration of incompatibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	431	In carrying out this evaluation the court has to compare the effect of the legislation with the Convention right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	432	If the legislation impinges upon a Convention right the court must then compare the policy objective of the legislation with the policy objective which under the Convention may justify a prima facie infringement of the Convention right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	433	When making these two comparisons the court will look primarily at the legislation , but not exclusively so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	434	Convention rights are concerned with practicalities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	435	When identifying the practical effect of an impugned statutory provision the court may need to look outside the statute in order to see the complete picture , as already instanced in the present case regarding the possible availability of a restitutionary remedy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	436	As to the objective of the statute , at one level this will be coincident with its effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	437	At this level , the object of section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- is to prevent an enforcement order being made when the circumstances specified in that provision apply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	438	But that is not the relevant level for Convention purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	439	What is relevant is the underlying social purpose sought to be achieved by the statutory provision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	440	Frequently that purpose will be self-evident , but this will not always be so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	441	62 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	442	The legislation must not only have a legitimate policy objective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	443	It must also satisfy a ` proportionality ' test . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	444	The court must decide whether the means employed by the statute to achieve the policy objective is appropriate and not disproportionate in its adverse effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	445	This involves a ` value judgment ' by the court , made by reference to the circumstances prevailing when the issue has to be decided . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	446	It is the current effect and impact of the legislation which matter , not the position when the legislation was enacted or came into force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	447	-LRB- I interpose that in the present case no suggestion was made that there has been any relevant change of circumstances since the Consumer Credit Act was enacted . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	448	63 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	449	When a court makes this value judgment the facts will often speak for themselves . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	450	But sometimes the court may need additional background information tending to show , for instance , the likely practical impact of the statutory measure and why the course adopted by the legislature is or is not appropriate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	451	Moreover , as when interpreting a statute , so when identifying the policy objective of a statutory provision or assessing the ` proportionality ' of a statutory provision , the court may need enlightenment on the nature and extent of the social problem -LRB- the ` mischief ' -RRB- at which the legislation is aimed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	452	This may throw light on the rationale underlying the legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	453	64 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	454	This additional background material may be found in published documents , such as a government white paper . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	455	If relevant information is provided by a minister or , indeed , any other member of either House in the course of a debate on a Bill , the courts must also be able to take this into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	456	The courts , similarly , must be able to have regard to information contained in explanatory notes prepared by the relevant government department and published with a Bill . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	457	The courts would be failing in the due discharge of the new role assigned to them by Parliament if they were to exclude from consideration relevant background information whose only source was a ministerial statement in Parliament or an explanatory note prepared by his department while the Bill was proceeding through Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	458	By having regard to such material the court would not be ` questioning ' proceedings in Parliament or intruding improperly into the legislative process or ascribing to Parliament the views expressed by a minister . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	459	The court would merely be placing itself in a better position to understand the legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	460	65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	461	To that limited extent there may be occasion for the courts , when conducting the statutory ` compatibility ' exercise , to have regard to matters stated in Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	462	It is a consequence flowing from the Human Rights Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	463	The constitutionally unexceptionable nature of this consequence receives some confirmation from the view expressed in the unanimous report of the parliamentary Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege -LRB- 1999 -RRB- -LRB- HL Paper 43-I , HC 214-I -RRB- , p 28 , para 86 , that it is difficult to see how there could be any objection to the court taking account of something said in Parliament when there is no suggestion the statement was inspired by improper motives or was untrue or misleading and there is no question of legal liability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	464	66 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	465	I expect that occasions when resort to Hansard is necessary as part of the statutory ` compatibility ' exercise will seldom arise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	466	The present case is not such an occasion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	467	Should such an occasion arise the courts must be careful not to treat the ministerial or other statement as indicative of the objective intention of Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	468	Nor should the courts give a ministerial statement , whether made inside or outside Parliament , determinative weight . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	469	It should not be supposed that members necessarily agreed with the minister 's reasoning or his conclusions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	470	67 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	471	Beyond this use of Hansard as a source of background information , the content of parliamentary debates has no direct relevance to the issues the court is called upon to decide in compatibility cases and , hence , these debates are not a proper matter for investigation or consideration by the courts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	472	In particular , it is a cardinal constitutional principle that the will of Parliament is expressed in the language used by it in its enactments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	473	The proportionality of legislation is to be judged on that basis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	474	The courts are to have due regard to the legislation as an expression of the will of Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	475	The proportionality of a statutory measure is not to be judged by the quality of the reasons advanced in support of it in the course of parliamentary debate , or by the subjective state of mind of individual ministers or other members . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	476	Different members may well have different reasons , not expressed in debates , for approving particular statutory provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	477	They may have different perceptions of the desirability or likely effect of the legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	478	Ministerial statements , especially if made ex tempore in response to questions , may sometimes lack clarity or be misdirected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	479	Lack of cogent justification in the course of parliamentary debate is not a matter which ` counts against ' the legislation on issues of proportionality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	480	The court is called upon to evaluate the proportionality of the legislation , not the adequacy of the minister 's exploration of the policy options or of his explanations to Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	481	The latter would contravene article 9 of the Bill of Rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	482	The court would then be presuming to evaluate the sufficiency of the legislative process leading up to the enactment of the statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	483	I agree with Laws LJ 's observations on this in International Transport Roth GmbH v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 3 WLR 344 , 386 , paras 113-114 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	484	Article 1 of the First Protocol and proportionality 68 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	485	I turn now to consider whether section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Consumer Credit Act is compatible with the rights guaranteed by article 1 of the First Protocol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	486	Inherent in article 1 is the need to hold a fair balance between the public interest and the protection of the fundamental rights of creditors such as First County Trust . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	487	It is common ground that section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- pursues a legitimate aim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	488	The fairness of a system of law governing the contractual or property rights of private persons is a matter of public concern . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	489	Legislative provisions intended to bring about such fairness are capable of being in the public interest , even if they involve the compulsory transfer of property from one person to another : see the leasehold enfranchisement case of James v United Kingdom -LRB- 1986 -RRB- 8 EHRR 123 , 141 , para 41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	490	More specifically , persons wishing to borrow money are often vulnerable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	491	There is a public interest in protecting such persons from exploitation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	492	69 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	493	There must also be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	494	The means chosen to cure the social mischief must be appropriate and not disproportionate in its adverse impact . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	495	Whether that relationship exists in the case of section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- is the key issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	496	70 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	497	In approaching this issue , as noted in R v Johnstone -LSB- 2003 -RSB- UKHL 28 para 51 , courts should have in mind that theirs is a reviewing role . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	498	Parliament is charged with the primary responsibility for deciding whether the means chosen to deal with a social problem are both necessary and appropriate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	499	Assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of the various legislative alternatives is primarily a matter for Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	500	The possible existence of alternative solutions does not in itself render the contested legislation unjustified : see the Rent Act case of Mellacher v Austria -LRB- 1989 -RRB- 12 EHRR 391 , 411 , para 53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	501	The court will reach a different conclusion from the legislature only when it is apparent that the legislature has attached insufficient importance to a person 's Convention right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	502	The readiness of a court to depart from the views of the legislature depends upon the circumstances , one of which is the subject matter of the legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	503	The more the legislation concerns matters of broad social policy , the less ready will be a court to intervene . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	504	71 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	505	I turn to the statutory setting of section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	506	The Consumer Credit Act contains many requirements about the form and contents of regulated agreements . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	507	Parliament has singled out some obligations as having such importance that non-compliance leads automatically and inflexibly to a ban on the making of an enforcement order whatever the circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	508	These obligations are specified in section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- and -LRB- 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	509	In these two subsections Parliament has chosen , deliberately , to exclude consideration of what is just and equitable in the particular case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	510	The latter approach , enabling the court to consider the circumstances of the particular case , was adopted as the general rule in section 127 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	511	Section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- and -LRB- 4 -RRB- are , expressly , exceptions to the general rule . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	512	In prescribing these two exceptions Parliament must be taken to have considered that the sanction generally attaching to non-compliance with the statutory requirements was not sufficient to achieve compliance with the duty to include all the prescribed terms in the agreement -LRB- section 61 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- -RRB- or the duties to provide copies and notice of cancellation rights -LRB- sections 62 to 64 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	513	Something more drastic was needed in order to focus attention on the need for lenders to comply strictly with these particular obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	514	72 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	515	Undoubtedly , as illustrated by the facts of the present case , section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- may be drastic , even harsh , in its adverse consequences for a lender . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	516	He loses all his rights under the agreement , including his rights to any security which has been lodged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	517	Conversely , the borrower acquires what can only be described as a windfall . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	518	He keeps the money and recovers his security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	519	These consequences apply just as much where the lender was acting in good faith throughout and the error was due to a mistaken reading of the complex statutory requirements as in cases of deliberate non-compliance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	520	These consequences also apply where , as in the present case , the borrower suffered no prejudice as a result of the non-compliance as they do where the borrower was misled . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	521	Parliament was painting here with a broad brush . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	522	73 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	523	The unattractive feature of this approach is that it will sometimes involve punishing the blameless pour encourager les autres . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	524	On its face , considered in the context of one particular case , a sanction having this effect is difficult to justify . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	525	The Moneylenders Act 1927 adopted a similarly severe approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	526	Infringement of statutory requirements rendered the loan and any security unenforceable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	527	So did the Hire Purchase Act 1965 , although to a lesser extent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	528	This approach was roundly condemned in the Crowther report -LRB- Report of the Committee on Consumer Credit , under the presidency of Lord Crowther , March 1971 -RRB- -LRB- Cmnd 4596 -RRB- , vol 1 , p 311 , para 6.11.4 : ` It offends every notion of justice or fairness that because of some technical slip which in no way prejudices him , a borrower , having received a substantial sum of money , should be entitled to retain or spend it without any obligation to repay a single penny . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	529	74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	530	Despite this criticism I have no difficulty in accepting that in suitable instances it is open to Parliament , when Parliament considers the public interest so requires , to decide that compliance with certain formalities is an essential prerequisite to enforcement of certain types of agreements . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	531	This course is open to Parliament even though this will sometimes yield a seemingly unreasonable result in a particular case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	532	Considered overall , this course may well be a proportionate response in practice to a perceived social problem . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	533	Parliament may consider the response should be a uniform solution across the board . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	534	A tailor-made response , fitting the facts of each case as decided in an application to the court , may not be appropriate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	535	This may be considered an insufficient incentive and insufficient deterrent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	536	And it may fail to protect consumers adequately . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	537	Persons most in need of protection are perhaps the least likely to participate in court proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	538	They may well let proceedings go by default : see , in relation to money lending agreements , the Crowther report , p 236 , para 6.1.19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	539	75 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	540	Nor do I have any difficulty in accepting that money lending transactions as a class give rise to significant social problems . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	541	Bargaining power lies with the lender , and the social evils flowing from this are notorious . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	542	The activities of some lenders have long given the business of money lending a bad reputation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	543	Nor , becoming more specific , do I have any difficulty in accepting , in principle , that Parliament may properly make compliance with the formalities required by the Consumer Credit Act regarding ` prescribed terms ' an essential prerequisite to enforcement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	544	In principle that course must be open to Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	545	It must be open to Parliament to decide that , severe though this sanction may be , it is an appropriate way of protecting consumers as a matter of social policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	546	In making its decision in the present case Parliament had the benefit of experience gained over many years in the working of the Moneylenders Act 1927 and the hire purchase legislation , and also the views of the Crowther committee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	547	Further , it must be open to Parliament so to decide even though the lender 's inability to enforce an agreement will not assist a borrower who consents to the enforcement of the agreement in ignorance of the true legal position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	548	76 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	549	The one point which has caused me difficulty is whether the requirement to state the amount of ` credit ' is sufficiently clear and certain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	550	The more severe the sanction , the more important it is that the law should be unambiguous . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	551	In the present case the confusion over the treatment of the document fee of # 250 as ` credit ' may have been due to a widespread misunderstanding within the trade . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	552	Certainly it was shared by an experienced trial judge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	553	Mr Hibbert on behalf of the Finance and Leasing Association submitted it is sometimes far from easy to apply the complex provisions of the Consumer Credit Act and the ancillary regulations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
149	554	He gave examples of types of cases where , he said , identifying the amount of ` credit ' is fraught with difficulty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	555	77 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	556	That there was genuine confusion in the present case is admitted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	557	But I am not persuaded the degree of uncertainty involved in identifying the amount of ` credit ' is unacceptably high . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	558	The consumer credit legislation has to cope with a wide range of types of transactions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	559	It is not surprising that now and again problems of definition will arise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	560	With the assistance of court decisions points of uncertainty , when they occur , can be clarified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	561	The mere fact that a legal provision is capable of more than one interpretation does not mean that it fails to meet the requirement implied in the Convention concept of ` prescribed by law ' : Vogt v Germany -LRB- 1995 -RRB- 21 EHRR 205 , para 48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	562	Moreover , I have in mind that the statutory provisions apply only to loans up to a prescribed financial limit , currently # 25,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	563	So the exposure of a creditor in any one case is confined . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	564	The burden imposed on him is not excessive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	565	78 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	566	Accordingly , in my view section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- is compatible with article 1 of the First Protocol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	567	79 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	568	The Court of Appeal reached the opposite conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	569	In doing so the court approached the matter from a slightly different angle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	570	The effect of the court 's judgment was to treat section 127 -LRB- 1 -RRB- as the touchstone for proportionality and then require positive justification for any more draconian provision : see -LSB- 2002 -RSB- QB 74 , 95-96 , paras 38-39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	571	I respectfully consider this is an erroneous approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	572	Section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- is one provision in an overall package of measures , some more severe than others , approved by the legislature in response to a perennial social problem . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	573	In this type of case the court should approach the relevant statutory provision without any preconceptions of the requirements of proportionality based on other provisions of the statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	574	The court should simply have regard to the relevant statutory provision and its policy objective and consider whether the provision bears so unfairly on the applicant that it was not open to Parliament to adopt this provision , even as part of an overall package , in response to the social problem in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	575	In other words , is it apparent that Parliament must have attached insufficient importance to the applicant 's Convention right ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	576	As I have indicated , I would answer ` no ' to this question in the present case . 	lord nicholls	self	outcome	0.4	NAN
149	577	80 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	578	As a footnote I should add that in stating this conclusion I am not to be taken as expressing a view on what would be the position if , as is now under consideration , the current limit of # 25,000 were removed and the Consumer Credit Act were to apply to loans regardless of their amount . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	579	An adverse consequence , acceptable for a loan of # 25,000 , may not be acceptable when applied to a loan of # 250,000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

149	584	It is a mark of the importance of the issues which have been raised by the case that neither of the parties to the dispute which have given rise to it have taken any part in the appeal to this House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	585	It has been brought by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry , who was joined as a party to the proceedings in the Court of Appeal in response to a notice which was served on her under section 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Human Rights Act 1998 -LRB- `` the 1998 Act '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	586	It has been responded to by four providers of motor insurance to the general pubic in the United Kingdom , by the Speaker of the House of Commons and the Clerk of the Parliaments -LRB- `` the House Authorities '' -RRB- and by the Finance and Leasing Association which is the leading trade association representing the consumer finance industry .

149	587	Your Lordships have also had the benefit of helpful submissions by an amicus curi ' appointed by the Attorney General . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	588	In this situation the facts of the case may seem to be of little importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

149	593	The first point is that the transaction between Mrs Wilson and First County Trust -LRB- `` FCT '' -RRB- was entered into , was acted upon by both sides and was the subject of proceedings in the County Court all before the relevant provisions of the 1998 Act were brought into force on 2 October 2000 by the Human Rights Act -LRB- Commencement No 2 -RRB- Order 2000 -LRB- SI 2000/1851 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	594	83 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	595	The loan agreement was signed on 22 January 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	596	The loan was for a period of six months . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	597	It was due to be repaid , together with interest , on 21 July 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	598	Mrs Wilson did not repay the loan on that date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	599	On 23 July 1999 FCT sought payment of the amount due under the agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	600	Mrs Wilson then instituted proceedings against FCT in the county court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	601	She sought a declaration under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 -LRB- `` the 1974 Act '' -RRB- that the agreement was unenforceable , its reopening on the ground that the rate of interest at 94.78 % was grossly excessive and an injunction forbidding FCT from disposing of the motor car which it taken from Mrs Wilson in pawn as security for the loan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	602	An interim injunction was granted on 12 August 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	603	On 24 September 1999 the District Judge refused Mrs Wilson 's application for a declaration that the agreement was void and unenforceable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	604	But he granted a declaration that the credit agreement was extortionate , substituted a monthly interest charge at an agreed rate and permitted Mrs Wilson to redeem the motor car on payment of the loan with interest on or before 1 October 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	605	On 18 October 1999 she gave notice of an appeal against the rejection of her claim that the agreement was unenforceable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	606	But on 17 December 1999 she redeemed her car by paying the whole of the sum that was then due to FCT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	607	84 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	608	Mrs Wilson 's appeal against FCT came before the Court of Appeal for hearing on 9 November 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	609	By that date the 1998 Act had come into force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	610	As Sir Andrew Morritt V-C observed when judgment was given on 23 November , neither party relied on it : -LSB- 2001 -RSB- QB 407 , 417F-G , para 25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	611	But he said that that did not absolve the court from considering its application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	612	So it was that the court , having concluded that it was barred by section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1974 Act from enforcing the agreement and that Mrs Wilson was entitled to repayment of the sum which she had paid to redeem her motor car , decided to adjourn the appeal to enable further consideration to be given to the question whether the bar on its enforcement infringed FCT 's Convention rights and , if so , whether it should make a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the 1998 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	613	85 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	614	This brief history shows that the transaction which has given rise to this appeal was over and done with before the relevant provisions of the 1998 Act were brought into force , subject only to the question whether Mrs Wilson is entitled to repayment of the sum which she paid over to redeem her motor car . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	615	This raises a difficult and important question about the extent to which the 1998 Act can be relied upon so as to affect rights and obligations arising from previous transactions -LRB- `` the retrospectivity issue '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	616	Then there is the question whether , if the 1998 Act can be relied upon in these circumstances , the effect of section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1974 Act in the events which have happened is to engage any of FCT 's Convention rights -LRB- `` the Convention rights issue '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	617	86 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	618	The second point is that , in the course of its discussion in the judgment which was delivered on 2 May 2001 of the question whether the provisions of section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1984 Act were incompatible with FCT 's Convention rights , the Court of Appeal examined the content of the debates on the Consumer Credit Bill in Parliament as reported in Hansard in order to identify the aims and issues of social policy which led to its enactment : -LSB- 2001 EWCA Civ 633 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- QB 74 , 94D-95F , paras 35-37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	619	In the Court of Appeal the Secretary of State submitted that an attempt to do this was illegitimate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	620	Her position before your Lordships was , as the learned Attorney General put it on her behalf , more moderate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	621	But he urged caution in the use of this material and criticised the way it had been used by the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	622	The argument that its use is illegitimate has not gone away , however . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	623	It was the subject of submissions made by Mr Sumption QC on behalf of the House Authorities , and it is plain in view of its importance that we must deal with it : -LRB- `` the reference to Hansard issue '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	624	87 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	625	There is one other issue which has to be addressed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	626	As has already mentioned , the Court of Appeal held in its first judgment that the effect of section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1984 Act was that the agreement between Mrs Wilson and FCT was unenforceable and that she was entitled to repayment of the sum which she paid over to redeem her motor car . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	627	Sir Andrew Morritt V-C said that he would not wish to arrive at a conclusion which permitted Mrs Wilson both to retain her car and to recover the money which she paid to redeem it unless the statutory provisions left no alternative : -LSB- 2001 -RSB- QB 407 , 416D , para 20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	628	Having considered the decision of your Lordships ' House in Dimond v Lovell -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 1 AC 384 however he concluded that prima facie she was entitled to the orders which she sought : para 25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	629	FCT have not sought to appeal against this decision , and it will not be disturbed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN

149	632	The Court of Appeal decided that it would be appropriate to declare that , having regard to the terms prescribed by regulation 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of and Schedule 6 to the Consumer Credit -LRB- Agreements -RRB- Regulations 1983 -LRB- SI 1983/1553 -RRB- , the provisions of section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1974 Act , in so far as they prevent the court from making an enforcement order under section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of that Act unless a document containing all the prescribed forms of the agreement has been signed by the debtor or hirer are incompatible with the rights guaranteed to the creditor or hirer by article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Convention and article 1 of the First Protocol : -LSB- 2002 -RSB- QB 74 , 99B-C , para 50 .

149	633	The issue is whether it was open to the Court of Appeal to make this declaration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	634	89 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	635	The Secretary of State submits that it was not open to the Court of Appeal to do so , as sections 1 and 4 of the 1998 Act came into force after the agreement was made , after the due date for payment under that agreement and after judgment had been pronounced in the County Court on Mrs Wilson 's application for a declaration that the agreement was void and unenforceable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	636	Her argument is that FCT had at the relevant times no Convention rights under the 1998 Act that were capable of being infringed by the operation of section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1974 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	637	In short , as the declaration was made in relation to events which occurred before the 1998 Act fully came into force , it offends against the general principle that legislation does not have effect retrospectively : Bennion , Statutory Interpretation , 4th ed -LRB- 2002 -RRB- , pp 265-269 , 689-690 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	638	90 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	639	The only provision in the 1998 Act which gives retrospective effect to any of its provisions is section 22 -LRB- 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	640	It directs attention exclusively to that part of the Act which deals with the acts of public authorities : see sections 6 to 9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	641	What it says is that section 7 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- applies to proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority whenever the act in question took place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	642	I do not think that there is any mystery as to why this provision was included in the 1998 Act , although the consequences that flow from it are much less certain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	643	The explanation lies in the fact that the purpose of sections 6 to 9 of the Act is to provide a remedial structure in domestic law for the rights guaranteed by the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	644	As article 13 of the Convention makes clear , it is the obligation of states which have ratified the Convention to provide everyone within their jurisdiction with an effective remedy if the rights or freedoms which it protects are violated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	645	The scheme of the Act is to give effect in domestic law to the obligation which is set out in article 13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	646	If that scheme was to be followed through , victims had to be given an effective remedy in domestic law for a violation by the state of their Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	647	The principle upon which the Act proceeds is that actions by public authorities are unlawful if they are in breach of Convention rights : section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	648	Effect is given to that principle in section 7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	649	But it was appreciated that victims of a violation by the state of their Convention rights were already entitled to obtain a remedy in the European Court of Human Rights under article 41 of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	650	In that context it made sense for the provisions of section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- to be made available for use defensively where proceedings are brought against the victim by or at the instigation of a public authority , whenever the violation took place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	651	That is what section 22 -LRB- 4 -RRB- achieves by enabling section 7 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- to be given effect retrospectively . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	652	91 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	653	But we are not concerned with the acts of public authorities in this case or with proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	654	There is no claim by a victim that a public authority has acted in a way that is made unlawful by section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	655	92 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	656	It has been held that acts of courts or tribunals which took place before 2 October 2000 which they were required to do by primary legislation and were done according to the meaning which was to be given to the legislation at that time are not affected by section 22 -LRB- 4 -RRB- : see R v Kansal -LSB- 2001 -RSB- UKHL 62 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 AC 69 , 112F-113A , para 84 ; Wainwright v Home Office -LSB- 2001 -RSB- EWCA Civ 2081 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- QB 1334 , 1346A-1347C , paras 29-36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	657	It has also been held that the Act can not be relied upon retrospectively to make unlawful conduct which was lawful at the time when it took place : Wainwright v Home Office -LSB- 2002 -RSB- QB 1334 , 1337G-H para 40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	658	The effect of these decisions is that the 1998 Act can not be applied retroactively so as to deem the law to have been different from what it was when these acts were done . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	659	But we are not concerned in this case with the lawfulness of acts done or the lawfulness of conduct which took place before the Act was brought fully into force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	660	The question in this case is whether the rights and obligations of parties to an agreement made before 2 October 2000 are , as a result of the coming into force of the relevant provisions of the 1998 Act , different now from what they were when the agreement was entered into . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	661	93 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	662	The approach which the Court of Appeal took to this problem was to apply section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1998 Act to the facts of this case , as the court was required by that subsection to act in a way which was compatible with Convention rights , and then to ask itself whether the order which it was about to make was or was not compatible with Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	663	Its conclusion was that , approached in this way , the relevant event was not the making of the agreement on 22 January 1999 but the making of its order on the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	664	Section 22 -LRB- 4 -RRB- had no relevance , as the court had had to have regard to the facts as they were at the time when it made its order : -LSB- 2002 -RSB- QB 74 , 88B , para 17 , 89G-H , para 22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	665	94 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	666	While it is true that the court is required by section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1998 Act to act in a way that is compatible with Convention rights , the issue in this case relates to the meaning and effect of legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	667	The first task which confronts the court in a case of this kind is to construe the provisions of the statute which it is being asked to apply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	668	The question which the Court of Appeal posed for itself in November 2000 was whether it was possible to read and give effect to section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1974 Act in a way that was compatible with FCT 's rights under article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Convention and article 1 of the First Protocol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	669	95 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	670	But one does not need to go to section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1998 Act to discover the obligation which the court had to fulfil in these circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	671	Its obligation is to be found in section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	672	That subsection provides that , so far as it is possible to do so , primary and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way that is compatible with Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	673	A person who claims that a court or tribunal has acted in a way that is made unlawful by section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- may bring proceedings under section 7 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- in the manner provided for by section 9 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and , if compensation is required under article 5 -LRB- 5 -RRB- , may be awarded damages under section 9 -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	674	But a person who claims that a court or tribunal has failed to fulfil the interpretative obligation laid down by section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- has no need to go to section 7 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- for his remedy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	675	The meaning and effect of legislation is a question of law , so if an error is made about this the ordinary avenues of appeal are available . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	676	96 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	677	In my opinion the issue about retrospectivity in this case resolves itself into a question as to whether section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- permits the court , when it is determining after 2 October 2000 whether section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1974 Act is compatible with FCT 's Convention rights , to hold that the rights and obligations of parties to the agreement are , as a result of the coming into force of the relevant provisions of the 1998 Act on that date , different now from what they were at the time when the agreement was entered into in January 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	678	97 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	679	The first thing to notice about section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1998 Act is that , as to its temporal effect , it is entirely general and unqualified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	680	But some guidance can be found in section 3 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- , which says that section 3 applies to primary and secondary legislation `` whenever enacted '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	681	So at least it can be said that it was plainly not the intention that legislation which was enacted before 2 October 2000 should be immune from the interpretative obligation which section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- lays down . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	682	It would have been surprising if the Act had that effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	683	It would have greatly emasculated the underlying concept of bringing human rights home . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	684	98 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	685	Then there is the general presumption that legislation is not intended to operate retrospectively . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	686	That presumption is based on concepts of fairness and legal certainty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	687	These concepts require that accrued rights and the legal effect of past acts should not be altered by subsequent legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	688	But the mere fact that a statute depends for its application in the future on events that have happened in the past does not offend against the presumption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	689	For a recent example of this point reference may be made to R v Field -LSB- 2002 -RSB- EWCA Crim 2913 ; -LSB- 2003 -RSB- 1 WLR 882 -LRB- CA -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	690	In that case it was held that the making of a disqualification order under section 28 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 against a defendant from working with children in the future did not offend against the presumption where the offending behaviour had occurred before that Act came into force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	691	It illustrates the point that there is an important distinction to be made between legislation which affects transactions that have created rights and obligations which the parties seek to enforce against each other and legislation which affects transactions that have resulted in the bringing of proceedings in the public interest by a public authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	692	The concepts of fairness and legal certainty carry much greater weight when it is being suggested that rights or obligations which were acquired or entered into before 2 October 2000 should be altered retrospectively . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	693	99 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	694	Account may also be taken of the purpose of the 1998 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	695	Its long title states that it was intended to give further effect to rights and freedoms guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	696	The rights to which the Act gives effect are rights guaranteed by the Convention which the United Kingdom has already signed and ratified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	697	In R v Field -LSB- 2003 -RSB- 1 WLR 882 , 896E-F , para 61 the Court of Appeal accepted a submission by the Secretary of State for the Home Department that the court should take a more relaxed approach to a potentially retroactive element in legislation where its intended purpose was , as it clearly was in the case of section 28 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 , to protect children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	698	I would apply the same reasoning to section 3 of the 1998 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	699	Its purpose is to ensure that legislation is read and given effect in a way that is compatible with Convention rights , so far as it is possible to do so , whenever the legislation was enacted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	700	To restrict the application of the interpretative obligation , without exception , to `` events '' that happened or `` transactions '' entered into on or after 2 October 2000 would be to introduce a restriction which is not stated expressly anywhere in the 1998 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	701	A restriction in such absolute and all-embracing terms would seem to be contrary to the intention of the legislation and incapable of being read into it by necessary implication . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	702	100 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	703	But the consequence of reading section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1974 Act in a way that is compatible with FCT 's Convention rights can not be looked at without taking account of the effects of doing so on the other party to the transaction , Mrs Wilson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	704	She too acquired rights as a result of the transaction , as well as FCT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	705	The set of provisions of which it forms part , and on which she relies , were enacted for the protection of consumers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	706	Section 61 -LRB- 1 -RRB- provides that a regulated agreement is not properly executed unless it satisfies certain requirements . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	707	It must include a statement of all the prescribed terms , which include a term stating the amount of the credit : paragraph 2 of Schedule 6 to the Consumer Credit -LRB- Agreements -RRB- Regulations 1983 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	708	Section 65 -LRB- 1 -RRB- provides that an improperly executed agreement is enforceable against the debtor or the hirer on an order of the court only . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	709	The amount of the credit in this agreement was incorrectly stated , so Mrs Wilson became entitled to the protection of section 65 -LRB- 1 -RRB- as soon as it was entered into . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	710	What this right meant in her case was spelled out in section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- , which provides : `` The court shall not make an enforcement order under section 65 -LRB- 1 -RRB- if section 61 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- -LRB- signing of agreements -RRB- was not complied with unless a document -LRB- whether or not in the prescribed form and complying with regulations under section 60 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- itself containing all the prescribed terms of the agreement was signed by the debtor or hirer -LRB- whether or not in the prescribed manner -RRB- . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
149	711	101 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	712	Let it be assumed , then , that the effect of section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- is to engage FCT 's Convention rights and that it is possible to read and give effect to the subsection in a way that is compatible with them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	713	This will , inevitably , have the consequence of removing from Mrs Wilson the protection which sections 61 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- , 65 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- were designed to give her when the agreement was entered into . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	714	It seems to me that the presumption against the retrospective effect of legislation ought to be given its full weight in these circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	715	The case may be regarded as a typical example of the situation where legislation in question affects transactions that have created rights and obligations which the parties to it seek to enforce against each other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	716	I recognise that there may be cases -LRB- and I have referred to R v Field -LSB- 2003 -RSB- 1 WLR 882 as an example -RRB- where a more relaxed approach will be appropriate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	717	There is an obvious attraction in a solution to the application of the presumption to the obligation in section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- which depends on clear , bright line rules which do not admit of any exceptions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	718	But rules of that kind would be bound to lead to unfairness in some cases or to have consequences that could not have been intended for other reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	719	So I would prefer to base my decision in this case on the particular facts and circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	720	I would hold that the presumption would be violated in this case if section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- were to be construed in FCT 's favour in a way that deprived Mrs Wilson of the protection which it was designed to give her when she entered into the agreement on 22 January 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	721	102 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	722	It follows that , as a determination of the question whether section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1974 Act could be read and given effect in a way that was compatible with FCT 's Convention rights would offend against the principle that legislation does not have effect retrospectively , it was not open to the Court of Appeal in these proceedings to make a declaration of incompatibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	723	The Convention rights issue 103 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	724	The question is whether the effect of section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1974 Act in the events which have happened is to engage any of FCT 's Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	725	If I am right on the retrospectivity issue this question does not arise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	726	But the Court of Appeal dealt with the question , so I should like to make these brief observations about it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	727	The Convention rights that are in issue are those which are set out in article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Convention and article 1 of the First Protocol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	728	The Court of Appeal asked itself whether the exclusion of what it described as `` any meaningful consideration by the court '' of the creditor 's rights under an improperly executed agreement was legitimate , having regard to the fundamental nature of the right guaranteed by article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , and it held that the exclusion of any judicial remedy engaged that article and also article 1 of the First Protocol : -LSB- 2002 -RSB- QB 74 , 92B - 93F , paras 31 , 32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	729	104 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	730	Article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Convention provides a guarantee to everyone of access to the court for the determination of his or her civil rights and obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	731	As the European Court of Human Rights has explained , this provision must be read in the light of the rule of law referred to in the preamble to the Convention of which an integral part is the principle that a civil claim must be capable of being submitted to a judge : Golder v United Kingdom -LRB- 1975 -RRB- 1 EHRR 524 , paras 35 , 36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	732	A provision which operated as a procedural bar to access to the court for the enforcement of a civil right would be engaged by this article . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	733	But it is for domestic law to determine the extent and content of a person 's civil rights : H v Belgium -LRB- 1987 -RRB- 10 EHRR 339 , para 40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	734	The rights which article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- guarantees are rights of procedural fairness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	735	They do not guarantee that a person 's substantive civil rights are of any particular character . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	736	105 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	737	As the European Court said in Powell v United Kingdom , application no 45305/99 ,4 May 2000 , unreported : `` For the Court , it still remains the case that an applicant must be able to demonstrate an arguable claim under domestic law that there has been a breach of a civil right actionable in law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	738	It is still impermissible for the Court to arrogate to itself the task of creating in favour of an individual a substantive right where none is recognised under domestic law . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	739	What article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- seeks to do , then , is to protect the individual against anything which restricts or impairs his access to the courts for the determination of a civil right whose existence is at least arguable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	740	But the precise scope and content of the individual 's civil rights is a matter for each state party to determine : see also Matthews v Ministry of Defence -LSB- 2002 -RSB- UKHL 4 , -LSB- 2003 -RSB- 2 WLR 435 , 452-543 , paras 49-53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	741	106 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	742	Article 1 of the First Protocol has a similar character . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	743	It does not confer a right of property as such nor does it guarantee the content of any rights in property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	744	What it does instead is to guarantee the peaceful enjoyment of the possessions that a person already owns , of which a person can not be deprived except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law : Marckx v Belgium -LRB- 1979 -RRB- 2 EHRR 330 , para 50 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	745	Here too it is a matter for domestic law to define the nature and extent of any rights which a party acquires from time to time as a result of the transactions which he or she enters into . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	746	One must , of course , distinguish carefully between cases where the effect of the relevant law is to deprive a person of something that he already owns and those where its effect is to subject his right from the outset to the reservation or qualification which is now being enforced against him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	747	The making of a compulsory order or of an order for the division of property on divorce are examples of the former category . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	748	In those cases it is the making of the order , not the existence of the law under which the order is made , that interrupts the peaceful enjoyment by the owner of his property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	749	The fact that the relevant law was already in force when the right of property was acquired is immaterial , if it did not have the effect of qualifying the right from the moment when it was acquired . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	750	107 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	751	The rights of property which are in issue in this case are those set in an agreement which is regulated by the 1974 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	752	The Act subjects the rights of the creditor to restrictions in some circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	753	Section 65 declares that a regulated agreement which is improperly executed can not be enforced by the creditor except by means of an order of the court , and section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- declares that it is not to be enforceable at all except upon the condition which it lays down . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	754	The agreement which was entered into in this case was from the outset an agreement which was improperly executed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	755	So it was always subject to the restrictions on its execution which sections 65 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1974 Act set out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	756	I would hold that FCT 's Convention rights under article 1 of the First Protocol are not engaged in these circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	757	108 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	758	The Court of Appeal said that the effect of sections 65 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- was to deprive the pawnbroker of its ability to enjoy benefit from the contractual rights arising from the agreement or from the rights arising from the delivery of the pawn : para 32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	759	But the fact is that FCT never had an absolute and unqualified right to enforce this agreement or to enforce the rights arising from the delivery of the motor car . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	760	Article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Convention and article 1 of the First Protocol can not be used to confer absolute and unqualified rights on FCT which , having regard to the terms of the statute by which agreements of this kind are regulated , it never had at any time under the improperly executed agreement which it entered into . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	761	109 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	762	As I would hold that article 1 of the First Protocol is not engaged in this case , I do not need to examine the question whether section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- is compatible with the rights guaranteed by that article . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	763	Had it been necessary for me to do so , I would have reached the same conclusion as Lord Nicholls has done for the reasons he gives . 	lord hope	lord nicholls	partagr	0.5	NAN
149	764	The reference to Hansard issue 110 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	765	One of the happy characteristics of the Human Rights Act 1998 is that it did not attempt to solve all the problems that were bound to arise as a result of giving effect in domestic law to Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	766	Among these problems was the effect which its provisions would be likely to have on the relationship between the courts and Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	767	This was left to be worked out in accordance with familiar constitutional principles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	768	111 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	769	One of these principles , which has repeatedly been emphasised , is that legislation is the exclusive responsibility of Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	770	The judges ' task is to interpret , not to legislate : Poplar Housing and Regeneration Community Association Ltd v Donoghue -LSB- 2001 -RSB- EWCA Civ 595 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- QB 48 , 72-73 , para 75 , per Lord Woolf CJ ; R v Lambert -LSB- 2001 -RSB- UKHL 37 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 AC 545 , 585C-D , para 79 ; In re S -LRB- Minors -RRB- -LRB- Care Order : Implementation of Care Plan -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- UKHL 10 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 AC 291 , 313E , para 39 , per Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead . 	lord hope	lord nicholls	partagr	0.5	NAN
149	771	Another is that it is the intention of Parliament that defines the policy and objects of its enactments , not the purpose or intention of the executive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	772	The courts for their part must respect this principle , which means that the legislative function belongs to Parliament not to the executive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	773	Then there is the rule which article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1689 lays down that proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place outside Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	774	For their part both Houses of Parliament abstain from discussing the merits of disputes that are about to be tried and adjudicated on by the courts : Erskine May , Treatise on the Law , Privileges , Proceedings and Usage of Parliament , 22nd ed -LRB- 1997 -RRB- , pp 383-384 , 452-453 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	775	As Lord Nicholls has said , all courts are keenly aware of the importance of the legislature and the judiciary each discharging their own constitutional roles and not trespassing into functions that belong to the other . 	lord hope	lord nicholls	partagr	0.5	NAN
149	776	112 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	777	The question which the House Authorities have raised is therefore an important one , and the position needs to be clarified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	778	It has been prompted by the use which the Court of Appeal made of Hansard in its examination of the question whether this was a case where it should defer , on democratic grounds , to the considered opinion of the legislature : -LSB- 2002 -RSB- QB 74 , 94A-95D , paras 34-36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	779	The Court of Appeal rejected the Secretary of State 's submission that , because the legislation had been enacted , it must be taken to represent the considered opinion of the elected body and that it was not for the courts to question the basis upon which that opinion was reached : para 34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	780	Having done so , it embarked upon an examination of the parliamentary debates on the Bill . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	781	It did this not as an aid to construction of the legislation as its meaning was not in doubt , but to discover the reason which led Parliament to think that it was necessary to enact section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- and thus to deny to the courts the power to do what was just in the cases to which it refers : paras 35-36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	782	113 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	783	Mr Sumption QC for the House Authorities did not seek to question the use of Hansard for the limited purpose described in Pepper v Hart -LSB- 1993 -RSB- AC 593 , although he drew attention to some of the conceptual difficulties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	784	As I understand that decision , it recognised a limited exception to the general rule that resort to Hansard was inadmissible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	785	Its purpose is to prevent the executive seeking to place a meaning on words used in legislation which is different from that which ministers attributed to those words when promoting the legislation in Parliament : R v Secretary of State for the Environment , Ex p Spath Holme Ltd -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 2 AC 349 , 407-408 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	786	Mr Sumption recognised that the exception thus stated has commanded broad acceptance where it has operated as a kind of quasi-estoppel against the executive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	787	He also recognised that Hansard might be referred to where a statement made by a Minister in Parliament was relevant to a challenge by way of judicial review to what he had done : see , for example , R v Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex p Brind -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 AC 696 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	788	This was because what the Minister said in Parliament was evidence of why he acted as he did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	789	The position was no different from what it would have been if his statement had been recorded in a letter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	790	But Mr Sumption stressed that any such exceptions should be clearly defined and that they should be based on principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	791	114 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	792	The concern which he expressed was directed to the use of Hansard in this case for the purpose of seeking to discover from debates in Parliament the reasons which Parliament had for making the enactment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	793	He said that this was quite different from seeking to discover what words mean . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	794	It was one thing to refer to Hansard to ensure that legislation was not misconstrued in favour of the executive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	795	That use could be said to be in support of the principle of Parliamentary sovereignty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	796	It was another to refer to it in order to form a view as to whether Parliament had given sufficient reasons for doing what it did and , if not , whether the legislation was incompatible with Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	797	To use Hansard in this way was to use it for a purpose which was adverse to the intention of Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	798	115 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	799	Mr Sumption put forward two objections to this use of Hansard on grounds of principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	800	The first was that it involved examining the nature and quality of Parliament 's reasoning in a case where there was no doubt about what Parliament had enacted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	801	Where it was used for the purpose explained in Pepper v Hart there was a threshold that had to be satisfied - the test of ambiguity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	802	Here there was no such threshold , as the suggestion was that Hansard could be resorted to however clear were the provisions set out in the enactment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	803	The second was that its object was not to give effect to the will of Parliament but to measure the sufficiency of reasons given for the legislation against standards derived from the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	804	He said that this was contrary to article 9 of the Bill of Rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	805	It was not for the courts to consider whether speeches made during debates in Parliament had put forward Convention-compliant reasons for supporting it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	806	116 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	807	I think that there is much force in these criticisms of the approach which the Court of Appeal took to this issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	808	But it would be going too far to say , as Mr Sumption did , that there are no circumstances where use may be made of Hansard where the purpose of doing so is to answer the question whether legislation is compatible with Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	809	The boundaries between the respective powers and functions of the courts and of Parliament must , of course , be respected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	810	It is no part of the court 's function to determine whether sufficient reasons were given by Parliament for passing the enactment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	811	On the other hand it has to perform the tasks which have been given to it by Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	812	Among those tasks is that to which section 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- refers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	813	It has the task of determining , if the issue is raised , whether a provision of primary legislation is compatible with a Convention right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	814	It does not follow from recognition that there is an area of judgment within which the judiciary will defer to the elected body on democratic grounds that the court is absolutely disabled from forming its own view in these cases as to whether or not the legislation is compatible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	815	That question is ultimately for the court not for Parliament , as Parliament itself has enacted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	816	The harder that question is to answer , the more important it is that the court is equipped with the information that it needs to perform its task . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	817	117 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	818	This , then , is the justification for resorting to Hansard in cases where the question at issue is not one of interpretation but whether the legislation is compatible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	819	A cautious approach is needed , and particular care must be taken not to stray beyond the search for material that will simply inform the court into the forbidden territory of questioning the proceedings in Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	820	To suggest , as the Court of Appeal did at -LSB- 2002 -RSB- QB 74 , para 36 , that what was said in debate tends to confuse rather than illuminate would be to cross that boundary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	821	It is for Parliament alone to decide what reasons , if any , need to be given for the legislation that it enacts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	822	The quality or sufficiency of reasons given by the promoter of the legislation is a matter for Parliament to determine , not the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	823	118 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	824	But proceedings in Parliament are replete with information from a whole variety of sources . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	825	It appears in a variety of forms also , all of which are made public . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	826	Ministers make statements , members ask questions or propose amendments based on information which they have obtained from their constituencies , answers are given to written questions , issues are explored by select committees by examining witnesses and explanatory notes are provided with Bills to assist members in their consideration of it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	827	Resort to information of this kind may cast light on what Parliament 's aim was when it passed the provision which is in question or it may not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	828	If it does not this can not , and must not , be a ground for criticism . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	829	But if it does , the court would be unduly inhibited if it were to be disabled from obtaining and using this information for the strictly limited purpose of considering whether legislation is compatible with Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	830	This is an exercise which the European Court may wish to perform in order to determine , for example , whether the aim of the contested legislation was a legitimate one or whether an interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possession was justified : see James v United Kingdom -LRB- 1986 -RRB- 8 EHRR 123 , 143 , para 48 ; Mellacher v Austria -LRB- 1989 -RRB- 12 EHRR 391 , 409 , para 47 ; Ambruosi v Italy -LRB- 2002 -RRB- 35 EHRR 125 , 131 , para 28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	831	It is an exercise which the domestic court too may perform when it is carrying out the task under section 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1998 Act which has been entrusted to it by Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	832	The Dimond v Lovell issue 119 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	833	The Court of Appeal made it clear in its first judgment that it did not wish to arrive at a conclusion which permitted Mrs Wilson both to retain the car and to recover the # 6,900 unless the statutory provisions left no alternative : -LSB- 2001 -RSB- QB 407 , para 20 , per Sir Andrew Morritt V-C . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	834	But it held , following Lord Hoffmann 's observations in Dimond v Lovell -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 AC 384 , 397-398 , that the effect of section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1974 Act was to render the agreement irredeemably unenforceable and that a claim for unjust enrichment must fail because this was precisely the consequence prescribed by Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	835	120 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	836	Mr Crow for the Secretary of State submitted that Dimond v Lovell -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 AC 384 was distinguishable and that it should not be applied in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	837	He pointed out that the transaction in that case was different from that which Mrs Wilson had entered into with FCT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	838	In Dimond the payments which were in issue were the cost of hiring the replacement car . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	839	It was held that those payments were not recoverable as a matter of contract , and there was no basis for implying an obligation to pay which was contrary to the provisions of the statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	840	In this case Mrs Wilson 's enrichment was not limited to the cost of the loan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	841	It was not just that she was being relieved of the obligation of paying interest on it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	842	Her enrichment extended to the principal of the loan itself , because the effect of section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- was that she kept the sum of # 5,000 as well as the motor car . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	843	He submitted that , while exoneration of the obligation to pay interest was plainly within the contemplation of the statute , retention of the principal sum which had been lent to her under the agreement was not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	844	121 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	845	At first sight there is , to say the least , something odd about the result that Mrs Wilson has achieved in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	846	But the effect of the failure to comply with the requirements of the Consumer Credit -LRB- Agreements -RRB- Regulations 1983 was that the entire agreement under which FCT provided the loan to Mrs Wilson , having taken possession of her car in pawn , was unenforceable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	847	The statutory bar on its enforcement extended to FCT 's right to recover the total sum payable on redemption , which included the principal as well as interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	848	That is what the statute provides . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	849	I do not think that it is open to us to say that Parliament did not contemplate that the effect of this provision , which was to disable the creditor from recovering the principal of the sum lent as well as the interest on it , might be to enrich the borrower . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	850	Once that position is reached , the position is clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	851	The court can not override the statutory provision by substituting a common law remedy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	852	122 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	853	As Lord Hoffmann pointed out in Dimond at p 398 , the conclusion which he reached in that case was consistent with previous authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	854	In Orakpo v Manson Investments Ltd -LSB- 1978 -RSB- AC 95 the transaction entered into under which loans were made to enable the borrower to acquire and develop certain properties were held to be unenforceable under sections 6 and 13 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Moneylenders Act 1927 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	855	The effect was to enrich the borrower , who had fallen into arrears of payments of interest and moneys due but was successful in his defence that all the transactions including those which provided security rights to the creditor were unenforceable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	856	Lord Diplock observed that , while the Moneylenders ' Acts were designed to protect unsophisticated borrowers from being overreached by unscrupulous moneylenders , they were capable of being used by unscrupulous borrowers to avoid paying their just debts to moneylenders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	857	He considered whether a remedy in subrogation to redress the unjust enrichment might be available . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	858	But he concluded that , much as he should have liked to have done so , it was not open to him to mitigate the harshness to the moneylender and the undeserved enrichment of the borrower which had resulted from the technical failure to observe the provisions of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	859	123 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	860	In my opinion the same result must follow in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	861	I would be reluctant to say that the enrichment of Mrs Wilson was an unjustified enrichment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	862	There is no doubt that she has received a benefit which can not be justified on legal grounds at the expense of the creditor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	863	But section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1974 Act too , like sections 6 and 13 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1927 Act , was designed to protect unsophisticated borrowers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	864	There is no doubt that they would be exposed to the risk of harassment by unscrupulous creditors if creditors could override the statute by appealing to the common law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
149	865	I would prefer to say that it would be inconsistent with the statute to provide FCT with a common law remedy to redress the enrichment which Mrs Wilson has received at its expense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN

149	871	125 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	872	This exceptional appeal raises important questions under two distinct heads , the first relating to the proper construction of the Human Rights Act 1998 and the second regarding the use of parliamentary materials , specifically Hansard , in relation to questions arising under the provisions contained in Schedule 1 to the Act defining the Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	873	The facts which gave rise to the original litigation have been set out in the Opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead as have the relevant dates and the unusual procedural history leading to this appeal which has been argued not by either of the original parties but by other interests . 	lord hobhouse	lord nicholls	factagr	0.6	NAN
149	874	The House has also had the valuable assistance of counsel acting as amici curi ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	875	The Human Rights Act 1988 : 126 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	876	Although the main question of construction is to decide to what extent -LRB- if at all -RRB- the Act has retrospective effect , the first task is to examine the structure of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	877	The Act does not simply say , as do some comparable Acts -LRB- eg s. 1 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 -RRB- , that the provisions of the European Convention `` shall have the force of law '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	878	Its approach is more subtle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	879	It has a limited definition of ` Convention rights ' : s. 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	880	It requires courts in determining a question in connection with a Convention right to `` take into account '' judgments of the European Court of Human Rights and other cognate material : s. 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	881	It thus , at the outset , draws a distinction between the international obligations of the United Kingdom under the Convention and what are to be the municipal law obligations of the three organs of the state , the Executive , the Legislature and the Judiciary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	882	So far as the Convention is concerned such distinctions are in principle irrelevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	883	If the provisions of the Convention have been broken , the relevant state is in breach and no further analysis is required . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	884	The Act , on the other hand , follows a scheme which recognises that the role of the Judiciary is to apply and enforce the ` Convention rights ' municipally , treats the executive branch of government , in the form of any public authority , as being civilly liable for any breach of the ` Convention rights ' on its part and makes their offending conduct unlawful , and recognises that laws passed by the Legislature may be incompatible with a ` Convention right ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	885	Each of the three aspects of government are treated differently in the Act -LRB- though not in the Convention -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	886	But there is one complicating factor to which I must return later - the inclusion of courts in the definition of `` public authority '' : s. 6 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	887	127 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	888	The Legislature , s. 4 : In order to preserve the traditional supremacy of Parliament in the constitution of the United Kingdom , legislation can not be invalidated by the Act even if it is incompatible with the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	889	This involves a recognition that the United Kingdom can , by reason of legislation on the statute book , be in breach of the Convention if Parliament should so choose and it is the statute which must be upheld and applied by the Judiciary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	890	This situation is further confirmed by s. 4 -LRB- 6 -RRB- and s. 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	891	A declaration of incompatibility under s. 4 is thus unique . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	892	It has no effect in law except to provide a minister with the opportunity , by way of delegated legislation , to use the powers conferred by s. 10 and Schedule 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	893	Section 4 is different in character from any of the other provisions of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	894	It does not have as its subject matter the rights or obligations of any person in municipal law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	895	It does not even affect the rights of the parties before the court at the time : s. 4 -LRB- 6 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	896	It merely contains a provision enabling - the word used is `` may '' - the court , should it think fit , to make a declaration about the current state of the statute law of this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	897	The declaration applies only to the present : s. 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and s. 4 -LRB- 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	898	If the legislation in question has been amended or repealed no question of a declaration under s. 4 can arise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	899	Section 4 involves no retrospectivity and there is therefore always jurisdiction to make a declaration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	900	But it is unlikely that a court will make a declaration when it would be wholly gratuitous and , in such a case , the point probably would not have been argued and s. 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- probably would not be satisfied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	901	The course adopted by the Court of Appeal in the present case , raising the question of incompatibility of its own motion when the parties had not , was in my view a work of supererogation and improper . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	902	128 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	903	The Legislature , s. 3 : Section 3 has a different character although it again deals with legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	904	It does change the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	905	It does change the parties ' rights and obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	906	Before the 1998 Act came into force , legislation had to be construed applying the ordinary canons of construction : the legislation would therefore have the legal effect ` x ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	907	After the 1998 Act came into force , the same legislation may , because of the requirement that `` so far as it is possible '' the legislation `` must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights '' , have legal effect ` y ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	908	Conduct that was lawful before may become unlawful and unlawful conduct may become lawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	909	A right or liberty that someone did not have before may be granted to them by the operation of s. 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- when it came into force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	910	Section 3 therefore has raised a question of retrospectivity answered in R v Lambert -LSB- 2001 -RSB- UKHL 62 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- AC 545 and R v Kansal -LRB- No. 2 -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- UKHL 62 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- AC 69 , per Lord Hope at p. 112 . 	lord hobhouse	lord hope	partagr	0.6	NAN
149	911	129 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	912	But confusion has been created by the dual relevance of s. 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	913	As well as the effect which I have explained in the preceding paragraph , it has a relevance to s. 4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	914	Sections 3 and 4 are both sections which came into effect on the same day , appointed under s. 22 -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	915	Therefore no question of incompatibility can arise under s. 4 without the relevant legislation being construed in accordance with s. 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	916	If s. 3 provides the answer there is no incompatibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	917	But this is not to give a retrospective effect to s. 3 any more than it is to give a retrospective effect to s. 4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	918	130 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	919	The Executive , sections 6 and 7 : Subject to certain qualifications , s. 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- makes it unlawful for the Executive to act in a way that is incompatible with a ` Convention right ' and s. 7 -LRB- 1 -RRB- empowers any victim of such unlawful conduct -LRB- or the threat of it -RRB- to take civil proceedings against the relevant authority or rely upon the ` Convention right ' in legal proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	920	This , as regards the emanations of the Executive , ie public authorities , creates legal liabilities and , for the citizen , legal rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	921	These provisions therefore do raise a potential question of retrospectivity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	922	S. 22 -LRB- 4 -RRB- makes express provision answering this question : as regards the victim defending himself against the authority in proceedings brought by the authority , the victim can rely upon his ` Convention rights ' whenever the act in question took place , but otherwise s. 7 -LRB- 1 -RRB- only applies to acts occurring after s. 7 came into force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	923	Two consequences flow from this express provision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	924	First it expressly provides a limited retrospective effect to part of s. 7 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	925	Secondly , it carries with it the clear implication that the Act in general does not have retrospective effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	926	Thus , far from permitting a view that the Act should in general be construed so as to have a retrospective effect , the conclusion is confirmed that the Act should not -LRB- save for the limited exception in s. 22 -LRB- 4 -RRB- -RRB- be construed so as to have any retrospective effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	927	131 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	928	The Judiciary , the basic principle : The Judiciary is the part of Government which has the responsibility for applying the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	929	The Convention and the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights recognise this , affirming the principles of certainty and ` legality ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	930	There is nothing in the Convention which requires the Judiciary to do anything else . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	931	But , if , in complying with and applying the municipal law , the Judiciary do not provide an outcome which is compliant with the rights of victims under the Convention , for example , by failing to recognise a right or grant an adequate remedy , the State is in breach of its Convention obligations and should change its municipal law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	932	For a court , its duty in the determination of any dispute is to determine it in accordance with the municipal law applicable to the issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	933	This may include the duty to consider whether a particular statute or statutory provision has retrospective effect or not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	934	If it does have retrospective effect , then that effect must be recognised but , if it does not , it must not be treated as determinative of the legality or legal result of earlier events or conduct , earlier , that is , than the date upon which the relevant change in the law came into effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	935	The duty I have described is the same for both the original trial court and any appeal court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	936	Just as in a case with a foreign element , it may be necessary to apply the choice of laws rules of private international law , so , in another case when there has been a change in the municipal law between the time of the relevant events or conduct and the time of trial , it may be necessary to decide whether that change had retrospective effect or not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	937	If the answer is that it did not then the change is irrelevant to the rights and liabilities of the parties -LRB- save possibly as relevant factual evidence on , say , a question of assessment of damages or causation of loss -RRB- and the position in an appellate court is the same . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	938	Article 7.1 of the Convention provides an illustration of the need to apply the municipal law as it stood at the time of the relevant conduct and the objection to later making illegal conduct which was legal at the time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	939	132 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	940	The Judiciary , Article 6 : Most of the other Articles are substantive and , in so far as they affect remedies or procedures , are dependent upon the engagement of the substantive provision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	941	But Article 6 comes into a different category : it provides a right to a fair trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	942	This is a freestanding right and applies directly to the legal process and therefore -LRB- inter alia -RRB- directly to the conduct of the Judiciary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	943	But the Article is drafted so as expressly to require that the proceedings be conducted in accordance with the law , that is to say the municipal law , in force at the relevant time - `` an independent and impartial tribunal established by law '' - `` innocent until proved guilty according to law '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	944	These phrases correspond to those used in other Articles - `` prescribed by law '' - `` in accordance with the law '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	945	Thus , once the Human Rights Act had been brought into effect , the litigant could call upon the tribunal before whom he is appearing to grant him the rights stated in Article 6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	946	But it does not follow from this that he can claim a right under the Act in respect of earlier events or conduct or hearings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	947	It is a question of the construction of the Act and whether it is to be given a retrospective effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	948	It certainly does not follow that merely because he is before a court on a later occasion , he can claim Article 6 rights in respect of some earlier hearing which took place before the Act came into force or require that the court apply s. 3 of the Act in relation to something which occurred before it came into effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	949	In any event , in the present case there has been no denial to either party of their ` Convention rights ' under Article 6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	950	133 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	951	The Judiciary , sections 6 to 8 : The inclusion of provisions relating to the Executive and to the Judiciary all under the heading ` Public authorities ' and the unqualified inclusion of courts in the definition of the term ` public authority ' do not assist the reader in making the necessary distinction between the Executive and the Judiciary and their different constitutional functions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	952	However , for present purposes and the consideration of what substantive rights were available to the original parties under the Act , the position is tolerably clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	953	The retrospective effect of sections 6 and 7 are dictated by s. 22 -LRB- 4 -RRB- : no retrospective effect is available in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	954	Section 8 makes provision governing the remedies that a court may grant for a breach of a ` Convention right ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	955	One can conceive of exceptional circumstances where Article 6 might apply and might therefore give rise to a liability without more under s. 8 such as the summary committal of a person for contempt in the face of the court without a fair hearing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	956	But , where a ` judicial act ' is concerned , s. 9 provides that the remedy is to be by way of appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	957	In other words any substantive breach or any failure to provide a fair hearing or to provide an adequate remedy within the confines of s. 8 , must be challenged by appealing the decision complained about . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	958	On the appeal , the substantive question will remain as it was in the lower court applying , in accordance with the basic principle I have identified earlier , the municipal law in force at the time of the events or conduct complained of or to be applied to it by reason of some later statutory provision having retrospective effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	959	The time at which the appeal is heard is irrelevant ; equally irrelevant is which of the parties it is that has appealed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	960	134 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	961	On this point as well the Court of Appeal was mistaken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	962	The fact that the appeal was being heard after the Act had come into force did not alter what they had to decide or the municipal law which governed the dispute between the parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	963	135 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	964	Under these circumstances I will take the remaining points argued on the appeal relatively shortly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	965	Incompatibility : 136 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	966	The relevant Article is Article 1 of the First Protocol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	967	The complaint of those arguing for incompatibility is that the provisions of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 denied the lender its ` Convention rights ' under this Article . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	968	I agree with your Lordships that they did not but my reasoning is not wholly the same . 	lord hobhouse	all	partagr	0.6	NAN
149	969	The evidence of what really happened in the material transaction is exiguous and I recognise that the Article may have been engaged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	970	The transaction purported to be a transaction of pledge , that is to say , a transaction where the possession of a chattel of the borrower is given to and retained by the lender as security for the repayment of the money lent together with agreed interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	971	So long as the loan has not been repaid the pledgee has a special title in the chattel which is in his possession , by virtue of that possession . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	972	At common law the pledgee can thus sue if his possession is wrongfully interfered with , even by the owner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	973	Dishonestly to deprive the pledgee of the possession of the chattel is theft -LRB- formerly larceny -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	974	Therefore , s. 65 of the 1974 Act has the potential to deprive the pledgee of his special property in the pledged chattel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	975	It follows that s. 65 may deprive the pledgee of one of its possessions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	976	137 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	977	Whether or not this is what actually occurred in the instant case is , for me at least , still not clear but I will proceed on the assumption that there was a true pledge involving a transfer of the possession of the motor car from the borrower to the lenders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	978	The documentation purported to evidence a contract of pledge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	979	On this basis , the lenders were seeking to exercise the rights of a person in possession of a chattel and were being prevented from doing so by s. 65 so as , in effect , to deprive them of their possession of the motor car and there would be the basis for an Article 1 complaint . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	980	If , on the other hand , she actually remained in possession of the motor car throughout , the complaint of the lenders would be that they should have been allowed to seize the motor car from her after she defaulted and sell it to reduce or discharge her indebtedness to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	981	This would have been merely the purported enforcement of a claimed contractual right which the lenders had never in truth validly acquired , Article 1 would never have been engaged and that would be the short answer to the complaint . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	982	138 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	983	On the basis that Article 1 was engaged , does the Consumer Credit Act 1974 go beyond what is justifiable under that Article ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	984	For the reasons already given by your Lordships , I consider that it did not . 	lord hobhouse	all	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	985	The relevant provisions of the Act are a legitimate exercise in consumer protection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	986	Borrowers are vulnerable and not on an equal footing with lenders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	987	The Act legitimately regulates the transparency and recording of the terms of the loan transaction and makes provision for the clear obtaining of the borrower 's informed consent to those terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	988	Any such Act would have to provide effective sanctions against the lender for any failure to comply with the requirements of the Act otherwise they will be liable to be flouted , as occurred in the instant case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	989	The values to which the legislative provisions were applied were appropriate to consumer legislation , indeed arguably low , and the rates of interest chargeable , so far as your Lordships were told , unlimited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	990	-LRB- In the instant case - a secured loan of some # 5,000 - the rate of interest claimed worked out at 99.66 % pa . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	991	The Act , as a matter of policy , places a strong emphasis on the clarity and transparency of the actual transaction and , although in respect of other infringements a degree of latitude is allowed and the sanctions are discretionary , for the infringement involved in the instant case the sanction is automatic , as the statute makes plain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	992	It is argued that the legislature could have made the sanction discretionary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	993	Maybe . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	994	But it does not follow that the view that the sanction should here be automatic was not a permissible view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	995	There was no breach of Article 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	996	The Court of Appeal was wrong to hold the contrary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	997	The ` Hansard ' Point : 139 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	998	In Pepper v Hart -LSB- 1993 -RSB- AC 593 , the House of Lords permitted the reference to Parliamentary material , specifically Hansard , as an aid to the construction of an ambiguous , obscure or absurd statutory provision , if it would provide an authoritative and clear guide to the intended meaning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	999	Even the majority accepted that the liberty so permitted needed to be specifically confined and recognised the potential adverse consequences if it were not strictly limited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1000	Lord Mackay of Clashfern in his dissent was primarily influenced by the practical considerations -LRB- pp.614-5 -RRB- and the cost and waste of resources that the proposed liberty would entail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1001	In this he followed the view adopted 25 years earlier by Lord Reid in Beswick v Beswick -LSB- 1968 -RSB- AC at p. 74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1002	But , as is recognised by the passages quoted by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in Pepper v Hart at p. 632 , there are further objections to the liberty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1003	One is that the constitutional means by which laws are made is by the entry of a statute in the statute book . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1004	The source of the new law is the document itself not what anyone may have said about it or some earlier form of it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1005	Still less is it what the Executive says about it or some individual member of a House of Parliament may have said about it in the course of its passage through Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1006	As Mr Sumption QC pointed out in his submissions , it is a fundamental error of principle to confuse what a minister or a parliamentarian may have said -LRB- or said he intended -RRB- with the will and intention of Parliament itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1007	Likewise , it is another fundamental principle that the verbal expression of the law be certain , whatever difficulties in interpretation the words used may cause . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1008	Once one departs from the text of the statute construed as a whole and looks for expressions of intention to be found elsewhere , one is not looking for the intention of the Legislature but that of some other source with no constitutional power to make law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1009	The process of statutory construction/interpretation is objective not subjective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1010	These points are clearly made in the citations made by Lord-Browne-Wilkinson -LRB- vs -RRB- from Lord Wilberforce , Lord Diplock and Lord Scarman . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1011	The principles are also fully familiar -LRB- mutatis mutandis -RRB- to commercial lawyers in deciding what was the bargain struck between two commercial parties by a written agreement : see , for example , Lord Wilberforce in Reardon Smith v Hansen-Tangen -LSB- 1976 -RSB- 1 WLR 789 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1012	140 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1013	Mr Sumption did not seek to challenge the authority of the Pepper v Hart decision nor did he found upon any argument of breach of Parliamentary privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1014	He founded upon two criticisms of the Court of Appeal 's approach to the Parliamentary material and the use they made of it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1015	He criticised the confusion of the intention of individual members of Parliament with the intention of Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1016	He was quite right to do so and I need add nothing to what I have already said . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1017	He also criticised what he submitted was an extension of the application of the Pepper v Hart decision from a narrowly defined matter of statutory construction to an investigation of the justification for the inclusion of a particular provision in an Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1018	He submitted that Pepper v Hart should be confined to its actual subject matter , a taxation statute where , as he put it , the Executive had made statements about what use they would make of the relevant provisions and so gave rise to a quasi-estoppel -LRB- sic -RRB- by which they would be bound . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1019	Perhaps a better way of making the point would be to say that the executive had created a legitimate expectation which they must honour . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1020	Insofar as Mr Sumption argues against making any extension to the Pepper v Hart decision or relaxing the strict observation of the safeguards which it included , I need no persuasion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1021	Judicial experience has taught me , particularly since I was appointed a member of this House , that the attempt by advocates to use Parliamentary material from Hansard as an aid to statutory construction has not proved helpful and the fears of those pessimists who saw it as simply a cause of additional expense in the conduct of litigation have been proved correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1022	141 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1023	But on the directly pertinent question of what material it is proper for a Court to be referred to when it has to decide a question of proportionality or justification in relation the ` Convention rights ' scheduled to the Human Rights Act 1998 , it is necessary to consider what his argument really amounts to . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1024	On this I agree wholly with your Lordships and will take the point more shortly than would otherwise be the case . 	lord hobhouse	all	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1025	Whether a particular statutory provision offends against any of the ` Convention rights ' is an objective question to be answered having regard to all relevant evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1026	It is a task which Parliament itself has by the 1998 Act required the courts to perform . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
149	1027	It involves no breach of Parliamentary privilege or protocol even if it leads to a declaration that the legislation is incompatible under s. 4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1028	The argument that the courts when they apply and give effect to the 1998 Act are frustrating the will of Parliament is a travesty of the true position : they are giving effect to the will of Parliament expressed in the 1998 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1029	142 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1030	The questions of justification and proportionality involve a sociological assessment - an assessment of what are the needs of society . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1031	This in part involves a legal examination of the content and legal effect of the relevant provision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1032	But it also involves consideration of what is the mischief , social evil , danger etc which it is designed to deal with . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1033	Often these matters may already be within the knowledge of the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1034	But equally there will almost always be other evidentially valuable material which can be placed before the court which is relevant , such as reports that have been made , statistics that have been collected , and so on . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1035	Oral witnesses may have important evidence to give . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1036	To exclude such evidential material from the case merely because it is to be found in some statement made in Parliament is clearly wrong , particularly if ministerial statements made outside Parliament were already being relied on . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1037	This has nothing to do with investigating or questioning the will of Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1038	Parliament has spoken by passing the relevant Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1039	The evidence is admitted because it relates to making the required sociological assessment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1040	It has long been the case that ministerial statements made in the House may be referred to when they are relevant to a question to be determined by a court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1041	An example which immediately comes to mind is the ministerial statements concerning immigration policy which used to be made at the time when immigration law was largely extra-statutory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1042	So the broader submission of Mr Sumption which would exclude access to any such material must be rejected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1043	143 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1044	But it is easy to understand why it was that Mr Sumption 's clients thought it necessary to intervene . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1045	The Court of Appeal , having decided that they must consider s. 4 and that Article 1 was engaged , then entered upon a process of scrutinising what had been said in Parliament as reported in Hansard to see whether it disclosed any justification they were prepare to accept for the relevant provisions of the 1974 Act at the time they were enacted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1046	This was an unacceptable approach and likely to give rise to abuse . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1047	It is not part of the duty of any member of Parliament to provide or state definitively in Parliament the justification for legislation which the Legislature is content to pass . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1048	Still less was it the duty of anyone in 1974 to anticipate the passing of the 1998 Act twenty four years later . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1049	I agree that that use of Hansard for that purpose has been rightly objected to . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1050	144 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1051	There is a further important error in the Court of Appeal 's approach which may be of greater significance in other cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1052	The question of justification and proportionality has to be answered by reference to the time the events took place to which the statutory provision is being applied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1053	The person claiming to be a victim has to show how he has been affected by the provision he complains about . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1054	Those who are seeking to justify the use of the statutory provision have to do so as at the time of that use . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1055	If they can not justify it at that time , their use of it is a breach of the victim 's ` Convention rights ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1056	That is how the European Court would decide the question and it is also how the municipal court is required to look at it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1057	In most cases the difference will probably be academic and it no doubt was so regarded in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1058	But as circumstances change so the justification or the absence of it may change . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1059	Merely to examine the situation at the time the Act in question was passed and treat that as decisive is wrong in principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1060	The same point can be seen equally clearly in relation to a question of compatibility arising under s. 4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1061	As I have explained earlier , the decision under s. 4 has to be made as at the time of the decision ; just as the current state of the legislation at that time is what has to be the subject matter of the decision so also the circumstances and social needs existing at that time are what is relevant , not those existing at some earlier or different time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1062	To look for justification only in the Parliamentary debates at the time the statute was originally passed invites error . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN

149	1069	Introduction 146 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1070	This appeal is brought by the Secretary of State . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1071	She appeals against the declaration of incompatibility contained in the order of the Court of Appeal dated 2 May 2001 -LRB- as amended on 12 June 2001 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1072	Neither the claimant in the litigation , Mrs Penelope Wilson , nor the defendant , First County Trust Ltd -LRB- `` FCT '' -RRB- has taken any part in this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1073	Nonetheless an array of counsel have appeared before your Lordships representing the Secretary of State , the Finance and Leasing Association , three leading insurance companies , the Speaker of the House of Commons and the Clerk of the Parliaments and , in addition , an amicus curi ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1074	The circumstances in which this has come about are set out in the opinions of my noble and learned friends , Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Hope of Craighead , and I need not repeat them . 	lord scott	lord nicholls	factagr	0.7	NAN
149	1074	The circumstances in which this has come about are set out in the opinions of my noble and learned friends , Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Hope of Craighead , and I need not repeat them . 	lord scott	lord hope	factagr	0.7	NAN
149	1075	The issues which have necessitated this appeal and have led to the representation to which I have referred include issues of commercial and of constitutional importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1076	147 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1077	The issues have arisen out of a simple moneylending transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1078	Under an agreement made in January 1999 FCT lent Mrs Wilson # 5000 for six months on the security of her motor car . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1079	The agreement was a ` regulated agreement ' within the meaning of section 8 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1080	Section 61 of the Act requires a document containing all the `` prescribed terms '' of a regulated agreement to be signed by the debtor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1081	One of the prescribed terms is `` the amount of the credit '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1082	FCT charged Mrs Wilson , inter alia , a # 250 fee but , by agreement between them , the # 250 was not paid by Mrs Wilson but instead was added to the # 5000 to be repaid by her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1083	In the document presented by FCT to Mrs Wilson for signing , and signed by her accordingly , `` the amount of the credit '' was stated to be # 5250 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1084	But the # 250 was `` an item entering into the total charge for credit '' -LRB- see section 9 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the Act -RRB- and , accordingly , was not part of `` the amount of the credit '' -LRB- see Schedule 6 to the 1983 Regulations : SI 1983 No 1553 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1085	In short , the document signed by Mrs Wilson did not , in the respect I have mentioned , contain the prescribed terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1086	148 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1087	Mrs Wilson did not repay the loan , or pay the # 250 fee , and claimed back her car which she had deposited with FCT as security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1088	She contended that the loan agreement was unenforceable against her and that under section 113 of the Act she was entitled to have her car back . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1089	The case was heard in the county court and on 14 September 1999 judgment was given in favour of FCT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1090	Mrs Wilson then appealed to the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1091	149 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1092	The events to which I have referred took place after the Human Rights Act 1998 had been enacted but before the Act had come into force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1093	The Act came into force on 2 October 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1094	Mrs Wilson 's appeal was heard in November 2000 and was successful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1095	She obtained a declaration that the loan agreement with FCT under which she had received # 5000 was unenforceable by FCT and an order for repayment by FCT , with interest , of the sum of # 6900 that she had paid to redeem her car . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1096	But the Court of Appeal took the view that this result of the application of the relevant provisions of the 1974 Act might arguably be incompatible with the rights of FCT under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights or under Article 1 of the 1st Protocol to the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1097	So they directed the requisite notice to be given to the Secretary of State -LRB- see section 5 of the 1998 Act -RRB- and adjourned the appeal in order for the point to be argued . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1098	An amicus curi ' was appointed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1099	150 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1100	The renewed hearing of the appeal took place in March 2001 and in a judgment given on 2 May 2001 the Court of Appeal concluded that section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1974 Act , which prevented the court from enforcing a loan agreement unless a document containing all the prescribed terms had been signed by the debtor , was incompatible with FCT 's rights under Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of the 1st Protocol to the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1101	In reaching this conclusion the Court of Appeal examined and commented upon the contents of the Hansard reports of the deliberations in Parliament during the progress of the Bill . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1102	151 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1103	On this appeal the following broad issues arise -- 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1104	Can the court make a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the 1998 Act in relation to events which pre-dated 2 October 2000 , the date on which the Act came into force ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1105	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1106	If it can , were FCT 's Convention rights under article 6 or under article 1 of the First Protocol infringed by the relevant provisions of the 1974 Act ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1107	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1108	Was the use made by the Court of Appeal of the Hansard reports permissible ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1109	Retrospectivity 152 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1110	The Attorney General , Lord Goldsmith QC , appearing on behalf of the Secretary of State , based his submissions on this issue on a simple , and plainly correct , proposition , namely , that prior to 2 October 2000 FCT had had no Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1111	The 1998 Act , under which Convention rights became rights enforceable under domestic law , was not yet in force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1112	The loan transaction between FCT and Mrs Wilson had taken place in 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1113	So , at the time the loan was made and at the time Mrs Wilson 's claim for a declaration that the loan was unenforceable against her and for the return of her car -LRB- or repayment of the sum she had had to pay FCT to get it back -RRB- was tried in the county court , the 1998 Act and Convention rights were irrelevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1114	They could not affect the rights and liabilities of FCT and Mrs Wilson respectively under the loan agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1115	There can be no dispute but that this was the position prior to 2 October 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1116	153 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1117	It is , of course , open to Parliament , if it chooses to do so , to enact legislation which alters the mutual rights and obligations of citizens arising out of events which predate the enactment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1118	But in general Parliament does not choose to do so for the reason that to legislate so as to alter the legal consequences of events that have already taken place is likely to produce unfair or unjust results . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1119	Unfairness or injustice may be produced if persons who have acquired rights in consequence of past events are deprived of those rights by subsequent legislation ; or it may be produced if persons are subjected on account of those past events to liabilities that they were not previously subject to . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1120	There is , therefore , a common law presumption that a statute is not intended to have a retrospective effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1121	This presumption is part of a broader presumption that Parliament does not intend a statute to have an unfair or unjust effect -LRB- see Maxwell on Statutes , 12th edition p 215 and Bennion 's Statutory Interpretation , 4th edition pp 265-266 and 689-690 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1122	The presumption can be rebutted if it sufficiently clearly appears that it was indeed the intention of Parliament to produce the result in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1123	The presumption is no more than a starting point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1124	154 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1125	The question , therefore , is whether Parliament intended the 1998 Act and the Convention rights thereby incorporated into domestic law to be applied to transactions and events predating the coming into force of the Act and so as to alter the legal consequences of those transactions and events ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1126	155 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1127	Sections 3 and 4 of the 1998 Act are , in my opinion , neutral . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1128	Section 3 requires that `` So far as it is possible to do so , primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1129	The 1974 Act must be so read . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1130	Section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- says that `` If the court is satisfied that the provision -LSB- of primary legislation -RSB- is incompatible with a Convention right , it may make a declaration of that incompatibility '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1131	These statutory provisions do not , in my opinion , assist one way or the other in answering the question whether Parliament intended the Act to be applicable to past transactions and events . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1132	At the least it may be said that they contain nothing to displace the presumption that Parliament did not so intend . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1133	156 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1134	Section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act says that `` It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1135	And sub-section -LRB- 3 -RRB- says that a `` public authority '' includes `` a court or tribunal '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1136	It is plain that section 6 is looking to the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1137	It is not purporting to make unlawful a pre 2 October 2000 act of a public authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1138	It was section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- on which the Court of Appeal relied in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1139	The reasoning proceeded like this -- -LRB- i -RRB- the Court of Appeal is a public authority -LRB- see sub-section -LRB- 3 -RRB- -RRB- ; -LRB- ii -RRB- it is unlawful for a public authority , and therefore for the Court of Appeal , to act in a way incompatible with a Convention right ; -LRB- iii -RRB- if the relevant provisions of the 1974 Act are incompatible with a Convention right it is therefore unlawful for the Court of Appeal to give effect to them ; -LRB- iv -RRB- the Court of Appeal is bound , by section 3 , to try to read down the relevant provisions of the 1974 Act so as to render them compatible with the Convention ; and -LRB- v -RRB- if that reading down is not possible , the Court of Appeal may make a declaration of incompatibility -LRB- see section 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1140	This reasoning does not confront the issue of retrospectivity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1141	It avoids it by concluding that if the trial , or , as in the present case , the appeal , takes place after 2 October 2000 , the court is bound by section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- to apply the 1998 Act without regard to whether the transactions or events in question predate or postdate the coming into force of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1142	157 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1143	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1144	in my opinion , this conclusion can not be accepted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1145	The function of the court in civil litigation between private citizens is to adjudicate on their rights and obligations in issue in the case and to grant the relief , if any , requisite to reflect those rights and obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1146	If the rights and obligations of the parties require a particular result to be reached , whether by dismissal of the action , an award of damages , the making of a declaration , the grant of an injunction , or otherwise , it is the duty of the court to deal with the case accordingly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1147	For the court to do so can not be an unlawful act under section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1148	158 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1149	The retrospectivity issue in this case is whether the coming into force of the 1998 Act on 2 October 2000 has altered the rights and obligations inter se of FCT and Mrs Wilson arising out of their loan transaction in 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1150	Let it be supposed that the relevant provisions of the 1974 Act are , prima facie , inconsistent with the Convention rights of moneylenders ; but let it be supposed also that the inconsistent provisions can be read down so as to give the court a discretion to enforce a loan agreement notwithstanding that a document containing the prescribed terms had not been signed by the borrower . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1151	On that footing , a loan agreement post-dating 2 October 2000 would , subject to the court 's discretion under section 127 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , be enforceable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1152	But would a loan agreement pre-dating 2 October 2000 be similarly enforceable ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1153	Only if the Act were to be given a retrospective effect would that be so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1154	If the Act is not to be given a retrospective effect , if the pre 2 October 2000 rights and liabilities of lender and borrower are not altered by the coming into effect of the Act , then it would be the duty of the court , post 2 October 2000 as before , to hold the loan agreement to be unenforceable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1155	In so holding the court would not be committing an unlawful act under section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- for in relation to the pre-2 October 2000 transaction the parties would have no Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1156	159 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1157	Section 7 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the 1998 Act says that a person who claims that a public authority has acted in a way which is made unlawful by section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- may bring proceedings against the authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1158	Section 9 says that proceedings under section 7 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- in respect of a judicial act may be brought only by exercising a right of appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1159	But every appeal court , including your Lordship 's House , must , in dealing with an appeal , give effect to the rights and obligations of the parties in issue on the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1160	If these rights and obligations arise out of pre 2 October 2000 events , the appeal court is no more entitled than the court below to alter the parties ' rights and obligations in order to give effect to a reading down of some relevant statutory provision unless the conclusion is justified that the 1998 Act was intended to have that retrospective effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1161	160 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1162	The only positive indication as to whether or not the 1998 Act was intended to have retrospective effect is to be found in section 22 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1163	Section 22 -LRB- 4 -RRB- says that section 7 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- applies to proceedings brought by or at the instigation of a public authority whenever the act in question took place but that otherwise sub-section -LRB- 1 -RRB- does not apply to acts taking place before 2 October 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1164	This express indication of a specific retrospective effect that the Act was to have in relation to proceedings brought by a public authority is , in my opinion , a fair indication that in no other respect was the Act intended to have a retrospective effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1165	161 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1166	The arguments against allowing the Act to have a general retrospective effect seem to me very powerful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1167	The legal consequences under the civil law of a transaction or of events ought to be established by reference to the law at the time they take place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1168	When events apt to create rights or obligations take place citizens affected by the events need to be able to ascertain the extent of their rights or obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1169	They can not do so if subsequent legislation may add to or diminish those rights or obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1170	Where transactions calculated to continue for some considerable period are entered into , intervening legislation may in some respect or other affect the rights and obligations that accrue under the transaction after the legislation has come into force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1171	Landlord and tenant legislation is a good example . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1172	If a lease is granted for , say , 99 years , there might well be intervening legislation capable of affecting the ability of the landlord to forfeit the lease , to operate a rent review clause , to claim damages for dilapidations or to recover possession on the expiry of the term . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1173	But it would be unusual for the legislation to alter the rights and obligations of the parties resulting from events that had already taken place , such as a forfeiture notice already served , a damages claim already instituted , rent review machinery already in train , and so on . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1174	However , whatever may be the position where there is an on-going transaction and intervening legislation , the present case involves a simple six-month loan transaction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1175	All the relevant events , bar the completion of the appeal process , pre-dated the coming into effect of the 1998 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1176	There is nothing to rebut the presumption that Parliament did not intend the Act to operate retrospectively so as to alter accrued rights or to impose obligations where none previously existed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1177	162 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1178	In my opinion , therefore , the Court of Appeal were in error in endeavouring to apply the 1998 Act to the loan transaction between FCT and Mrs Wilson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN

149	1181	My reasons are , I believe , substantially the same as those expressed by my noble and learned friends , Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead , Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry , with which I respectfully agree . 	lord scott	lord rodger	fullagr	0.7	NAN
149	1182	Is section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1974 Act compatible with the Convention ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1183	163 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1184	The loan agreement between FCT and Mrs Wilson was an `` improperly executed regulated agreement '' because the document signed by Mrs Wilson misstated the amount of the credit and so did not contain all the prescribed terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
149	1185	That is common ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1186	164 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1187	Section 65 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1974 Act says that an `` improperly executed regulated agreement is enforceable against the debtor ... on an order of the court only '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1188	It is to be noted that the agreement is not void or unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1189	It is merely unenforceable except on an order of the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1190	Section 127 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act says , inter alia , that in the case of an application for an enforcement order under section 65 -LRB- 1 -RRB- the court `` shall dismiss the application if , but -LRB- subject to subsections -LRB- 3 -RRB- and -LRB- 4 -RRB- -RRB- only if , it considers it just to do so ... . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1191	Subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- bars the court from making an enforcement order under section 65 -LRB- 1 -RRB- in a case where there is no document containing all the prescribed terms that has been signed by the debtor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1192	So , in the present case , the court was barred by section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- from making an enforcement order in favour of FCT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1193	Its discretionary power to make an enforcement order which otherwise would have been conferred by subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- had been excluded by subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1194	165 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1195	It was contended before your Lordships that section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- infringed article 6 of the Convention in that FCT was denied recourse to the court for the determination of the question whether the loan agreement should be enforced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1196	This , in my opinion , is an impossible contention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1197	Article 6 , as each of my noble and learned friends has observed , provides a procedural guarantee of the right to have issues judicially determined . 	lord scott	all	partagr	0.8	NAN
149	1198	Article 6 is not concerned with the substantive law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1199	True it is that the loan agreement between FCT and Mrs Wilson was a valid , lawful agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1200	But the 1974 Act declared it to be unenforceable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1201	Whatever the divide between substantive law and procedural law , and I respectfully agree that the line is sometimes difficult to draw , there is no doubt at all but that section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- is a provision of substantive law denying the loan agreement the quality of enforceability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1202	166 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1203	Mr Hibbert counsel for the Finance and Leasing Association submitted that any statutory provision that rendered a valid agreement unenforceable infringed article 6 of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1204	The extravagance of this submission became apparent when he extended it to contracts for the sale of land . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1205	If his submission were right it would follow that the familiar statutory provisions rendering contracts for the sale of land unenforceable unless in writing would be incompatible with article 6 Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1206	In agreement with all of your Lordships I would reject the article 6 submissions . 	lord scott	all	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1207	167 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1208	Reliance was placed , in the alternative , on article 1 of the First Protocol . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1209	Section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- , it was submitted , deprived FCT of its right to enforce repayment of the # 5000 loan and thereby deprived it of its `` possessions '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1210	The deprivation was , it was argued , disproportionate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1211	I would , for my part , reject the article 1 of the First Protocol point on two grounds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1212	168 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1213	First , article 1 of the First Protocol is directed to interference with existing possessions or property rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1214	FCT never had , at any stage in the history of the loan agreement , the right to enforce against Mrs Wilson the repayment of the # 5000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1215	Neither the 1974 Act as a whole nor section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- in particular constituted an interference with a pre-existing right of FCT to enforce repayment by Mrs Wilson of the # 5000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1216	The Act , and section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- prevented FCT from ever possessing that right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1217	No authority has been cited to your Lordships for the proposition that a statutory provision which prevents a transaction from having the quality of legal enforceability can be regarded as an interference for article 1 purposes with the possessions of the party who would have benefited if the transaction had had that quality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1218	In my opinion , the proposition should be rejected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1219	169 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1220	Second , the purpose or policy underlying the statutory bar on enforceability of a regulated loan agreement where no document containing all the prescribed terms has been signed by the debtor can not , in my opinion , be categorised as disproportionate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1221	The need to control moneylending transactions is as old as our civilization and I know of no legal system that has not imposed such controls . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1222	Indeed in some legal systems any lending of money on interest terms is barred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1223	In this country there were strict statutory controls under the Moneylenders Acts 1900 to 1927 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1224	The 1974 Act represented a relaxation of the rigidity of the controls . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1225	The discretion allowed to the courts by section 127 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act was not to be found in its predecessors -LRB- see section 6 of the 1927 Act -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1226	These controls recognise the vulnerability of those members of the public who resort to pawnbrokers and moneylenders when in dire need of funds to make ends meet . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1227	They are open to exploitation ; their bargaining power is minimal ; their understanding of legal procedures and remedies is likely to be sparse . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1228	They need protection and part of the protection is the insistence by the Act that the `` prescribed terms '' , representing the important terms of the loan transaction , must be set out in a document to be signed by the debtor if the repayment of the loan is to be enforceable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1229	I do not accept that this protection , harshly though it may in some cases bear upon lenders , is disproportionate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1230	170 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1231	In my opinion , even if the 1998 Act were applicable to the loan transaction between FCT and Mrs Wilson there would have been no infringement of FCT 's Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1232	171 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1233	One of the sub-issues argued before your Lordships was whether , when considering whether the provisions of the 1974 Act infringed FCT 's Convention rights , the court should take into account other legal remedies which might be available to FCT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1234	It was argued that under the general law a restitutionary remedy was available to FCT enabling recovery of at least the # 5000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1235	I am not clear whether the proposed remedy would be a common law remedy for money had and received or an equitable remedy based on Mrs Wilson 's unjust enrichment , but identifying the correct description of the remedy is not for present purposes important . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1236	172 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1237	My Lords there can , in my opinion , be no doubt at all but that in considering whether section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- , in rendering the # 5000 loan unenforceable , constitutes an infringement of FCT 's Convention rights , FCT 's remedies in the round must be taken into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1238	If FCT is able under the general law to recover the # 5000 by some means other than suing on the debt , the 1974 Act provisions preventing FCT from suing on the debt could not on any argument constitute an infringement of FCT 's Article 1 rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1239	But it is , in my opinion , equally clear that no such alternative means of recovery are available to FCT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1240	The decisions of this House in Orakpo v Manson Investments Ltd -LSB- 1978 -RSB- AC 95 and , more recently , Dimond v Lovell -LSB- 2002 -RSB- AC 384 stand in the way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1241	Parliament 's intention in enacting section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1974 Act was to make a loan , made under a regulated agreement , unenforceable in certain events . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1242	The courts can not defeat that intention by allowing some alternative means of recovery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1243	Use of Hansard 173 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1244	On this issue I am in complete agreement with , and can not usefully add anything to , what has been said by my noble and learned friend , Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead . 	lord scott	lord nicholls	NAN	0.8	NAN

149	1249	On 9 November 1998 the Human Rights Act 1998 -LRB- `` the 1998 Act '' -RRB- received the Royal Assent and , some twenty-three months later , on 2 October 2000 it came into force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1250	The Act was intended to `` bring home '' rights under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms -LRB- `` the Convention '' -RRB- -LRB- 1953 -RRB- -LRB- Cmnd 8969 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1251	In terms of section 1 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , the Convention rights listed in the schedule have effect for the purposes of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1252	The main effect is to give people remedies in the domestic law of the United Kingdom if public authorities infringe their Convention rights - the so-called `` vertical effect '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1253	The extent to which the Act also operates between private individuals - the so-called `` horizontal effect '' - is controversial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1254	But it is recognised that , since courts are public authorities for purposes of the Act , a court order pronounced against one private party at the instigation of another may potentially infringe the first party 's Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1255	If giving effect to a Convention right under the Act means that the order has to be refused or modified , then that affects the rights of the party who sought it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1256	The Facts 175 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1257	The present is said to be an example of that kind of case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1258	Since my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead has given a full account of the facts , I need mention only the most important . 	lord rodger	lord nicholls	factagr	0.8	NAN
149	1259	In 1999 Mrs Wilson entered into a loan agreement with First County Trust Ltd -LRB- `` First County '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1260	The agreement was regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974 -LRB- `` the 1974 Act '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1261	Mrs Wilson pawned her BMW car as security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1262	Under section 61 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- , if the debtor has not signed a document in the prescribed form containing all the prescribed terms , the agreement is `` not properly executed '' , with the result that it `` is enforceable against the debtor or hirer on an order of the court only '' : section 65 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1263	More particularly , in terms of section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- , if an agreement does not contain all the prescribed terms , the court is not to make an enforcement order unless the debtor has signed a document which does contain all the prescribed terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1264	Mrs Wilson 's position was that the document in the prescribed form which she signed did not show the correct `` amount of the credit '' , one of the prescribed terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1265	Moreover , she had signed no other document containing the prescribed terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1266	As a result , by reason of section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- the court would not be able to make an enforcement order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1267	176 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1268	Section 142 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- provides that , where a thing can be done by a creditor on an enforcement order only and the creditor has not made an application for such an order , an interested party may apply to the court for a declaration and `` the court may if it thinks just make a declaration that the creditor or owner is not entitled to do that thing , and thereafter no application for an enforcement order in respect of it shall be entertained . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1269	Where the court makes such a declaration , by section 113 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- d -RRB- , section 106 is to apply to any security provided in relation to the agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1270	As a result , inter alia the security is to be treated as never having effect and any property lodged with the creditor solely for the purposes of the security is to be returned forthwith . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1271	Mrs Wilson sought a declaration which would have these effects . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1272	177 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1273	The county court judge held that the loan agreement contained all the prescribed terms and he therefore refused to make the declaration which Mrs Wilson sought . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1274	She appealed , but in the meantime paid the necessary sum to recover her car . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1275	Mrs Wilson 's appeal was heard after the 1998 Act had come into force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1276	Reversing the county court judge , the Court of Appeal held that the agreement did not contain the prescribed term in question , the `` amount of the credit '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1277	The agreement was therefore unenforceable by reason of section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1278	See -LSB- 2001 -RSB- EWCA Civ 633 ; -LSB- 2001 -RSB- QB 407 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1279	The Court of Appeal eventually went on to hold , however , that section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- infringed First County 's rights under article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Convention and article 1 of the First Protocol -LRB- `` article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- '' and `` article 1 '' respectively -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1280	Since it was not possible to `` read down '' section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- under section 3 of the 1998 Act so as to make it compatible with First County 's Convention rights , the Court of Appeal gave effect to it by ordering First County to pay back the sum which Mrs Wilson had earlier paid to them to get her car back . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1281	But the Court of Appeal also made a declaration under section 4 of the 1998 Act that section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1974 Act is incompatible with the rights guaranteed to the creditor by article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and article 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1282	See -LSB- 2002 -RSB- QB 74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1283	178 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1284	First County did not appeal , but the Secretary of State appealed , on a number of grounds , against the Court of Appeal 's order making the declaration of incompatibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1285	I respectfully agree with Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead as to the disposal of all these grounds of appeal and , in particular , with what my noble and learned friend , Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough , has said on the use of Hansard . 	lord rodger	lord nicholls	fullagr	0.8	NAN
149	1285	I respectfully agree with Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead as to the disposal of all these grounds of appeal and , in particular , with what my noble and learned friend , Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough , has said on the use of Hansard . 	lord rodger	lord hobhouse	fullagr	0.8	NAN
149	1286	I confine my observations accordingly to the one matter , `` retrospectivity '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1287	At the outset , it may be useful to recall some general features of the 1998 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1288	General features of the 1998 Act 179 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1289	The 1998 Act is beautifully drafted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1290	Its structure is tight and elegant , being marred only by the obvious interpolation of sections 12 and 13 as a result of amendments made while the Bill was passing through Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1291	The presence or absence of particular features in the Act is therefore unlikely to be due to oversight . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1292	180 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1293	Although the Act is not entrenched , the Convention rights that it confers have a peculiar potency . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1294	Enforcing them may require a court to modify the common law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1295	So far as possible , a court must read and give effect to statutory provisions in a way that is compatible with them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1296	Rights that can produce such results are clearly of a higher order than the rights which people enjoy at common law or under most other statutes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1297	181 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1298	It is well recognised , however , that Convention rights are to be seen as an expression of fundamental principles rather than as a set of mere rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1299	In applying the principles the courts must balance competing interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1300	So much was made clear , for example , by my noble and learned friend , Lord Hope of Craighead , in R v DPP , Ex p Kebilene -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 2 AC 326 , 384B - C. Therefore , when deciding whether the order sought by one private party would infringe a Convention right of the other , a court must balance the interests of both parties . 	lord rodger	lord hope	partagr	0.8	NAN
149	1301	If the court finds that the order would infringe the Convention right of the party against whom it would be made , this can only be because the court has concluded that his interests are to be preferred to any competing interests of the party seeking the order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1302	In particular , the court must have concluded that the Convention right of the party resisting the order is to be preferred to the other party 's common law or statutory right to obtain it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1303	182 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1304	The 1998 Act is unusual - perhaps unique - in its range . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1305	While most statutes apply to one particular topic or area of law , the 1998 Act works as a catalyst across the board , wherever a Convention right is engaged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1306	It may affect matters of substance in such areas as the law of property , the law of marriage and the law of torts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1307	Or else it may affect civil and criminal procedure , or the procedure of administrative tribunals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1308	183 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1309	Unlike some statutes , the 1998 Act did not arrive on the scene unheralded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1310	The Bill embodied a flagship policy of the government and the date for the commencement of the Act was announced well in advance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1311	During the long period between Royal Assent and commencement , not only the legal profession but public authorities also could prepare for the day when people would enjoy Convention rights within the three domestic legal systems and when public authorities would have to respond to that new situation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1312	184 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1313	When the 1998 Act did eventually come into force , inevitably it was in a world where events and transactions had been taking place and legal proceedings of various kinds were in progress . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1314	Naturally , questions arose as to how the new Act fitted into this world . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1315	For all but two of these questions , the draftsman has , deliberately , left it to the courts to supply the answers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1316	Although counsel confined their argument to sections 3 and 4 , for reasons which will become apparent , I consider that the issues relating to the application of these sections are best considered in the context of the 1998 Act as a whole . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1317	185 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1318	In dealing with the more general aspects of the difficult topic of `` retrospectivity '' , I have derived particular benefit from studying P-A Côté , The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada , 3rd ed -LRB- 2000 -RRB- , Chapter 2 , section 1 , and the literature cited there . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1319	The presumption against the retroactive operation of legislation 186 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1320	At common law there is a presumption that a statute does not have `` retrospective '' effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1321	The statement in Maxwell on The Interpretation of Statutes , 12th ed -LRB- 1969 -RRB- , p 215 is frequently quoted : `` Upon the presumption that the legislature does not intend what is unjust rests the leaning against giving certain statutes a retrospective operation .

149	1323	It is a fundamental rule of English law that no statute shall be construed to have a retrospective operation unless such a construction appears very clearly in the terms of the Act , or arises by necessary and distinct implication . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1324	The very generality of this statement rather obscures the fact that it uses the term `` retrospective '' to describe a range of different effects , some more and some less extreme . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

149	1327	So far as matters of substance are concerned , the essence of the core common law rule is conveniently stated by Sir Owen Dixon CJ in Maxwell v Murphy -LRB- 1957 -RRB- 96 CLR 261 , 267 : `` The general rule of the common law is that a statute changing the law ought not , unless the intention appears with reasonable certainty , to be understood as applying to facts or events that have already occurred in such a way as to confer or impose or otherwise affect rights or liabilities which the law had defined by reference to the past events . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1328	In Wainwright v Home Office -LSB- 2002 -RSB- QB 1334 , 1345F , at para 27 , Lord Woolf LCJ referred succinctly to : `` the general presumption that legislation should not be treated as changing the substantive law in relation to events taking place prior to legislation coming into force . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1329	Since statutes which change the substantive law in relation to events in the past can obviously cause serious injustice , the presumption against a statute being intended to have such an effect is powerful - so powerful indeed that any statutory provision , such as section 1 of the War Damage Act 1965 , which is intended to apply in this way can be expected to say so expressly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1330	Because such provisions do actually affect the position before the legislation came into force , they can conveniently be described as `` retroactive '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1331	Statutes making prospective changes to existing rights 188 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

149	1334	The statute book contains many statutes which are not retroactive but alter existing rights and duties - only prospectively , with effect from the date of commencement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

149	1337	The distinction between the two kinds of provision , and the need to have regard to that distinction , were spelled out by the Court of Appeal long ago in West v Gwynne -LSB- 1911 -RSB- 2 Ch 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
149	1338	In that case the plaintiffs were assignees of a lease dating from 1874 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

149	1340	Section 3 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act 1892 provided that `` In all leases containing a covenant ... against ... underletting ... the land or property leased without licence or consent , such covenant ... shall , unless the lease contains an expressed provision to the contrary , be deemed to be subject to a proviso to the effect that no fine or sum of money in the nature of a fine shall be payable for or in respect of such licence or consent ... .

149	1341	In 1909 the plaintiffs applied to the defendant landlord for his consent to a proposed underlease of part of the premises but he replied that he was prepared to grant a licence only on condition that he should receive for himself half of the sum by which the rent of the underlease exceeded the rent payable under the lease .

149	1346	Cozens-Hardy MR said this , -LSB- 1911 -RSB- 2 Ch 1 , 11 : `` It was forcibly argued by Mr Hughes that a statute is presumed not to have a retrospective operation unless the contrary appears by express language or by necessary implication . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

149	1352	I doubt whether the power to refuse consent to an assignment except upon the terms of paying a fine can fairly be called a vested right or interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1353	Upon the whole I think section 3 is a general enactment based on grounds of public policy , and I decline to construe it in such a way as to render it inoperative for many years wherever leases for 99 years , or it may be for 999 years , are in existence . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1354	Buckley LJ observed , -LSB- 1911 -RSB- 2 Ch 1 , 11 - 12 : `` During the argument the words ` retrospective ' and ` retroactive ' have been repeatedly used , and the question has been stated to be whether section 3 of the Conveyancing Act 1892 , is retrospective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1355	To my mind the word ` retrospective ' is inappropriate , and the question is not whether the section is retrospective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1356	Retrospective operation is one matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1357	Interference with existing rights is another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1358	If an Act provides that as at a past date the law shall be taken to have been that which it was not , that Act I understand to be retrospective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1359	That is not this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1360	The question here is whether a certain provision as to the contents of leases is addressed to the case of all leases or only of some , namely , leases executed after the passing of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1361	The question is as to the ambit and scope of the Act , and not as to the date as from which the new law , as enacted by the Act , is to be taken to have been the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1362	Numerous authorities have been cited to us . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1363	I shall not travel through them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1364	To my mind they have but little bearing upon this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1365	Suppose that by contract between A and B there is in an event to arise a debt from B to A , and suppose that an Act is passed which provides that in respect of such a contract no debt shall arise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1366	As an illustration take the case of a contract to pay money upon the event of a wager , or the case of an insurance against a risk which an Act subsequently declares to be one in respect of which the assured shall not have an insurable interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1367	In such a case , if the event has happened before the Act is passed , so that at the moment when the Act comes into operation a debt exists , an investigation whether the transaction is struck at by the Act involves an investigation whether the Act is retrospective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1368	Such was the point which arose in Moon v Durden -LRB- 1848 -RRB- 2 Ex 22 and in Knight v Lee -LSB- 1893 -RSB- 1 QB 41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1369	But if at the date of the passing of the Act the event has not happened , then the operation of the Act in forbidding the subsequent coming into existence of a debt is not a retrospective operation , but is an interference with existing rights in that it destroys A 's right in an event to become a creditor of B . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1370	As matter of principle an Act of Parliament is not without sufficient reason taken to be retrospective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1371	There is , so to speak , a presumption that it speaks only as to the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1372	But there is no like presumption that an Act is not intended to interfere with existing rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1373	Most Acts of Parliament , in fact , do interfere with existing rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1374	To construe this section I have simply to read it , and , looking at the Act in which it is contained , to say what is its fair meaning . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1375	191 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1376	Similarly - simplifying the complexities - in Gustavson Drilling -LRB- 1964 -RRB- Ltd v Minister of National Revenue -LSB- 1977 -RSB- 1 SCR 271 an oil exploration company was entitled to deduct certain drilling and exploration expenses when computing its income for tax purposes , but it did not do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1377	In 1962 the legislation was changed to disallow such deductions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1378	Subsequently , a successor company none the less sought to deduct those accumulated expenses and invoked the presumption against legislation having retrospective effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1379	The majority of the Supreme Court of Canada rejected the argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1380	Dickson J said , at pp 279 - 280 : `` The general rule is that statutes are not to be construed as having retrospective operation unless such a construction is expressly or by necessary implication required by the language of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1381	An amending enactment may provide that it shall be deemed to have come into force on a date prior to its enactment or it may provide that it is to be operative with respect to transactions occurring prior to its enactment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1382	In those instances the statute operates retrospectively . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1383	Superficially the present case may seem akin to the second instance but I think the true view to be that the repealing enactment in the present case , although undoubtedly affecting past transactions , does not operate retrospectively in the sense that it alters rights as of a past time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1384	The section as amended by the repeal does not purport to deal with taxation years prior to the date of the amendment ; it does not reach into the past and declare that the law or the rights of parties as of an earlier date shall be taken to be something other than they were as of that earlier date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1385	The effect , so far as the appellant is concerned , is to deny for the future a right to deduct enjoyed in the past but the right is not affected as of a time prior to enactment of the amending statute . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1386	192 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1387	Since provisions which affect existing rights prospectively are not retroactive , the presumption against retroactivity does not apply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1388	Nor is there any general presumption that legislation does not alter the existing legal situation or existing rights : the very purpose of Acts of Parliament is to alter the existing legal situation and this will often involve altering existing rights for the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1389	So , as Dickson J went on to point out in Gustavson Drilling -LSB- 1977 -RSB- 1 SCR 271 , 282 - 283 , with special reference to tax legislation : `` No one has a vested right to continuance of the law as it stood in the past ; in tax law it is imperative that legislation conform to changing social needs and governmental policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1390	A taxpayer may plan his financial affairs in reliance on the tax laws remaining the same ; he takes the risk that the legislation may be changed . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1391	As the sparks fly upward , individuals and businesses run the risk that Parliament may change the law governing their affairs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1392	Presumption against interference with vested rights 193 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1393	Often , however , a sudden change in existing rights would be so unfair to certain individuals or businesses in their particular predicament that it is to be presumed that Parliament did not intend the new legislation to affect them in that respect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1394	If undue weight is not given to his use of the term `` retrospective '' , Wright J gives a strong statement of the presumption in In re Athlumney -LSB- 1898 -RSB- 2 QB 547 , 551-552 : `` Perhaps no rule of construction is more firmly established than this - that a retrospective operation is not to be given to a statute so as to impair an existing right or obligation , otherwise than as regards matter of procedure , unless that effect can not be avoided without doing violence to the language of the enactment . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1395	Another statement of the presumption is to be found in the judgment of Dickson J in Gustavson Drilling -LSB- 1977 -RSB- 1 SCR 271 , 282 : `` The rule is that a statute should not be given a construction that would impair existing rights as regards person or property unless the language in which it is couched requires such a construction : Spooner Oils Ltd v Turner Valley Gas Conservation Board -LSB- 1933 -RSB- SCR 629 , 638 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1396	The presumption that vested rights are not affected unless the intention of the legislature is clear applies whether the legislation is retrospective or prospective in operation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1397	A prospective enactment may be bad if it affects vested rights and does not do so in unambiguous terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1398	This presumption , however , only applies where the legislation is in some way ambiguous and reasonably susceptible of two constructions . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1399	194 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1400	Dickson J here makes the important point that this presumption applies to all legislation which affects vested rights , whether the legislation affects them retroactively or only prospectively . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1401	The decision of the Privy Council in Zainal bin Hashim v Government of Malaysia -LSB- 1980 -RSB- AC 734 is an example of the presumption being considered in relation to a retroactive statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1402	195 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1403	More often , the presumption falls to be considered in relation to legislation which alters rights only for the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1404	Since it is more likely that Parliament intended to alter vested rights in this way than that it intended to make a retroactive change , in practice the presumption against legislation altering vested rights is regarded as weaker than the presumption against legislation having retroactive effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1405	196 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1406	The presumption is against legislation impairing rights that are described as `` vested '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1407	The courts have tried , without conspicuous success , to define what is meant by `` vested rights '' for this purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1408	Although it concerned a statutory rule resembling section 16 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- of the Interpretation Act 1978 , the decision of the Privy Council in Abbott v Minister for Lands -LSB- 1895 -RSB- AC 425 is often regarded as a starting-point for considering this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1409	There Lord Herschell LC indicated , at p 431 , that , to convert a mere right existing in the members of the community or any class of them into an accrued or vested right to which the presumption applies , the particular beneficiary of the right must have done something to avail himself of it before the law is changed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1410	The courts have grappled with this idea in a series of cases which Simon Brown LJ surveyed in Chief Adjudication Officer v Maguire -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 1 WLR 1778 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1411	It is not easy to reconcile all the decisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1412	This lends weight to the criticism that the reasoning in them is essentially circular : the courts have tended to attach the somewhat woolly label `` vested '' to those rights which they conclude should be protected from the effect of the new legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1413	If that is indeed so , then it is perhaps only to be expected since , as Lord Mustill observed in L'Office Cherifien des Phosphates v Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 486 , 525A , the basis of any presumption in this area of the law `` is no more than simple fairness , which ought to be the basis of every general rule .

149	1416	In Hedderwick v The Federal Commissioner of Land Tax -LRB- 1913 -RRB- 16 CLR 27 , 37 Griffith CJ said : `` It is hardly necessary to remark that the Crown 's vested rights are to be respected as much as are the rights of private persons . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1417	There is no suggestion in the present case that the application of the 1998 Act would affect any vested rights of the Crown or of any other public authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1418	It is not therefore necessary to decide whether the observation of the Chief Justice is sound as a general proposition or whether , if it is , the presumption would prevail in the case of the 1998 Act , given its objectives . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1419	Presumption that legislation does not affect pending proceedings 198 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1420	The authorities refer to a further presumption , that legislation does not apply to actions which are pending at the time when it comes into force unless the language of the legislation compels the conclusion that Parliament intended that it should . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1421	A well-known statement of this rule of construction is to be found in the judgment of Sir George Jessel MR in In re Joseph Suche & Co Ltd -LRB- 1875 -RRB- 1 Ch D 48 , 50 where he referred to : `` a general rule that when the legislature alters the rights of parties by taking away or conferring any right of action , its enactments , unless in express terms they apply to pending actions , do not affect them . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1422	In Zainal bin Hashim v Government of Malaysia -LSB- 1980 -RSB- AC 734 , 742C the Board deliberately modified this rule and slightly reduced its force : `` for pending actions to be affected by retrospective legislation , the language of the enactment must be such that no other conclusion is possible than that that was the intention of the legislature . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1423	The rule applies , of course , to all legislation , not just to legislation with retroactive effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1424	Indeed this particular presumption is a more limited version of the general presumption that legislation is not intended to affect vested rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1425	Since the potential injustice of interfering with the rights of parties to actual proceedings is particularly obvious , this narrower presumption will be that much harder to displace . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1426	In Zainal bin Hashim v Government of Malaysia , however , the Privy Council held that the language of the provision in question compelled the conclusion that it was intended to apply even to pending proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

149	1428	So far I have been dealing with changes in substantive law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1429	As can be seen from the statement of Wright J in In re Athlumney -LSB- 1898 -RSB- 2 QB 547 , 552 which I quoted above , changes in matters of pure procedure have been treated differently . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1430	Wilde B stated the position most starkly in Wright v Hale -LRB- 1860 -RRB- 6 H & N 227 , 232 : `` where the enactment deals with procedure only , unless the contrary is expressed , the enactment applies to all actions , whether commenced before or after the passing of the Act . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1431	The justification for treating matters of pure procedure differently was stated by Mellish LJ in Republic of Costa Rica v Erlanger -LRB- 1876 -RRB- 3 Ch D 62 , 69 : `` No suitor has any vested interest in the course of procedure , nor any right to complain , if during the litigation the procedure is changed , provided , of course , that no injustice is done .

149	1432	200 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1433	Although , at a general level , the distinction between matters of substance and matters of pure procedure is readily understandable , in practice it has not always proved easy to apply , especially in relation to legislation on limitation or prescription . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1434	For that reason , in Yew Bon Tew v Kenderaan Bas Mara -LSB- 1983 -RSB- AC 553 , 558H - 559A Lord Brightman cautioned against the potential dangers lurking in the description of a measure as `` procedural '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1435	In L'Office Cherifien v Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co Ltd -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 486 , 527G - 528C Lord Mustill went further and suggested that a single criterion of fairness should be applied to all provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1436	He added , at pp 525F - H : `` Precisely how the single question of fairness will be answered in respect of a particular statute will depend on the interaction of several factors , each of them capable of varying from case to case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1437	Thus , the degree to which the statute has retrospective effect is not a constant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1438	Nor is the value of the rights which the statute affects , or the extent to which that value is diminished or extinguished by the retrospective effect of the statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1439	Again , the unfairness of adversely affecting the rights , and hence the degree of unlikelihood that this is what Parliament intended , will vary from case to case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1440	So also will the clarity of the language used by Parliament , and the light shed on it by consideration of the circumstances in which the legislation was enacted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1441	All these factors must be weighed together to provide a direct answer to the question whether the consequences of reading the statute with the suggested degree of retrospectivity are so unfair that the words used by parliament can not have been intended to mean what they might appear to say . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1442	This is an application of the `` true principle '' identified by Staughton LJ in Secretary of State for Social Security v Tunnicliffe -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 2 All ER 712 , 724f - g : `` that Parliament is presumed not to have intended to alter the law applicable to past events and transactions in a manner which is unfair to those concerned in them , unless a contrary intention appears . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1443	It is not simply a question of classifying an enactment as retrospective or not retrospective . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

149	1445	201 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1446	On Lord Mustill 's approach an appropriate test might be formulated along these lines : Would the consequences of applying the statutory provision retroactively , or so as to affect vested rights or pending proceedings , be `` so unfair '' that Parliament could not have intended it to be applied in these ways ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

149	1456	The second is whether section 3 applies generally or only in such a way as not to affect rights that were vested , or proceedings that were pending , on 2 October 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1457	Those issues relating to section 3 can not be resolved in isolation , however , but only by looking at the 1998 Act as a whole . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1458	204 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1459	A single statute may contain some provisions which are retroactive and some which affect existing rights only for the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1460	Similarly , some provisions may apply generally on commencement and others only without prejudice to vested rights or without affecting pending proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1461	But , having regard to the purpose and structure of the 1998 Act , and subject to any express provisions to the contrary , Parliament must have intended all the operative provisions of this particular statute to take effect in the same way in respect of any given Convention right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1462	205 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1463	Section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- defines the expression `` the Convention rights '' as the rights and fundamental freedoms set out in certain specific articles of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1464	The Act then goes on to provide the two mechanisms by which they are to have effect in the domestic law of the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1465	First , under the appropriate cross-heading , in sections 3 to 5 - later complemented by section 10 - the Act provides a mechanism for giving effect to Convention rights in relation to legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1466	Secondly , again under an appropriate cross-heading , in sections 6 to 9 it contains a mechanism for giving effect to Convention rights in relation to the acts of public authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1467	206 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1468	These are the operative sections of the Act for present purposes and they all came into force on 2 October 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1469	Subject to the specific régime in section 22 -LRB- 4 -RRB- , there is nothing to suggest that Parliament intended that there should be any difference in the way that they were to be applied on commencement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1470	And , indeed , it would be surprising if there had been a difference , precisely because the two groups of sections constitute different , but complementary , mechanisms for giving effect to the same underlying Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1471	It is a matter of chance whether the relevant act of a public authority occurs in an area covered by the common law or by statute , or by a mixture of both . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1472	In that sense , it is equally a matter of chance whether sections 6 and 7 only , or sections 3 to 5 also , are in play . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1473	For instance , a party enjoying a right to equality of arms under article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- can rely on that right , if appropriate , to challenge the way court proceedings are conducted : section 7 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1474	If the relevant aspect of the proceedings is regulated , in whole or in part , by a statutory provision , he must be equally able to deal with it by invoking the court 's obligation under section 3 to read and give effect to the statutory provision compatibly with article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1475	If appropriate , section 4 also comes into play . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1476	So far as any given Convention right is concerned , it would make no sense for some of these sections to apply retroactively or to apply generally to the situation on commencement and for others not to apply in these ways . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1477	They must all apply in the same way or else the 1998 Act would not work smoothly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1478	207 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1479	The Court of Appeal rightly saw that the various operative provisions of the 1998 Act are interlinked and based part of their argument for applying sections 3 and 4 on section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- which makes it unlawful for a public authority , including a court , to act incompatibly with Convention rights : -LSB- 2002 -RSB- QB 74 , 86 , paras 10 - 12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1480	Since the issue was not raised before the Court of Appeal , that passage in their judgment naturally proceeds on the assumption that section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- itself applies in all cases from the date of commencement of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1481	That is not , however , something that can simply be assumed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1482	208 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1483	The issue which the House has to decide transcends sections 3 and 4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1484	It relates to the intention of Parliament when incorporating the Convention rights and enacting the operative provisions to give effect to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1485	Were those rights and provisions to apply retroactively ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1486	Or generally from the date of commencement ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1487	Or only so as not to affect vested rights or pending proceedings ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1488	In terms of the test as formulated in L'Office Cherifien des Phosphates v Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 486 , 525H , the answer is to be found by considering whether the consequences of applying the operative provisions retroactively or so as to affect vested rights or pending proceedings would be `` so unfair '' that Parliament could not have intended them to be applied in these ways . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1489	In fact , the question does not admit of a single answer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1490	Application of the 1998 Act in relation to different articles of the Convention 209 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1491	The operative provisions of the 1998 Act must all apply in the same way when used to give effect to the same Convention right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1492	But they may apply differently when used to give effect to different Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1493	Article 6 embodies rights in relation to matters of procedure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1494	When the 1998 Act is used to give effect to those article 6 rights in our domestic law , it provides remedies for defects in procedure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1495	There is no presumption against purely procedural statutory provisions applying generally on commencement since no-one has a vested right to any particular form of procedure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1496	It follows that , given its unqualified language , the 1998 Act applies generally from the date of commencement in so far as it gives effect to article 6 rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1497	That is only what one would expect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1498	Suppose , for instance , that during the hearing of the appeal in this case the Court of Appeal had done something - such as refusing to listen to submissions on behalf of First County - which was incompatible with their rights under article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1499	There can be no doubt that section 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- would have applied and that the Court of Appeal would have acted unlawfully in terms of it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1500	Similarly , section 7 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- would have applied and under it First County could have relied on their article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1501	Sections 3 to 5 would also have applied to the appeal for this purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
149	1502	So , if the alleged infringement of First County 's article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- rights had arisen out of a statutory provision regulating the procedure in the appeal , section 3 would have bound the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1503	Depending on how the statutory provision could be read under section 3 , the Court of Appeal could also have used the mechanism in sections 4 and 5 to make a declaration of the incompatibility of the provision with article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1504	210 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1505	In so far as articles of the Convention contain substantive rather than procedural rights , the presumption would be that Parliament did not intend that , when used to give effect to them , the operative provisions should interfere with vested rights or pending actions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1506	It is , however , unnecessary , and would be unwise , to go through the various articles with a view to identifying those Convention rights in respect of which Parliament would or would not have intended the 1998 Act to apply generally on commencement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1507	For example , I reserve my opinion on whether , because of the overwhelming importance and the absolute nature of articles 2 , 3 and 4 , Parliament would have intended that on commencement the Act would apply generally for the purpose of giving effect to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1508	The 1998 Act , including section 3 , not retroactive 211 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1509	It is convenient first to consider whether the 1998 Act , including section 3 , is retroactive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1510	212 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1511	Subject to one exception , there is nothing in the language of any of the sections in the Act to suggest that they are meant to be retroactive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1512	The exception is section 22 -LRB- 4 -RRB- which , expressly , gives retroactive effect to section -LRB- 7 -RRB- -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- in one particular situation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1513	The proper inference is that none of the other provisions is intended to apply retroactively . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1514	This inference is corroborated by the obvious , and potentially far-reaching , unfairness of unsettling the law relating to past events and transactions in different areas of the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1515	In these circumstances , applying the powerful presumption against retroactivity , I readily conclude that , subject to section 22 -LRB- 4 -RRB- , none of the operative provisions of the Act , including section 3 , is retroactive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1516	213 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1517	In the particular context of criminal proceedings this conclusion is fortified by the observations of Lord Clyde on section 3 in R v Lambert -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 AC 545 , 604 , at para 142 : `` The usual understanding of the appeal process is that the correctness of the decision appealed against should be determined in accordance with the law as it stood when the case was decided by the lower court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1518	But on the appellant 's approach it would seem that any case either of a civil or a criminal nature , decided according to the law as construed in the ordinary way prior to 2 October 2000 , if an appeal was brought so as to be heard on or after 2 October 2000 , would require to be decided by the application of a rule of construction , namely section 3 of the 1998 Act , which was not obligatory on the lower court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1519	But that involves giving an undue extension to the effect of section 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1520	In my view section 3 only became obligatory on courts on 2 October 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1521	The rule of construction which it expresses applies to all legislation whenever enacted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1522	But there is nothing to show that it was intended by section 3 that the meaning given to a statutory provision by a court prior to 2 October 2000 should be changed in the event of an appeal against that decision being heard on or after that date . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1523	The same thinking is to be found in the comment of Lord Hope of Craighead in R v Kansal -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 AC 69 , 112 , at para 83 `` the interpretative obligation in section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- can not be applied so as to change retrospectively the meaning which was previously given to a provision in primary legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1524	It does not make unlawful acts of courts or tribunals or other public authorities , which , as a result of provisions in primary legislation , could not at the time when the acts were done have been done differently : see section 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1525	In a very different civil context Lord Wright MR had said much the same in In re a Debtor -LSB- 1936 -RSB- Ch 237 , 243 : `` Thus while an appellate court is able , and bound , to give effect to new remedies which have been introduced by enactments passed after the order appealed from was made by the court of first instance , yet with regard to substantive rights it is well established that the appellate court must give effect to the same law as that which was in force at the date of the earlier proceeding ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1526	A matter of substantive right which has become res judicata can not be upset by a subsequent general change of the law , in the absence of precise intention to make the change so retrospective being evidenced in the Act . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1527	214 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1528	Although counsel referred to the passages from R v Lambert and R v Kansal -LRB- No 2 -RRB- during argument , in the present case that particular kind of problem does not arise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1529	Because of his decision on the prior point of interpretation , the county court judge did not consider or apply section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1530	The first court to consider and apply it was the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1531	Accordingly , the danger of an appeal court using section 3 to make a retroactive change in the law applied by a lower court , which was identified in R v Lambert and R v Kansal -LRB- No 2 -RRB- , simply did not present itself in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1532	None the less , the remarks of the Master of the Rolls in In re a Debtor suggest that this is merely one aspect of a wider question about the application of new statutory provisions to pending proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1533	The application of the operative provisions of the 1998 Act when used to give effect to article 1 215 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1534	For the reasons given by Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead , article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- is not engaged in this case . 	lord rodger	lord nicholls	NAN	1	NAN
149	1535	The only live question relates to the application of the operative provisions when used to give effect to the right in article 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1536	It is crucially important to bear in mind that this is not a question about the application of section 127 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the 1974 Act , as potentially modified by section 3 of the 1998 Act , so as to affect vested rights or pending actions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1537	Rather , it is a general question about the application of the operative provisions of the 1998 Act , when used to give effect to the article 1 right , so as to affect vested rights or pending proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1538	That question admits of only a single answer in regard to vested rights and pending proceedings respectively . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1539	And that answer can not be found by examining the circumstances of particular cases and then applying a more or less flexible test in the light of those circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1540	This is just an aspect of the point emphasised by Lord Mustill in L'Office Cherifien v Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co Ltd -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 486 , 528C , when he said that a court which sets out to apply the test of fairness is concerned `` not with the merits of the particular case but with the generality of rights which Parliament must have contemplated would suffer if the section took effect retrospectively . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1541	Furthermore , in the words of Isaacs J in George Hudson Ltd v Australian Timber Workers ' Union -LRB- 1923 -RRB- 32 CLR 413 , 434 , the whole circumstances must be considered : `` that is to say , the whole of the circumstances which the legislature may be assumed to have had before it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1542	What may seem unjust when regarded from the standpoint of one person affected may be absolutely just when a broad view is taken of all who are affected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1543	There is no remedial Act which does not affect some vested right , but , when contemplated in its total effect , justice may be overwhelmingly on the other side . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1544	So in this case the single answer to the broadly conceived question is to be found by considering how Parliament intended the operative provisions of the 1998 Act to apply in relation to the generality of vested rights or pending proceedings - not in relation to vested rights or pending proceedings under the 1974 Act , far less in relation to the individual plight of Mrs Wilson and First County . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1545	To descend to those levels of particularity would not only result in a myriad of single decisions but would be to attribute to Parliament the implausible intention that the meticulously drawn 1998 Act , embodying a landmark reform , was to apply in a piecemeal and haphazard fashion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1546	216 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1547	Indeed , it is only by taking that broad general view of the application of the 1998 Act that a puzzle at the heart of this case can be solved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1548	Depending on the particular legislative provision to be read through its prism , section 3 either results in the provision being modified and vested rights being affected , or else it leaves the provision unmodified and any vested rights intact . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1549	So , if the application of section 3 depended on the terms of the individual statutory provision to be read and given effect , it would be impossible to tell whether vested rights were affected , and so whether section 3 applied , without first applying it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1550	That vicious circle is avoided if section 3 is regarded as part of a package of operative provisions whose application falls to be determined by judging the consequences of applying the provisions so as to affect the generality of vested rights and pending proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1551	217 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1552	In considering how the package of provisions in the 1998 Act is to be applied , it would be pointless to scour them in the hope of finding clues in the minutiae of the language . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1553	Section 3 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- , which says that the section applies to primary and subordinate legislation whenever enacted , is one of the two express indications which the Act contains as to its application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1554	The other is in subsection -LRB- 4 -RRB- of section 22 , the minimalist application section , which makes section 7 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- apply retroactively in certain defined circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1555	It is unnecessary to decide in this case whether section 22 -LRB- 4 -RRB- applies to pending proceedings or so as to affect vested rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1556	For the rest , there is nothing in the operative provisions of the Act to show whether , in the case of substantive Convention rights , they are to apply generally or only so as not to affect vested rights or pending proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1557	In that sense , they are ambiguous and so the presumption against them applying to pending proceedings , in particular , comes into play . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1558	But it is necessary to consider whether that presumption is displaced by other relevant considerations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1559	The application of the operative provisions of the 1998 Act in the present case 218 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1560	In deciding how the operative sections of the 1998 Act should be applied when used to give effect to the substantive right in article 1 , I would attach significance to the importance , in general terms , of the rights which the 1998 Act incorporates into our domestic law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1561	It could be argued that , because of their importance , Parliament would have intended all of them to take immediate effect for all purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1562	Since article 6 rights , for instance , would clearly take immediate effect for all purposes , in the interests of uniformity the other rights - including the right under article 1 - should do so too . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1563	That argument could be reinforced by noticing the peculiar potency of the Convention rights by comparison with other rights under domestic law , which could therefore be expected to give way to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1564	Moreover , it might be said that , since a court applying article 1 must always balance competing interests , there would be no risk of the rights of parties to pending proceedings being crushed willy-nilly by the new Convention right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1565	Parliament could therefore have been satisfied that , when giving effect to the article 1 right , the Act could apply generally on commencement without there being any unacceptable risk of injustice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1566	Finally , and less importantly , it could be argued that the long interval between Royal Assent and commencement was an indication that , once the delay was over , the 1998 Act when used to give effect to article 1 was to have general effect : Craies on Statute Law ,7 th ed -LRB- 1971 -RRB- , pp 393 - 395 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1567	219 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1568	The last line of argument has rarely been accepted and I would not accept it in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1569	The other arguments carry more weight , but against them it can be said that the very importance and potency of the article 1 right make it all the less likely that Parliament would have intended that it should suddenly descend as a deus ex machina into pending proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1570	Moreover , not only is the unfairness of interfering with the rights of parties to pending proceedings very considerable but it is distinct and different in kind from the unfairness which may have to be balanced as one of the competing interests whenever article 1 is given effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1571	For these reasons I would conclude that there is no sufficient reason to hold that the presumption is displaced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1572	Applying the relevant rule of construction , since the language of the operative provisions admits another conclusion , they must be taken not to affect pending proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1573	To put the matter another way , in the case of article 1 , the consequences of applying the operative provisions of the 1998 Act to pending proceedings would be so unfair that Parliament could not have intended it to apply to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1574	220 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1575	The present action was in progress when the 1998 Act came into force on 2 October 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1576	So , for the purposes of article 1 , the operative provisions of the 1998 Act , including sections 3 to 5 , do not apply to this action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1577	I am content to rest my decision on that narrow ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1578	It follows that the Court of Appeal had no power to make the declaration of incompatibility that they did - and , indeed , that the Secretary of State had no right to be joined as a party under section 5 -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
149	1579	Despite this technical quirk , I would allow her appeal and make the order proposed by Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead . 	lord rodger	self	outcome	1	NAN
