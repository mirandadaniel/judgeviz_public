10	2	LORD NICHOLLS OF BIRKENHEAD 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
10	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
10	4	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
10	5	This appeal concerns an adoption order , sought by one natural parent -LRB- the father -RRB- with the consent of the other -LRB- the mother -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
10	6	The child is a girl , now three years old . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
10	7	Bracewell J made the adoption order : see -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 2 FLR 717 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
10	8	The Court of Appeal , comprising Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss P and Potter and Hale LJJ , reversed her decision : see -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 1 FLR 589 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
10	9	The father has appealed to your Lordships ' House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
10	10	At no stage has the mother taken any part in the proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
10	11	The story 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
10	12	From August 1997 the mother and the father , neither of whom is married , had a sexual relationship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
10	13	This ended in April 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls
10	14	Early in 1998 the mother became pregnant , although she did not realise this until some months later . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	15	The child -LRB- ` A ' -RRB- was born on 19 October 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	16	The mother was then aged 28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	17	Without looking at her baby the mother told the hospital staff that she wanted to have the child adopted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	18	This was the mother 's second child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	19	Her first child , also a daughter , was born in 1993 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	20	On that occasion , and in accordance with the mother 's wishes , the child had been adopted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	21	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	22	So A , when four days old , was placed with foster parents with a view to adoption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	23	Since the birth the mother has never met A nor , save at a distance , seen her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	24	The father , then aged 25 , was not aware of the mother 's pregnancy or of A 's birth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	25	Purely by chance the local social services authority learned of the father 's whereabouts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	26	They contacted him , and he quickly expressed his desire to look after A . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	27	The mother then co-operated with the father in making arrangements for A 's care . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	28	On 27 November 1998 they registered A 's birth together , with the father 's surname . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	29	On 7 December 1998 they entered into a parental responsibility agreement , whereby the father was to have parental responsibility as well as the mother . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	30	On 19 December 1998 A was placed with her father , and he has looked after her ever since . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	31	He gave up paid employment in order to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	32	Child A is thriving . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	33	The issue in the case is not whether the father should continue to care for A as a single natural parent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	34	That is not in doubt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	35	The issue is whether he should become her sole adoptive parent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	36	The adoption proceedings 4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	37	The father made his adoption application to his local Family Proceedings Court on 26 April 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	38	His understanding was that the mother was willing to agree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	39	Subsequently her views wavered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	40	The proceedings were transferred to the High Court because of their unusual nature . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls
10	41	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	42	The father is seeking an adoption order primarily because he is anxious to secure A 's future in his sole care . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	43	He feels insecure , and believes he will feel more secure knowing that the mother 's parental responsibility for A has been removed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	44	This can only be achieved by an adoption order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	45	The mother has said repeatedly she does not wish to play any part in A 's life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	46	But the father is concerned that , without an adoption order , it will remain possible in future years for the mother to pose a threat to A 's continued placement with him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	47	He is concerned that the mother may marry and , with her new husband , ask to have A to live with her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	48	The court might look favourably upon such an application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	49	His vulnerability to an attempt by the mother to reclaim A is something which has caused him great anxiety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	50	He is adamant in his wish for an adoption order , although whatever order is made will not affect the strength of his commitment to A . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	51	He does not , in principle , exclude the possibility of future contact by the mother with A , provided the placement with him is secure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	52	He is willing to adhere to his arrangement with the mother to provide an annual progress report and photograph . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	53	The mother has a similar arrangement with the adoptive parents of her elder daughter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	54	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	55	In his report to the court the Official Solicitor , acting as A 's guardian , opposed the application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	56	The sole consequence of an adoption order would be to end the mother 's relationship with A . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	57	This was not an order which could be said to safeguard and promote A 's welfare . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	58	There was nothing in the history of the case to suggest that the mother would be likely to seek to disrupt the security of A 's placement with her father . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	59	But any attempt by her to do so would not necessarily be to A 's disadvantage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	60	Further , the court has to be satisfied , before making an adoption order , that there is some reason justifying the exclusion of the mother , as required by section 15 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Adoption Act 1976 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	61	There was no sufficient reason in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	62	A 's placement with her father should be secured by a residence order , suitable prohibited steps orders , and an order requiring the mother to obtain permission from the court before making any application for an order under section 8 of the Children Act 1989 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	63	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	64	After this report had been prepared the Official Solicitor was able to meet the mother . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	65	Her response to the Official Solicitor 's report was that , although she considered the application was premature , she could understand the father 's reasons and was not going to stand in his way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	66	She made clear she would never seek to interfere with the lives of A and her father . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	67	She was not seeking direct contact with A . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls
10	68	While she could not say this would always be her position , as a first step she would obtain legal advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	69	She would not simply turn up on the father 's doorstep . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	70	She wished to maintain indirect contact with a yearly photograph and progress report . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	71	She then signed , in the presence of the Official Solicitor , the prescribed form of consent to the making of an adoption order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	72	That was on 20 June 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	73	The decision of the Judge 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	74	The application proceeded before Bracewell J on 29 June 2000 on the basis of affidavit evidence and reports . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	75	There was no oral evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	76	The judge concluded that the welfare of A ` demands ' there should be an adoption order ` in order to promote her welfare throughout her childhood ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	77	To comply with the requirements of section 15 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Adoption Act 1976 the circumstances must be exceptional . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	78	That was so here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	79	The reasons for the exclusion of the mother were that she had rejected A from birth and played no part in her care or upbringing , and she had consented to the adoption and wished to play no part in A 's life in the future , other than to have indirect contact . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	80	The judge said : ` This is not a case in which the mother has hesitated and weighed in the balance what she can provide for the child and what the father can provide . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	81	She has no interest in having any direct contact with A or participating in her upbringing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	82	She is an intelligent , reflective woman , who has been able to consider the position and has reached a reasoned position of not wanting to play a part in A 's life . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	83	The decision of the Court of Appeal 9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	84	With the leave of the judge , the Official Solicitor appealed from her decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	85	Hale LJ gave the leading judgment in the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	86	She considered that Bracewell J had misdirected herself on the requirements of section 15 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- of the Adoption Act 1976 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	87	Section 15 -LRB- 3 -RRB- , as amended by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 , section 49 -LRB- 5 -RRB- , Schedule 4 , paragraph 4 , provides : ` An adoption order shall not be made on the application of the mother or father of the child alone unless the court is satisfied that - -LRB- a -RRB- the other natural parent is dead or can not be found or , by virtue of section 28 of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 , there is no other parent , or -LRB- b -RRB- there is some other reason justifying the exclusion of the other natural parent , and where such an order is made the reason justifying the exclusion of the other natural parent shall be recorded by the court . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	88	Hale LJ noted that this provision is directed at sole adoption applications by natural parents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	89	She continued , at p 598 , para 34 : ` It requires of this already very small and unusual group that there be some reason , comparable to the death , disappearance or anonymous sperm donation of the other natural parent , ` justifying ' his or her exclusion , not only from parental responsibility for but also from the whole life and lineage of the child . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	90	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	91	Hale LJ found reinforcement for a restrictive interpretation of section 15 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- -LRB- ` some reason comparable to the death , disappearance or anonymous sperm donation of the other natural parent ' -RRB- in the need to read and give effect to this statutory provision , so far as possible , in a way which is compatible with the rights set out in article 8 of the European Convention for the protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	92	Article 8 provides : ' 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	93	Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life , his home and his correspondence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls
10	94	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	95	There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security , public safety or the economic well-being of the country , for the prevention of disorder or crime , for the protection of health or morals , or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	96	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	97	Hale LJ noted that an adoption order is an interference by a public authority , in the shape of the court which makes it , with the exercise of the right to respect for family life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	98	There are three components in the exceptions permitted under article 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- : the intervention must be ` in accordance with the law ' , in pursuit of one of the legitimate aims defined in article 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , and ` necessary in a democratic society ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	99	There is no difficulty with the first two components . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	100	The Adoption Act permits adoption in the circumstances of child A , but only if there is reason to exclude the mother . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	101	The intervention by the court is to protect the interests of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	102	As to the third component , the interference must meet a pressing social need and be proportionate to that need . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	103	Hale LJ said , at p 599 in paragraph 40 of her judgment : ' ... it is difficult indeed to argue that there is a pressing social need to deprive A of all legal relationship with one half of her family of birth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	104	... she already has a full and secure legal and factual relationship with her father . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	105	If there is any need to give her more , it can be provided for in a package of orders along the lines discussed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	106	In my view , it would be a disproportionate response to her current needs to turn her from the child of two legal parents , with two legal families , into the child of only one parent , with only one legal family . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	107	Section 15 -LRB- 3 -RRB- has to be given effect in such a way as to avoid that result . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	108	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	109	Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss P and Potter LJ agreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	110	The Court of Appeal set aside the adoption order , and substituted a residence order in favour of the father and an order prohibiting the mother from making any application under the Children Act 1989 relating to A without the leave of a High Court judge , any application for such leave to be made on notice to the Official Solicitor but without notice to the father unless the court directs otherwise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	111	The grounds on which the Court of Appeal intervened 13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	112	The essence of the reasoning of Hale LJ in paragraph 40 was that she formed a different view from the first instance judge on whether it was in the best interests of this little girl that the court should make an adoption order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	113	Using the structure of article 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Convention as a framework , she expressed the view that adoption was not in A 's best interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	114	Adoption by her father would be a ` disproportionate response ' to her current needs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	115	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	116	Unquestionably , on the facts in the present case this assessment of the course which is in the best interests of A was a possible view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	117	But before any question can arise of the Court of Appeal making its own assessment of the requirements of A 's welfare and substituting this for the judge 's assessment , it must be shown that the judge erred in some relevant respect : by misdirecting herself on the law or the evidence , or by being so plainly wrong that she must have misdirected herself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	118	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	119	This principle is so well established as scarcely to bear repetition : see , for instance , the observations of Lord Scarman in B v W -LRB- Wardship : Appeal -RRB- -LSB- 1979 -RSB- 1 WLR 1041 , 1055 , and Lord Fraser of Tullybelton in G v G -LRB- Minors : Custody Appeal -RRB- -LSB- 1985 -RSB- 1 WLR 647 , 650-653 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	120	On the instant appeal leading counsel appearing for A 's guardian submitted that , since this is not a case in which oral evidence was heard , it was more readily open to the Court of Appeal to substitute its view for that of the trial judge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls
10	121	He submitted that in so far as the Court of Appeal differed from the judge 's evaluation of the inferences to be drawn from the primary facts , the Court of Appeal was in as good a position as the judge and , therefore , it was entitled to form its own independent opinion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	122	In the light of this submission I must elaborate a little on this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	123	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	124	In cases such as the present the first instance judge decides which order , if any , he considers is in the best interests of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	125	When doing so the judge is often said to be exercising his ` discretion ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	126	In this context this expression is descriptive of the judicial evaluation and balancing of a number of factors from which an overall conclusion is reached on a concept whose application in any given case is inherently imprecise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	127	There is no objectively certain answer on which of two or more possible courses is in the best interests of a child In all save the most straightforward cases , there are competing factors , some pointing one way and some another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	128	There is no means of demonstrating that one answer is clearly right and another clearly wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	129	There are too many uncertainties involved in what , after all , is an attempt to peer into the future and assess the advantages and disadvantages which this or that course will or may have for the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	130	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	131	Hence the rationale underlying what I may call the principle in G v G. Courts of appeal exist to remedy mistakes in the first instance process . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	132	The Court of Appeal is not intended to be a forum in which unsuccessful litigants , where no error occurred at first instance , may have a second trial of the same issue by different judges under the guise of an appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	133	The mere fact that appellate judges might have reached a different conclusion had they been carrying out the evaluation and balancing exercise does not mean that the first instance judge fell into error . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	134	That fact does not , of itself , require or entitle the Court of Appeal to intervene . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	135	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	136	Frequently a judge at first instance will exercise his discretion as described above in proceedings where he will also have to evaluate witnesses and their oral testimony . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	137	Depending on the circumstances , this feature may be an additional reason why an appellate court should be slow to intervene . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	138	But the presence of this additional feature is not an essential ingredient of the circumstances in which the principle in G v G is applicable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	139	The principle in G v G applies irrespective of whether the evidence before the judge is oral or written , disputed or agreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	140	This principle is applicable in the present case even though the evidence before Bracewell J was wholly in written form . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	141	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	142	The matters discussed above are not peculiar to cases relating to children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	143	There are many types of case where the principle in G v G is applicable , with greater or less force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	144	In his valuable observations in In re Grayan Building Services Ltd -LRB- in liquidation -RRB- -LSB- 1995 -RSB- Ch 241 , 254-255 , my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann , then Hoffmann LJ , pointed out that the standards applied by the law in different contexts vary a great deal in precision : ` generally speaking , the vaguer the standard and the greater the number of factors which the court has to weigh up in deciding whether or not the standards have been met , the more reluctant an appellate court will be to interfere with the trial judge 's decision . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	145	Cases relating to the welfare of children tend to be towards the edge of the spectrum where an appellate court is particularly reluctant to interfere with the judge 's decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	146	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	147	It goes without saying that in the present case the highly experienced members of the Court of Appeal had these principles in mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls
10	148	Application of these principles is part of the staple diet of judges in that court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	149	Two strands of criticism of the judge 's judgment are discernible in the judgment of Hale LJ . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	150	The first , already mentioned , is that the judge materially misdirected herself on the proper interpretation and application of section 15 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Adoption Act 1976 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	151	If she did , the Court of Appeal was bound to carry out afresh the exercise of deciding whether , overall , it was in the best interests of A that an adoption order should be made in favour of her father . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	152	But if the judge did not err on this point , her decision must be allowed to stand unless , and this is the second criticism implicitly made by the Court of Appeal , her decision was plainly wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	153	Section 15 -LRB- 3 -RRB- : ` some other reason ' 21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	154	The Adoption Act 1976 requires the court , when deciding whether to make an adoption order , to have regard to all the circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	155	First consideration is to be given to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of the child throughout his childhood : section 6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	156	An adoption order in favour of one natural parent alone will have the effect of excluding the other parent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	157	In the present case an adoption order will mean that A is treated in law as if she were not the child of her mother : section 39 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	158	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	159	On its face this permanent exclusion of the child 's mother from the life of the child is a drastic and detrimental consequence of adoption so far as the child is concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	160	How serious this loss is likely to be depends on the circumstances of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	161	In deciding whether to make an order having this consequence the court must always be satisfied that this course is in the best interests of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	162	There must be some reason justifying the exclusion of the other natural parent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	163	The reason must be sufficient to outweigh the adverse consequences such an order may have by reason of the exclusion of one parent from the child 's life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	164	Consent of the excluded parent is not of itself a sufficient reason , but it is a factor to be taken into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	165	Its weight will depend on the circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	166	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	167	In so far as the Court of Appeal construed section 15 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- more restrictively than this , I am unable to agree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	168	Section 15 -LRB- 3 -RRB- imposes a prerequisite to the making of an adoption order on the application of the mother or father alone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	169	One or other of the exceptions set out in paragraphs -LRB- a -RRB- and -LRB- b -RRB- must be satisfied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	170	The three exceptions listed in paragraph -LRB- a -RRB- are instances where the other natural parent can not have , or is unlikely to have , any further part in the child 's upbringing and life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	171	But these three exceptions are not an exhaustive list of the circumstances in which a natural parent is unlikely in practice to have a further role in a child 's life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	172	Further , there may be other situations when the welfare of the child justifies the exclusion of a natural parent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	173	Abandonment , or persistent neglect or ill-treatment of the child , could be instances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	174	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls
10	175	It is not surprising , therefore , that the exception stated in paragraph -LRB- b -RRB- is altogether open-ended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	176	No doubt this was a deliberate choice of language . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	177	I can see no ground for importing into this exception an unexpressed limitation whereby ` some other reason ' must be comparable with the death or disappearance of the other natural parent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	178	What is required by paragraph -LRB- b -RRB- , and all that is required , is that the reason , whatever it be , must be sufficient to justify the exclusion of the other parent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	179	Whether any particular reason satisfies this test depends on the circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	180	This is a matter left to the decision of the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	181	On this question of interpretation I respectfully consider the Court of Appeal was unduly restrictive in its approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	182	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	183	An adoption order in favour of a single natural parent alone will also have the effect of permanently extinguishing any parental responsibility of the other natural parent : section 12 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Adoption Act 1976 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	184	This will afford the adoptive parent a measure of additional security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	185	But it is important here to keep in mind the wide range of powers the court now has under the Children Act 1989 to restrict the possibility of inappropriate intervention in the child 's life by the other natural parent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	186	Adoption is not intended to be used simply as the means by which to protect the child 's life with one natural parent against inappropriate intervention by the other natural parent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	187	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	188	Another consequence adoption has in this type of case is that after adoption the child will be treated in law as if she had been borne to her adoptive parent in wedlock : section 39 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- of the 1976 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	189	The significance of this benefit today should not be overstated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	190	The social and legal status of children born outside marriage has changed greatly in recent years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	191	The social stigma and legal disabilities attendant upon ` illegitimacy ' have now largely gone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	192	Two children in every five born in this country are born outside marriage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	193	Unless a contrary intention appears , statutes enacted after 1987 are to be interpreted without regard to whether a person 's parents were married at any time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	194	So also are wills and the existing statutory provisions relating to intestacy : see sections 1 , 18 and 19 of the Family Law Reform Act 1987 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	195	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	196	Having regard to all these matters , the circumstances in which it will be in the best interests of a child to make an adoption order in favour of one natural parent alone , thereby , in Hale LJ 's words , taking away one half of the child 's legal family , are likely to be exceptional . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	197	Bracewell J regarded the circumstances of the present case as exceptional . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	198	She said so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	199	The father 's case was that the mother 's continuing status as a parent with parental responsibility for A would perpetuate insecurity for him and that this would potentially affect A 's stability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	200	The judge accepted this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls
10	201	This is clear from the tenor of her extempore judgment , although she did not expressly so state . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	202	The chance circumstance which brought A 's father into A 's life and upbringing was bound to add to his anxieties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	203	Given the mother 's attitude to A from the moment of A 's birth , and her consent , adoption by the father was in A 's best interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	204	Adoption was in A 's best interests even though this would have the consequence of excluding the mother . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	205	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	206	In my view , on the evidence before her this conclusion was open to Bracewell J. I can see no indication that she misdirected herself on the proper interpretation or application of section 15 -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	207	Nor do I consider her decision can be said to be manifestly wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	208	That an adoption order as sought by A 's father will safeguard and promote A 's welfare is a wholly tenable view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	209	A residence order , together with an appropriate prohibited steps order , may not suffice to allay the father 's genuine anxieties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	210	In this type of case explicit analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of adoption must always be desirable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	211	But I do not think the absence of such an analysis from Bracewell J 's judgment vitiates , or casts doubt , on her conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	212	The reasoning implicit in her judgment is sufficiently apparent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	213	Article 8 : the right to respect for family life 29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	214	In reaching the contrary conclusion the Court of Appeal was influenced by its interpretation and application of article 8 of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	215	In considering this point it is important to keep in mind that in the present case the individual whose right has to be respected is the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	216	The mother has freely and unconditionally agreed to the making of an adoption order , with a full appreciation of the consequences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	217	So there is no question of adoption being a violation of her rights under article 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	218	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	219	As to child A 's rights , I agree with the Court of Appeal that the relationship of mother and child is of itself sufficient to establish ` family life ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	220	I agree also that section 15 -LRB- 3 -RRB- has to be given effect to in such a way as to avoid the result that a court might make an adoption order excluding one natural parent from the life of the child when this would represent an interference disproportionate to the child 's needs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	221	Where I part company with the Court of Appeal is that , unlike the Court of Appeal , I think this undesirable and unacceptable result is already precluded by the Adoption Act itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	222	There is no discordance between the statute and article 8 on this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	223	There is no need to ` read down ' section 15 -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- so as to avoid incompatibility which otherwise would exist . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	224	There is no need to have recourse to section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	225	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	226	My reason for holding this view is as follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	227	Take a case , such as the instant case , where the natural father alone seeks an adoption order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls
10	228	The court hears evidence and representations from all concerned , including the child 's guardian . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
10	229	The mother consents to the application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
10	230	The court considers the advantages and disadvantages adoption would have for the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
10	231	The court decides that an adoption order is best for the child in all the circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
10	232	I do not see how an adoption order made in this way can infringe the child 's rights under article 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
10	233	Under article 8 the adoption order must meet a pressing social need and be a proportionate response to that need : see , for example , Silver v United Kingdom -LRB- 1983 -RRB- 5 EHRR 347 , 376-377 , paragraph 97 -LRB- c -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
10	234	Inherent in both these Convention concepts is a balancing exercise , weighing the advantages and the disadvantages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
10	235	But this balancing exercise , required by article 8 , does not differ in substance from the like balancing exercise undertaken by a court when deciding whether , in the conventional phraseology of English law , adoption would be in the best interests of the child . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
10	236	The like considerations fall to be taken into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
10	237	Although the phraseology is different , the criteria to be applied in deciding whether an adoption order is justified under article 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- lead to the same result as the conventional tests applied by English law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
10	238	Thus , unless the court misdirected itself in some material respect when balancing the competing factors , its conclusion that an adoption order is in the best interests of the child , even though this would exclude the mother from the child 's life , identifies the pressing social need for adoption -LRB- the need to safeguard and promote the child 's welfare -RRB- and represents the court 's considered view on proportionality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
10	239	That is the effect of the judge 's decision in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
10	240	Article 8 -LRB- 2 -RRB- does not call for more . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
10	241	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls
