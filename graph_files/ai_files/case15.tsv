15	2	LORD BINGHAM OF CORNHILL 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
15	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
15	4	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
15	5	On 31 May 1995 the Home Secretary introduced a new policy -LRB- `` the policy '' -RRB- governing the searching of cells occupied by convicted and remand prisoners in closed prisons in England and Wales . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
15	6	The policy was expressed in the Security Manual as an instruction to prison governors in these terms : `` 17.69 Staff must accompany all searches of living accommodation in closed prisons with a strip search of the resident prisoner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
15	7	17.70 Staff must not allow any prisoner to be present during a search of living accommodation -LRB- although this does not apply to accommodation fabric checks -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
15	8	17.71 Staff must inform the prisoner as soon as practicable whenever objects or containers are removed from living accommodation for searching , and will be missing from the accommodation on the prisoner 's return . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
15	9	17.72 Subject to paragraph 17.73 , staff may normally read legal correspondence only if the Governor has reasonable cause to suspect that their contents endanger prison security , or the safety of others , or are otherwise of a criminal nature . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
15	10	In this case the prisoner involved shall be given the opportunity to be present and informed that their correspondence is to be read . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
15	11	17.73 But during a cell search staff must examine legal correspondence thoroughly in the absence of the prisoner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
15	12	Staff must examine the correspondence only so far as necessary to ensure that it is bona fide correspondence between the prisoner and a legal adviser and does not conceal anything else . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
15	13	17.74 When entering cells at other times -LRB- eg when undertaking accommodation fabric checks -RRB- staff must take care not to read legal correspondence belonging to prisoners unless the Governor has decided that the reasonable cause test in 17.72 applies . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord bingham
15	14	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	15	Mr Daly is a long term prisoner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	16	He challenges the lawfulness of the policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	17	He submits that section 47 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Prison Act 1952 , which empowers the Secretary of State to make rules for the regulation of prisons and for the discipline and control of prisoners , does not authorise the laying down and implementation of such a policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	18	But on this appeal to the House Mr Daly confines his challenge to a single aspect of the policy : the requirement that a prisoner may not be present when his legally privileged correspondence is examined by prison officers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	19	He contends that a blanket policy of requiring the absence of prisoners when their legally privileged correspondence is examined infringes , to an unnecessary and impermissible extent , a basic right recognised both at common law and under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms , and that the general terms of section 47 authorise no such infringement , either expressly or impliedly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	20	The origin of the policy 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	21	On 9 September 1994 six category A prisoners , classified as presenting an exceptional risk , escaped from the Special Security Unit at HMP Whitemoor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	22	An inquiry led by Sir John Woodcock , formerly HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary , was at once set up . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	23	The report of the inquiry , presented to Parliament in December 1994 -LRB- Cm 2741 -RRB- , revealed extensive mismanagement and malpractice at Whitemoor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	24	The escape had been possible only because prisoners had been able , undetected , to gather a mass of illicit property and equipment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	25	This in turn had been possible because prisoners ' cells and other areas had not been thoroughly searched at frequent but irregular intervals , partly because officers seeking to make such searches had been intimidated and obstructed by prisoners , partly because relations between officers and prisoners had in some instances become unacceptably familiar so that staff had been manipulated or `` conditioned '' into being less vigilant than they should have been in security matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	26	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	27	In its report the inquiry team made a number of recommendations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	28	One of these was that cells and property should be searched at frequent but irregular intervals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	29	Following a strip search , each prisoner was to be excluded from his cell during the search , to avoid intimidation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	30	The inquiry team gave no consideration at any stage to legal professional privilege or confidentiality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	31	The policy was introduced to give effect to the inquiry team 's recommendation on searching of cells . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	32	The legal background 5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	33	Any custodial order inevitably curtails the enjoyment , by the person confined , of rights enjoyed by other citizens . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	34	He can not move freely and choose his associates as they are entitled to do . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	35	It is indeed an important objective of such an order to curtail such rights , whether to punish him or to protect other members of the public or both . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	36	But the order does not wholly deprive the person confined of all rights enjoyed by other citizens . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	37	Some rights , perhaps in an attenuated or qualified form , survive the making of the order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	38	And it may well be that the importance of such surviving rights is enhanced by the loss or partial loss of other rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	39	Among the rights which , in part at least , survive are three important rights , closely related but free standing , each of them calling for appropriate legal protection : the right of access to a court ; the right of access to legal advice ; and the right to communicate confidentially with a legal adviser under the seal of legal professional privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	40	Such rights may be curtailed only by clear and express words , and then only to the extent reasonably necessary to meet the ends which justify the curtailment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	41	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord bingham
15	42	These propositions rest on a solid base of recent authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	43	In R v Board of Visitors of Hull Prison , Ex p St Germain -LSB- 1979 -RSB- QB 425 , 455 Shaw LJ made plain that `` despite the deprivation of his general liberty , a prisoner remains invested with residuary rights appertaining to the nature and conduct of his incarceration An essential characteristic of the right of a subject is that it carries with it a right of recourse to the courts unless some statute decrees otherwise . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	44	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	45	Raymond v Honey -LSB- 1983 -RSB- 1 AC 1 arose from the action of a prison governor who blocked a prisoner 's application to a court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	46	The House of Lords affirmed , at p 10 , that `` under English law , a convicted prisoner , in spite of his imprisonment , retains all civil rights which are not taken away expressly or by necessary implication '' Section 47 was held to be quite insufficient to authorise hindrance or interference with so basic a right as that of access to a court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	47	To the extent that rules were made fettering a prisoner 's right of access to the courts and in particular his right to institute proceedings in person they were ultra vires . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	48	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	49	In R v Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex p Anderson -LSB- 1984 -RSB- QB 778 the prisoner 's challenge was directed to a standing order which restricted visits by a legal adviser to a prisoner contemplating proceedings concerning his treatment in prison when he had not at the same time made any complaint to the prison authorities internally . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	50	Reiterating the principle that a prisoner remains invested with all civil rights which are not taken away expressly or by necessary implication , Robert Goff LJ , giving the judgment of the Queen 's Bench Divisional Court , said , at p 790 : `` At the forefront of those civil rights is the right of unimpeded access to the courts ; and the right of access to a solicitor to obtain advice and assistance with regard to the initiation of civil proceedings is inseparable from the right of access to the courts themselves . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	51	The standing order in question was held to be ultra vires . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	52	At pp 793-794 the court observed : `` As it seems to us , a requirement that an inmate should make a complaint as a prerequisite of his having access to his solicitor , however desirable it may be in the interests of good administration , goes beyond the regulation of the circumstances in which such access may take place , and does indeed constitute an impediment to his right of access to the civil court . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	53	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	54	Campbell v United Kingdom -LRB- 1992 -RRB- 15 EHRR 137 concerned the compatibility with the European Convention of rule 74 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the Prison -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Rules 1952 -LRB- SI 1952/565 -RRB- which provided that `` every letter to or from a prisoner shall be read by the Governor and it shall be within the discretion of the Governor to stop any letter if he considers that the contents are objectionable . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	55	This rule had earlier been upheld as valid by the Court of Session : Leech v Secretary of State for Scotland , 1991 SLT 910 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	56	The European Court held that the interference with the applicant 's correspondence violated article 8 of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	57	At p 161 , para 48 of its judgment , the court said : `` Admittedly , as the Government pointed out , the borderline between mail concerning contemplated litigation and that of a general nature is especially difficult to draw and correspondence with a lawyer may concern matters which have little or nothing to do with litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	58	Nevertheless , the Court sees no reason to distinguish between the different categories of correspondence with lawyers which , whatever their purpose , concern matters of a private and confidential character . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	59	In principle , such letters are privileged under Article 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	60	This means that the prison authorities may open a letter from a lawyer to a prisoner when they have reasonable cause to believe that it contains an illicit enclosure which the normal means of detection have failed to disclose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	61	The letter should , however , only be opened and should not be read . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	62	Suitable guarantees preventing the reading of the letter should be provided , eg opening the letter in the presence of the prisoner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	63	The reading of a prisoner 's mail to and from a lawyer , on the other hand , should only be permitted in exceptional circumstances when the authorities have reasonable cause to believe that the privilege is being abused in that the contents of the letter endanger prison security or the safety of others or are otherwise of a criminal nature . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	64	What may be regarded as ` reasonable cause ' will depend on all the circumstances but it presupposes the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the privileged channel of communication was being abused . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	65	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	66	That decision was applied in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex p Leech -LSB- 1994 -RSB- QB 198 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	67	This case concerned rule 33 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Prison Rules 1964 -LRB- SI 1964/388 -RRB- , which was in terms similar , although not identical , to rule 74 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the Scottish Rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	68	The decision is important for several reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	69	First , it re-stated the principles that every citizen has a right of unimpeded access to the court , that a prisoner 's unimpeded access to a solicitor for the purpose of receiving advice and assistance in connection with a possible institution of proceedings in the courts forms an inseparable part of the right of access to the courts themselves and that section 47 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1952 Act did not authorise the making of any rule which created an impediment to the free flow of communication between a solicitor and a client about contemplated legal proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord bingham
15	70	Legal professional privilege was described as an important auxiliary principle serving to buttress the cardinal principles of unimpeded access to the court and to legal advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	71	Secondly , it was accepted that section 47 -LRB- 1 -RRB- did not expressly authorise the making of a rule such as rule 33 -LRB- 3 -RRB- , and the court observed , at p 212 , that a fundamental right such as the common law right to legal professional privilege would very rarely be held to be abolished by necessary implication . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	72	But the court accepted that section 47 -LRB- 1 -RRB- should be interpreted as conferring power to make rules for the purpose of preventing escapes from prison , maintaining order in prisons , detecting and preventing offences against the criminal law and safeguarding national security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	73	Rules could properly be made to permit the examining and reading of correspondence passing between a prisoner and his solicitor in order to ascertain whether it was in truth bona fide correspondence and to permit the stopping of letters which failed such scrutiny . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	74	The crucial question was whether rule 33 -LRB- 3 -RRB- was drawn in terms wider than necessary to meet the legitimate objectives of such a rule . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	75	As it was put , at p 212 : `` The question is whether there is a self-evident and pressing need for an unrestricted power to read letters between a prisoner and a solicitor and a power to stop such letters on the ground of prolixity and objectionability . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	76	The court concluded that there was nothing which established objectively that there was a need in the interests of the proper regulation of prisons for a rule of the width of rule 33 -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	77	While section 47 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1952 Act by necessary implication authorised some screening of correspondence between a prisoner and a solicitor , such intrusion had to be the minimum necessary to ensure that the correspondence was in truth bona fide legal correspondence : since rule 33 -LRB- 3 -RRB- created a substantial impediment to exercise by the prisoner of his right to communicate in confidence with his solicitor the rule was drawn in terms which were needlessly wide , and so was held to be ultra vires . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	78	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	79	In the light of the decisions in Campbell and Leech , a new prison rule was made , now rule 39 of the Prison Rules 1999 -LRB- SI 1999/728 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	80	It provides , so far as material : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- A prisoner may correspond with his legal adviser and any court and such correspondence may only be opened , read or stopped by the governor in accordance with the provisions of this rule . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	81	-LRB- 2 -RRB- Correspondence to which this rule applies may be opened if the governor has reasonable cause to believe that it contains an illicit enclosure and any such enclosures shall be dealt with in accordance with the other provision of these Rules . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	82	-LRB- 3 -RRB- Correspondence to which this rule applies may be opened , read and stopped if the governor has reasonable cause to believe its contents endanger prison security or the safety of others or are otherwise of a criminal nature . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	83	-LRB- 4 -RRB- A prisoner shall be given the opportunity to be present when any correspondence to which this rule applies is opened and shall be informed if it or any enclosure is to be read or stopped . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	84	This rule , it is accepted , applies only to correspondence in transit from prisoner to solicitor or vice versa . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	85	The references to opening and stopping make plain that it has no application to legal correspondence or copy correspondence received or made by a prisoner and kept by him in his cell . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	86	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	87	The Court of Appeal decision in Leech was endorsed and approved by the House of Lords in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex p Simms -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 2 AC 115 , which arose from a prohibition on visits to serving prisoners by journalists seeking to investigate whether the prisoners had , as they claimed , been wrongly convicted , save on terms which precluded the journalists from making professional use of the material obtained during such visits . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	88	The House considered whether the Home Secretary 's evidence showed a pressing need for a measure which restricted prisoners ' attempts to gain access to justice , and found none . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	89	The more substantial the interference with fundamental rights , the more the court would require by way of justification before it could be satisfied that the interference was reasonable in a public law sense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	90	In this as in other cases there was applied the principle succinctly stated by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex p Pierson -LSB- 1998 -RSB- AC 539 , 575 : `` From these authorities I think the following proposition is established . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	91	A power conferred by Parliament in general terms is not to be taken to authorise the doing of acts by the donee of the power which adversely affect the legal rights of the citizen or the basic principles on which the law of the United Kingdom is based unless the statute conferring the power makes it clear that such was the intention of Parliament . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	92	The argument 13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	93	The ambit of the present argument is very narrow . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	94	In the face of a compelling statement by Mr Narey , the Director General of HM Prison Service , Mr Daly accepts the need for random searches of prisoners ' cells for the purpose of security , preventing crime and maintaining order and discipline . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	95	He accepts that such searches may properly be carried out in the absence of the resident prisoner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	96	He accepts the need for prison officers to examine legal correspondence held by prisoners in their cells to make sure that it is bona fide legal correspondence and that such correspondence is not used as a convenient hiding place to secrete drugs or illicit materials of any kind , or to keep escape plans or any records of illegal activity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	97	Thus he does not claim that privileged legal correspondence is immune from all examination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord bingham
15	98	He contends only that such examination should ordinarily take place in the presence of the prisoner whose correspondence it is . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	99	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	100	The Home Secretary for his part accepts that prison officers may not read a prisoner 's privileged legal correspondence during a cell search carried out in the absence of the prisoner . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	101	But he relies on the statement of Mr Narey , who regards the right to examine such correspondence as necessary and regards the absence of the prisoner during the examination as a necessary feature of the policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	102	Mr Narey states : `` The aim of the search procedure is to prevent the concealment of material likely to endanger prison security , or the safety of others or which would contribute to criminal activity within the prison . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	103	These searches must be carried out in the absence of the prisoner in order to discourage prisoners from using intimidatory or conditioning tactics to prevent officers carrying out a full search of possessions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	104	By ` conditioning tactics ' I mean action by which prisoners seek to influence the future behaviour of prison officers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	105	For example , a prisoner might create a scene whenever a particular item was searched , intending to cause prison officers not to search it in future on the ground that searching it was more trouble than it was worth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	106	The policy also prevents prisoners from becoming familiar with searching techniques generally and those of individual officers . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	107	Mr Narey goes on to state that alternative procedures have been considered within the prison service and rejected and states : `` The difficulty is that the prisoner 's presence would compromise the policy 's aims of preventing prisoners from intimidating or conditioning officers and from gaining familiarity with general and individual search techniques . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	108	He goes on to say : `` The respondent -LSB- Secretary of State -RSB- , the Prison Service and its staff , are mindful that the distinction between the examination of legal documents to confirm that they are bona fide and do not conceal anything illicit and the reading of legal documents -LRB- which current instructions expressly preclude other than by authority of a governor acting on received intelligence -RRB- , is a fine one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	109	However , anything of an illicit nature such as records of key codes or drug dealing can with ease be disguised as brief notations on what in every other respect is a legitimate legal document . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	110	It is the considered opinion of the respondent , of the Prison Service generally , and my own view , that the unreliability of current intelligence systems in prisons makes it unavoidable that we maintain the current position in an effort to deter concealments of this nature and the resultant threat to security and good order and discipline . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	111	A record of illicit property found during cell searches year by year since 1993 , appended to Mr Narey 's statement , shows that the number of finds per year has very greatly increased since 1995 , although the number of items which could be concealed in legal correspondence is relatively very small . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	112	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	113	It is necessary , first , to ask whether the policy infringes in a significant way Mr Daly 's common law right that the confidentiality of privileged legal correspondence be maintained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	114	He submits that it does for two related reasons : first , because knowledge that such correspondence may be looked at by prison officers in the absence of the prisoner inhibits the prisoner 's willingness to communicate with his legal adviser in terms of unreserved candour ; and secondly , because there must be a risk , if the prisoner is not present , that the officers will stray beyond their limited role in examining legal correspondence , particularly if , for instance , they see some name or reference familiar to them , as would be the case if the prisoner were bringing or contemplating bringing proceedings against officers in the prison . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	115	For the Home Secretary it is argued that the policy involves no infringement of a prisoner 's common law right since his privileged correspondence is not read in his absence but only examined . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	116	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	117	I have no doubt that the policy infringes Mr Daly 's common law right to legal professional privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	118	This was the view of two very experienced judges in R v Governor of Whitemoor Prison , Ex p Main -LSB- 1999 -RSB- QB 349 , against which decision the present appeal is effectively brought . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	119	At p 366 Kennedy LJ said : `` In my judgment legal professional privilege does attach to correspondence with legal advisers which is stored by a prisoner in his cell , and accordingly such correspondence is to be protected from any unnecessary interference by prison staff . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	120	Even if the correspondence is only inspected to see that it is what it purports to be that is likely to impair the free flow of communication between a convicted or remand prisoner on the one hand and his legal adviser on the other , and therefore it constitutes an impairment of the privilege . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	121	Judge LJ was of the same opinion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	122	At p 373 , he said : `` Prisoners whose cells are searched in their absence will find it difficult to believe that their correspondence has been searched but not read . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	123	The governor 's order will sometimes be disobeyed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	124	Accordingly I am prepared to accept the potential ` chilling effect ' of such searches . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	125	In an imperfect world there will necessarily be occasions when prison officers will do more than merely examine prisoners ' legal documents , and apprehension that they may do so is bound to inhibit a prisoner 's willingness to communicate freely with his legal adviser . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord bingham
15	126	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	127	The next question is whether there can be any ground for infringing in any way a prisoner 's right to maintain the confidentiality of his privileged legal correspondence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	128	Plainly there can . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	129	Some examination may well be necessary to establish that privileged legal correspondence is what it appears to be and is not a hiding place for illicit materials or information prejudicial to security or good order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	130	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	131	It is then necessary to ask whether , to the extent that it infringes a prisoner 's common law right to privilege , the policy can be justified as a necessary and proper response to the acknowledged need to maintain security , order and discipline in prisons and to prevent crime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	132	Mr Daly 's challenge at this point is directed to the blanket nature of the policy , applicable as it is to all prisoners of whatever category in all closed prisons in England and Wales , irrespective of a prisoner 's past or present conduct and of any operational emergency or urgent intelligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	133	The Home Secretary 's justification rests firmly on the points already mentioned : the risk of intimidation , the risk that staff may be conditioned by prisoners to relax security and the danger of disclosing searching methods . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	134	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	135	In considering these justifications , based as they are on the extensive experience of the prison service , it must be recognised that the prison population includes a core of dangerous , disruptive and manipulative prisoners , hostile to authority and ready to exploit for their own advantage any concession granted to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	136	Any search policy must accommodate this inescapable fact . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	137	I can not however accept that the reasons put forward justify the policy in its present blanket form . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	138	Any prisoner who attempts to intimidate or disrupt a search of his cell , or whose past conduct shows that he is likely to do so , may properly be excluded even while his privileged correspondence is examined so as to ensure the efficacy of the search , but no justification is shown for routinely excluding all prisoners , whether intimidatory or disruptive or not , while that part of the search is conducted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	139	Save in the extraordinary conditions prevailing at Whitemoor before September 1994 , it is hard to regard the conditioning of staff as a problem which could not be met by employing dedicated search teams . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	140	It is not suggested that prison officers when examining legal correspondence employ any sophisticated technique which would be revealed to the prisoner if he were present , although he might no doubt be encouraged to secrete illicit materials among his legal papers if the examination were obviously very cursory . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	141	The policy can not in my opinion be justified in its present blanket form . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	142	The infringement of prisoners ' rights to maintain the confidentiality of their privileged legal correspondence is greater than is shown to be necessary to serve the legitimate public objectives already identified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	143	I accept Mr Daly 's submission on this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	144	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	145	I am fortified in reaching this view by four considerations , all of some importance in my opinion : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Following a complaint to him about the policy by a prisoner other than Mr Daly in November 1995 , the Prisons Ombudsman carried out a full inquiry and reported in November 1996 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	146	In his report the Ombudsman said : `` I entirely support the main thrust of Woodcock 's recommendations regarding cell searching . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	147	It is apparent that prisoner intimidation was precluding the effective searching of prisoner accommodation in many establishments , and that this searching , which is essential for the safety and security of both staff and prisoners , is carried out far more effectively when the prisoner is absent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	148	This procedure has also been assisted by the introduction of the volumetric control of prisoners ' in-possession property . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	149	However , the legal privilege which must protect the confidentiality of correspondence between a solicitor and his client is too important to be sacrificed for the sake of expediency ; whilst it would undoubtedly be easier for staff to search a prisoner 's legal documents in his absence , this allows legal privilege to be compromised to an unacceptable degree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	150	`` It is clear that , in complaining about the Prison Service 's cell searching policy , -LSB- the prisoner -RSB- has raised a matter which has far-reaching consequences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	151	I believe that his complaint is a valid one and that , in searching prisoners ' legal papers in their absence , the Prison Service is compromising the legal privilege which ensures that correspondence between a solicitor and his client will remain confidential . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	152	I therefore uphold -LSB- the prisoner 's -RSB- complaint . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord bingham
15	153	Security Group has previously drafted a revised version of section 68.3 of the Security Manual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	154	This revised version allows the prisoner to remain in the cell while his legal documents are being searched , after which the documents are sealed in a box or bag , thus avoiding any possible compromise of legal privilege . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	155	I consider that the Security Manual should be amended to incorporate this revised method of cell searching . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	156	-LRB- 2 -RRB- The Ombudsman 's investigations revealed that , following a complaint by a prisoner confined in HMP Full Sutton , a procedure had been developed in that prison to meet the wishes of prisoners who objected to the searching of their legal documents in their absence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	157	The procedure was that `` if the prisoner objects to his legal documents being searched in his absence DST -LSB- dedicated search team -RSB- staff place the documents in a bag , seal the bag using a numbered reception seal and give the prisoner a copy of the seal number . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	158	The bag is left in the prisoner 's cell while the search is being carried out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	159	When the prisoner returns , he checks the seal on the bag to ensure that it has not been tampered with and the documents are searched in his presence . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	160	It does not appear that this procedure gave rise to difficulty in practice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	161	-LRB- 3 -RRB- The current standing order covering cell searches in Scotland provides that `` When a cell is searched , this should be done by at least two officers , in the prisoner 's presence . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	162	It is pointed out that the prison population in Scotland is small compared with that of England and Wales , there are very few high risk prisoners and escape is rare . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	163	No doubt the problem of control is less acute in Scotland than in England and Wales . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	164	But the Scottish experience does suggest that a policy which generally permits a prisoner to be present during the examination of his privileged legal correspondence , unless there are , or are reasonably believed to be , good reasons for excluding him , is not unworkable in practice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	165	-LRB- 4 -RRB- While cell searches in recent years have led to the finding of very many more items of illicit property than in earlier years , only two such items have been identified as having been found among legal documents and the great majority of items found could not have been concealed in that way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	166	It does not appear that legal files or bundles have been regarded by prisoners as a highly favoured hiding place for materials they are not permitted to hold . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	167	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	168	In Ex p Main -LSB- 1999 -RSB- QB 349 and again in the present case , the Court of Appeal held that the policy represented the minimum intrusion into the rights of prisoners consistent with the need to maintain security , order and discipline in prisons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	169	That is a conclusion which I respect but can not share . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	170	In my opinion the policy provides for a degree of intrusion into the privileged legal correspondence of prisoners which is greater than is justified by the objectives the policy is intended to serve , and so violates the common law rights of prisoners . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	171	Section 47 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1952 Act does not authorise such excessive intrusion , and the Home Secretary accordingly had no power to lay down or implement the policy in its present form . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	172	I would accordingly declare paragraphs 17.69 to 17.74 of the Security Manual to be unlawful and void in so far as they provide that prisoners must always be absent when privileged legal correspondence held by them in their cells is examined by prison officers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	173	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	174	Although , in response to a request by the House during argument , counsel for Mr Daly proffered a draft rule which might be adopted to govern the searching of privileged legal correspondence , it would be inappropriate for the House to attempt to formulate or approve the terms of such a rule , which would call for careful consideration and consultation before it was finalised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	175	It is enough to indicate that any rule should provide for a general right for prisoners to be present when privileged legal correspondence is examined , and in practice this will probably mean any legal documentation to avoid time-wasting debate about which documents are privileged and which are not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	176	But the rule must provide for the exclusion of the prisoner while the examination takes place if there is or is reasonably believed to be good cause for excluding him to safeguard the efficacy of the search , and the rule must permit the prison authorities to respond to sudden operational emergencies or urgent intelligence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	177	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	178	I have reached the conclusions so far expressed on an orthodox application of common law principles derived from the authorities and an orthodox domestic approach to judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	179	But the same result is achieved by reliance on the European Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	180	Article 8.1 gives Mr Daly a right to respect for his correspondence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord bingham
15	181	While interference with that right by a public authority may be permitted if in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security , public safety , the prevention of disorder or crime or for protection of the rights and freedoms of others , the policy interferes with Mr Daly 's exercise of his right under article 8.1 to an extent much greater than necessity requires . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
15	182	In this instance , therefore , the common law and the convention yield the same result . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
15	183	But this need not always be so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
15	184	In Smith and Grady v United Kingdom -LRB- 1999 -RRB- 29 EHRR 493 , the European Court held that the orthodox domestic approach of the English courts had not given the applicants an effective remedy for the breach of their rights under article 8 of the convention because the threshold of review had been set too high . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
15	185	Now , following the incorporation of the convention by the Human Rights Act 1998 and the bringing of that Act fully into force , domestic courts must themselves form a judgment whether a convention right has been breached -LRB- conducting such inquiry as is necessary to form that judgment -RRB- and , so far as permissible under the Act , grant an effective remedy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham

15	194	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
15	195	There was written and oral argument on the question whether certain observations of Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR in R -LRB- Mahmood -RRB- v Secretary of State for the Home Department -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 1 WLR 840 were correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
15	196	The context was an immigration case involving a decision of the Secretary of State made before the Human Rights Act 1998 came into effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
15	197	The Master of the Rolls nevertheless approached the case as if the Act had been in force when the Secretary of State reached his decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
15	198	He explained the new approach to be adopted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
15	199	The Master of the Rolls concluded , at p 857 , para 40 : `` When anxiously scrutinising an executive decision that interferes with human rights , the court will ask the question , applying an objective test , whether the decision-maker could reasonably have concluded that the interference was necessary to achieve one or more of the legitimate aims recognised by the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
15	200	When considering the test of necessity in the relevant context , the court must take into account the European jurisprudence in accordance with section 2 of the 1998 Act . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
15	201	These observations have been followed by the Court of Appeal in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex p Isiko -LRB- unreported -RRB- , 20 December 2000 and by Thomas J in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department , Ex p Samaroo -LRB- unreported -RRB- , 20 December 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
15	202	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
15	203	The explanation of the Master of the Rolls in the first sentence of the cited passage requires clarification . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
15	204	It is couched in language reminiscent of the traditional Wednesbury ground of review -LRB- Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation -LSB- 1948 -RSB- 1 KB 223 -RRB- , and in particular the adaptation of that test in terms of heightened scrutiny in cases involving fundamental rights as formulated in R v Ministry of Defence , Ex p Smith -LSB- 1996 -RSB- QB 517 , 554E-G per Sir Thomas Bingham MR. There is a material difference between the Wednesbury and Smith grounds of review and the approach of proportionality applicable in respect of review where convention rights are at stake . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
15	205	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
15	206	The contours of the principle of proportionality are familiar . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
15	207	In de Freitas v Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Agriculture , Fisheries , Lands and Housing -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 1 AC 69 the Privy Council adopted a three stage test . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
15	208	Lord Clyde observed , at p 80 , that in determining whether a limitation -LRB- by an act , rule or decision -RRB- is arbitrary or excessive the court should ask itself : `` whether : -LRB- i -RRB- the legislative objective is sufficiently important to justify limiting a fundamental right ; -LRB- ii -RRB- the measures designed to meet the legislative objective are rationally connected to it ; and -LRB- iii -RRB- the means used to impair the right or freedom are no more than is necessary to accomplish the objective . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord bingham
15	209	Clearly , these criteria are more precise and more sophisticated than the traditional grounds of review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
15	210	What is the difference for the disposal of concrete cases ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
15	211	Academic public lawyers have in remarkably similar terms elucidated the difference between the traditional grounds of review and the proportionality approach : see Professor Jeffrey Jowell QC , `` Beyond the Rule of Law : Towards Constitutional Judicial Review '' -LSB- 2000 -RSB- PL 671 ; Craig , Administrative Law , 4th ed -LRB- 1999 -RRB- , 561-563 ; Professor David Feldman , `` Proportionality and the Human Rights Act 1998 '' , essay in The Principle of Proportionality in the Laws of Europe -LRB- 1999 -RRB- , pp 117 , 127 et seq. . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
15	212	The starting point is that there is an overlap between the traditional grounds of review and the approach of proportionality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
15	213	Most cases would be decided in the same way whichever approach is adopted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
15	214	But the intensity of review is somewhat greater under the proportionality approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
15	215	Making due allowance for important structural differences between various convention rights , which I do not propose to discuss , a few generalisations are perhaps permissible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
15	216	I would mention three concrete differences without suggesting that my statement is exhaustive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
15	217	First , the doctrine of proportionality may require the reviewing court to assess the balance which the decision maker has struck , not merely whether it is within the range of rational or reasonable decisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
15	218	Secondly , the proportionality test may go further than the traditional grounds of review inasmuch as it may require attention to be directed to the relative weight accorded to interests and considerations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
15	219	Thirdly , even the heightened scrutiny test developed in R v Ministry of Defence , Ex p Smith -LSB- 1996 -RSB- QB 517 , 554 is not necessarily appropriate to the protection of human rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
15	220	It will be recalled that in Smith the Court of Appeal reluctantly felt compelled to reject a limitation on homosexuals in the army . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
15	221	The challenge based on article 8 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms -LRB- the right to respect for private and family life -RRB- foundered on the threshold required even by the anxious scrutiny test . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
15	222	The European Court of Human Rights came to the opposite conclusion : Smith and Grady v United Kingdom -LRB- 1999 -RRB- 29 EHRR 493 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
15	223	The court concluded , at p 543 , para 138 : `` the threshold at which the High Court and the Court of Appeal could find the Ministry of Defence policy irrational was placed so high that it effectively excluded any consideration by the domestic courts of the question of whether the interference with the applicants ' rights answered a pressing social need or was proportionate to the national security and public order aims pursued , principles which lie at the heart of the court 's analysis of complaints under article 8 of the Convention . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
15	224	In other words , the intensity of the review , in similar cases , is guaranteed by the twin requirements that the limitation of the right was necessary in a democratic society , in the sense of meeting a pressing social need , and the question whether the interference was really proportionate to the legitimate aim being pursued . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
15	225	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
15	226	The differences in approach between the traditional grounds of review and the proportionality approach may therefore sometimes yield different results . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
15	227	It is therefore important that cases involving convention rights must be analysed in the correct way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
15	228	This does not mean that there has been a shift to merits review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
15	229	On the contrary , as Professor Jowell -LSB- 2000 -RSB- PL 671 , 681 has pointed out the respective roles of judges and administrators are fundamentally distinct and will remain so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
15	230	To this extent the general tenor of the observations in Mahmood -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 1 WLR 840 are correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
15	231	And Laws LJ rightly emphasised in Mahmood , at p 847 , para 18 , `` that the intensity of review in a public law case will depend on the subject matter in hand '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham
15	232	That is so even in cases involving Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord bingham

15	239	I add some brief observations on two matters , less to supplement what they have said than to underline its importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
15	240	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
15	241	First , while this case has arisen in a jurisdiction where the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms applies , and while the case is one in which the Convention and the common law produce the same result , it is of great importance , in my opinion , that the common law by itself is being recognised as a sufficient source of the fundamental right to confidential communication with a legal adviser for the purpose of obtaining legal advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
15	242	Thus the decision may prove to be in point in common law jurisdictions not affected by the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
15	243	Rights similar to those in the Convention are of course to be found in constitutional documents and other formal affirmations of rights elsewhere . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
15	244	The truth is , I think , that some rights are inherent and fundamental to democratic civilised society . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
15	245	Conventions , constitutions , bills of rights and the like respond by recognising rather than creating them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
15	246	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
15	247	To essay any list of these fundamental , perhaps ultimately universal , rights is far beyond anything required for the purpose of deciding the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
15	248	It is enough to take the three identified by Lord Bingham : in his words , access to a court ; access to legal advice ; and the right to communicate confidentially with a legal adviser under the seal of legal professional privilege . 	lord cooke	lord bingham	partagr	0.9	lord bingham
15	249	As he says authoritatively from the woolsack , such rights may be curtailed only by clear and express words , and then only to the extent reasonably necessary to meet the ends which justify the curtailment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
15	250	The point that I am emphasising is that the common law goes so deep . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
15	251	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
15	252	The other matter concerns degrees of judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
15	253	Lord Steyn illuminates the distinctions between `` traditional '' -LRB- that is to say in terms of English case law , Wednesbury -RRB- standards of judicial review and higher standards under the European Convention or the common law of human rights . 	lord cooke	lord steyn	partagr	0.9	lord bingham
15	254	As he indicates , often the results are the same . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
15	255	But the view that the standards are substantially the same appears to have received its quietus in Smith and Grady v United Kingdom -LRB- 1999 -RRB- 29 EHRR 493 and Lustig-Prean and Beckett v United Kingdom -LRB- 1999 -RRB- 29 EHRR 548 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
15	256	And I think that the day will come when it will be more widely recognised that Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation -LSB- 1948 -RSB- 1 KB 223 was an unfortunately retrogressive decision in English administrative law , insofar as it suggested that there are degrees of unreasonableness and that only a very extreme degree can bring an administrative decision within the legitimate scope of judicial invalidation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
15	257	The depth of judicial review and the deference due to administrative discretion vary with the subject matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
15	258	It may well be , however , that the law can never be satisfied in any administrative field merely by a finding that the decision under review is not capricious or absurd . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
15	259	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord bingham
