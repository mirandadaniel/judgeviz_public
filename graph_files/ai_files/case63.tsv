63	5	The question in this appeal is whether a supplier of insurance and related services should be denied the exemption from VAT required by article 13B -LRB- a -RRB- of the EC Sixth Directive of 17 May 1977 on turnover taxes -LRB- 77/388/EEC -RRB- on the ground that it failed to comply with a formal requirement prescribed by United Kingdom law .

63	7	CR Smith Glaziers -LRB- Dunfermline -RRB- Ltd -LRB- `` the taxpayer '' -RRB- supplies double glazing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
63	8	It gives a 10 year guarantee supported by an insurance policy -LRB- arranged by a broker with an established insurance company -RRB- to protect the customer against the risk of its insolvency . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
63	9	The charge to the customer consists of the price of the double glazing and additional charges for the insurance premium and services provided in arranging and administering the policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
63	10	There is no dispute that the supply of these additional services is prima facie exempt from VAT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann

63	12	Section 38 of the Finance Act 1997 , which came into force on 19 March 1997 , prescribed new conditions for the exemption of UK suppliers of insurance and related services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
63	13	It substituted the following provisions in Group 2 of Schedule 9 to the Value Added Tax Act 1994 : `` Item No 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann

'' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	20	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	21	It is not disputed that the insurance-related services supplied by the taxpayer fell within Note -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	22	They were related to the supply of taxable double glazing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	23	It was accordingly necessary to satisfy the relevant requirements as specified in Note -LRB- 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	24	This means that a document containing the `` statements '' specified in Note -LRB- 5 -RRB- has been prepared and that the matters required to be stated have been `` disclosed to the customer '' at or before the time when the transaction was entered into . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	25	No relevant requirements as to the preparation and form of the document or manner of disclosure have been specified pursuant to the power in Note -LRB- 4 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	26	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	27	The question in this appeal is whether the Note -LRB- 4 -RRB- requirements were satisfied by the taxpayer during the period from the date when they came into force , 19 March 1997 until 31 December 1997 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	28	I must describe the taxpayer 's standard form of contract during the relevant period . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	29	On its face , it is headed by the word `` Contract '' in large letters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	30	Most of the front page consists of boxes giving various options as to the size , form , materials , finishes and so forth of the windows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	31	By reference to these boxes the salesman can look up the prices in his book and calculate the total due . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	32	At the bottom of the front page is a box for -LRB- among other things -RRB- the `` Total Contract Price -LRB- ex VAT -RRB- '' , the VAT and the `` Total Contract Price -LRB- inc VAT -RRB- '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	33	It must be assumed that these items were ordinarily filled in . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	34	Next to the box is a notice which says : `` Once signed this will be a legally binding document . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	35	Sign it only if you have read the whole of this page and the conditions printed overleaf and agree to be legally bound by them . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	36	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	37	The front page contains no reference to insurance or the premium or any charge for insurance-related services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	38	The back , however , contains a good deal of small print . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	39	There is a section headed `` Practical Matters - what is included and what is not/who does what '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	40	This is followed by seven clauses -LRB- divided into sub-clauses -RRB- under the heading `` Standard Conditions - sale/fitting of the products '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	41	Clause 3 is headed `` Price/Payment terms '' and clause 3.4 says : `` Where the total contract price is # 1000 or more the installation is insurance backed and the premium of # 16 is included in the total contract price . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	42	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	43	Clause 6 is headed `` Guarantee '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	44	Clause 6.3 says : `` In support of the guarantee CR Smith have in place dedicated resources on product services and customer support . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
63	45	In addition , where the total contract price is # 1000 or more , an insurance policy is in place and incorporated in the total contract price are costs incurred for the making and arranging of the policy with the necessary support and administration of 10 % . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	46	An insurance certificate will be issued to the customer once the total contract price has been paid in full . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	47	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	48	Clause 1 contains various definitions , including a definition of `` contract price '' , which is said to mean : `` The total contract price shown overleaf , or , where the context so requires , the contract price as amended in accordance with these conditions . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	49	In fact , when one looks at the box overleaf , it contains two figures for `` total contract price '' ; one '' -LRB- ex VAT -RRB- '' and one '' -LRB- inc VAT -RRB- '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	50	But a reading of the standard conditions shows that `` contract price '' or `` total contract price '' is consistently used to mean the figure inclusive of VAT , that is to say , the amount which the customer actually has to pay , see , for example , clause 6.1 : `` the ... guarantee will be enforceable provided the contract price and any other sums due in terms of the contract have been paid . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	51	Likewise in clause 6.3 itself , the reference to issuing an insurance certificate `` once the total contract price has been paid in full '' must mean payment of whatever the customer has to pay . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	52	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	53	The question then is whether the contractual document contains the `` statements '' required by Note -LRB- 5 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	54	There is no dispute that it states the amount of the premium , which is specified in clause 3.4 as # 16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	55	But the Commissioners say that it does not contain a statement `` setting out every amount that the customer is ... required to pay otherwise than by way of such premium '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	56	The reference to `` 10 % '' in clause 6.3 is in their submission inadequate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	57	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	58	No one would claim that clause 6.3 was elegantly drafted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	59	It refers to `` 10 % '' but does not say of what . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	60	However , the only candidate for being the principal sum is the `` total contract price '' , so it must mean 10 % of that . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	61	Then , as I have already commented , there is a potential ambiguity about whether this means inclusive or exclusive of VAT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	62	Again , for the reasons I have given , resort to the last words of the clause , together with other references in the document , indicate that the price inclusive of VAT was intended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	63	Even once these textual problems have been resolved , the calculation is , as the Tribunal said `` not as straightforward as it looks . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	64	It did not expand upon this observation but I think it meant that as the sum allocated to the charge for insurance services would be exempt from VAT , there could be some circularity in trying to calculate it as a percentage of the price including VAT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	65	The Tribunal stated , however , that they were `` satisfied that the amount could be ascertained from the written terms of the contract '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	66	This may have been generous to the taxpayer but was not questioned by the Extra Division on appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	67	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	68	But that , in the opinion of the Tribunal , was not enough . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	69	A statement `` setting out the amount '' meant a specific sum such as '' # 500 '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	70	What clause 6.3 provided was a `` formula '' , which was not a statement of the amount but a means by which the amount could be ascertained or calculated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	71	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	72	The Extra Division of the Court of Session -LRB- Lord Kirkwood , Lord Cameron of Lochbroom and Lord Abernethy -RRB- agreed : 2001 SC 646 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	73	The court said , at p 652 , that `` amount '' meant a `` specific monetary figure '' : `` the setting out of a calculation , even a simple calculation , by which the customer can ascertain the exact sum which he has to pay is not sufficient compliance with the provision in question , although we appreciate that in the particular circumstances of this case there is no practical difference between the monetary figure and 10 % of the total contract price . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	74	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
63	75	It seems to me that the question is whether Note -LRB- 5 -RRB- means only that the document must successfully communicate to the reader what amount or amounts he has to pay for insurance-related services or whether the information must be communicated in a particular form . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	76	A document which says in clause 1 : `` Amount to be paid : # 500 '' successfully communicates to me that I have to pay # 500 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	77	So does a document which says in clause 1 that I have to pay half the principal sum specified in clause 2 and says in clause 2 : `` Principal sum : # 1,000 '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	78	But the form of communication is different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	79	In the first case it is self-contained and uses only conventional numerical symbols . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	80	In the second it is referential and uses a simple arithmetical concept , namely division . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	81	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	82	Looking at the matter as an ordinary question of construction , which requires one to consider the language against the background of the whole statutory scheme , I think that the arguments are finely balanced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	83	The arguments on the one side are clearly stated in the views of the Tribunal and the Extra Division . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	84	They are not capable of great elaboration : that is what they thought the words meant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	85	But there are arguments on the other side as well . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	86	Note -LRB- 4 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- gives the Commissioners a specific power to prescribe the form of the document by notice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	87	It would have been open to them to say that the amount which has to be paid should appear in a box in a particular position on the front of the document in words or figures of a certain size . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	88	These are the kind of provisions one finds in consumer protection legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	89	For example , the Consumer Credit -LRB- Agreements -RRB- Regulations 1983 -LRB- SI 1983/1553 -RRB- prescribes the form and content of regulated consumer credit agreements . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	90	Article 2 and Schedule 1 require that such agreements contain specified information . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	91	Paragraph 13 of the Schedule says that they shall contain information as to the amount of each repayment -- `` expressed as -- -LRB- a -RRB- a sum of money ; -LRB- b -RRB- a specified proportion of a specified amount -LRB- including the amount outstanding from time to time -RRB- ; -LRB- c -RRB- a combination of heads -LRB- a -RRB- and -LRB- b -RRB- above ; or -LRB- d -RRB- in a case where the amount of any repayment can not be expressed in accordance with head -LRB- a -RRB- , -LRB- b -RRB- or -LRB- c -RRB- above , a statement indicating the manner in which the amount will be determined . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	92	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	93	Such provisions plainly address the form in which the information must be expressed and one might likewise have expected these matters to be prescribed by notice under Note -LRB- 4 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	94	This suggests that Note -LRB- 5 -RRB- is concerned to identify the information which the document must disclose rather than to specify any form of language or typography . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	95	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	96	In fact , in the present case there are no other formal requirements whatever . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	97	There is no objection to the information being tucked away anywhere in the small print at the back of the form . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	98	If this is allowed , it would seem capriciously fastidious for Parliament to insist that the information must be communicated in self-contained form and without requiring the reader to have any knowledge of arithmetic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	99	Despite the warning to the customer on the front that he should read the whole form -LRB- a warning which is not mandatory -RRB- , I rather doubt whether insistence on a self-contained figure would in itself contribute much to the ensuring , as the Extra Division put it , at p 652 , that `` the customer knows exactly what amount he is paying in relation to the provision of insurance services '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	100	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	101	These considerations raise the question of what purpose Note -LRB- 5 -RRB- is intended to serve . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	102	If that can be identified , it may help one to choose the meaning best calculated to advance the statutory purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	103	Mr Paines QC , who appeared for the Commissioners , said that it was intended to prevent what is known in VAT circles as `` value shifting '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
63	104	VAT is ordinarily charged not upon the market value of the goods or services supplied but upon the consideration agreed by the parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	105	It is open to the parties to agree on whatever consideration they like and provided that truly reflects what is actually paid , it is not open to challenge by the Commissioners . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	106	But when a supply of taxable goods is combined with a supply of exempt services in a single package , particularly to a consumer , there is a temptation for both parties to agree on an inflated price for the exempt services and a correspondingly lower price for the taxable goods . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	107	This is called value shifting . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	108	It suits the supplier because he gains a competitive advantage from being able to reduce his total price . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	109	It naturally suits the consumer to pay less . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	110	The only losers are the Commissioners . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	111	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	112	If , therefore , the construction put forward by the Commissioners was better calculated to prevent value shifting , that would be a powerful argument in its favour . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	113	But I have great difficulty in seeing how it does . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	114	In fact Mr Paines did not suggest that a provision requiring the contract to specify the amount charged for exempt services , even in the boldest type and most prominent position , could in itself do anything to prevent value shifting . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	115	The parties could still agree on whatever apportionment they liked . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	116	They would not be doing anything unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	117	There was no reason why they should be inhibited from value shifting by having to say what the apportionment was . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	118	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	119	Mr Paines said however that , while the Notes could not prevent value shifting , they could help to discourage it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	120	If the customer saw what appeared to be an excessive charge for insurance-related services plainly stated in the document , he might go and see whether he could get them more cheaply elsewhere . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	121	But there is more than one difficulty about this argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	122	The first is that the customer is not free to say that he will take the seller 's double glazing but wishes to shop around for insurance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	123	The taxpayer is not willing to contract on such terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	124	He is selling a single package which includes both double glazing and insurance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	125	In practice this is inevitable because the insurance is against the taxpayer becoming insolvent and such insurance is unlikely to be obtainable without the taxpayer 's co-operation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	126	So the figure which will interest the customer is not the charge for insurance but the total contract price . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	127	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	128	In response to this obvious difficulty , Mr Paines puts the argument in a weaker form , namely that an excessive charge for insurance will irritate the customer and make it more likely that he will try to find a lower overall price from another supplier . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	129	But this is also unlikely to discourage value shifting . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	130	On the contrary , if suppliers are competing on overall price , they will each want to do as much value shifting as possible , since it will enable them to charge lower overall prices inclusive of VAT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	131	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	132	It therefore seems to me that any effect which the Notes may have upon value shifting is speculative in the extreme . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	133	On the other hand , they are entirely suitable for achieving a more modest objective , which is to require the supplier to commit himself at the time of the contract to an allocation of the consideration , whatever it may be , by which he will afterwards be bound . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
63	134	That will prevent him from avoiding or evading VAT by subsequent retrospective adjustments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	135	But for this purpose , all that its necessary is that the allocation should be unequivocally stated in the document . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	136	It need not be stated in any particular form . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	137	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	138	It is interesting to note that the Commissioners in their Insurance Notice 701/36 of 1997 , Appendix B summarise the effect of Note -LRB- 5 -RRB- by saying : `` In order to treat a supply of arranging insurance as exempt , an intermediary is required to disclose the premium as well as any fee charged over and above that premium . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	139	This sounds like a requirement that information be disclosed without insistence on any particular form . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	140	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	141	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	142	for these reasons I think that even if one approaches the matter as a matter of construction of a domestic statute , the answer would not necessarily be that adopted by the Tribunal and the Extra Division . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	143	But what to my mind decisively tilts the balance against the Commissioners ' construction is the European dimension . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	144	As I said at the beginning of this speech , the exemption of insurance-related services from VAT is a mandatory requirement of article 13B -LRB- a -RRB- of the EC Sixth Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	145	A domestic rule which denies exemption to insurance-related services -LRB- as on the facts of this case Notes -LRB- 3 -RRB- to -LRB- 5 -RRB- admittedly do -RRB- is prima facie contrary to Community law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	146	The only way in which , conformably with the Directive , the United Kingdom can justify rules which deprive such services of exemption is by reliance on the provision of article 13B that exemption shall be under conditions which member states shall lay down -- `` for the purpose of ensuring the correct and straightforward application of the exemptions and of preventing any possible evasion , avoidance or abuse .

63	148	Mr Paines says that avoidance by value shifting is a form of avoidance or abuse which the United Kingdom is entitled to prevent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	149	He has the support of some remarks of Advocate General Jacobs in Muys ' en De Winter 's Bouw-en Aannemingsbedrijf BV v Staatssecretaris van Financiën -LRB- Case C-281 / 91 -RRB- -LSB- 1997 -RSB- STC 665 , 676 , para 12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	150	The Advocate General said that conditions which required a credit transaction to be `` clearly dissociable '' from an associated supply of goods would be justifiable to `` prevent evasion , avoidance or abuse '' : `` This may be of particular importance in the case of transactions between connected parties who might seek artificially to convert the consideration for a taxable supply of goods or services into consideration for an exempt grant of credit by inflating the interest rate ... '' 25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	151	The Advocate General did not enlarge upon what kind of conditions might be regarded as appropriate for this purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	152	But in general European law would require them to satisfy the principle of proportionality in its broad sense , which , following German law , is divided into three sub-principles : first , a measure must be suitable for the purpose for which the power has been conferred ; secondly , it must be necessary in the sense that the purpose could not have been achieved by some other means less burdensome to the persons affected and thirdly , it must be proportionate in the narrower sense , that is , the burdens imposed by the exercise of the power must not be disproportionate to the object to be achieved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	153	In the particular instance of conditions for allowing a VAT exemption , the Court of Justice has recently said that such conditions must be `` necessary for the attainment of the specific objective which -LSB- the legislation -RSB- pursues and have the least possible effect on the objectives and principles of the Sixth Directive '' : Ampafrance SA v Directeur des Services Fiscaux de Maine-et-Loire -LRB- Joined cases C-177 and 181/99 -RRB- -LSB- 2000 -RSB- ECR I-7013 , 7074 , para 60 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	154	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	155	The Court of Justice has acknowledged that the purpose of preventing `` evasion , avoidance or abuse '' may entitle member states to impose requirements as to the information to be contained in contractual documents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	156	For example , in Jorion v Belgium State -LRB- Joined cases 123/87 and 330/87 -LSB- 1988 -RSB- ECR 4517 it accepted that it was legitimate for Belgium to require , as a condition of a VAT deduction , that the invoice on the sale of a motor car should contain a good deal of information enabling the car to be identified and thereby to prevent substitution and fraud . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	157	But there was in that case no requirement that the information had to be provided in any particular form and the court noted , at p 4541 , para 9 , that : `` As regards invoices which are irregular as to form , the deduction is allowed when the genuine nature of the transaction is not open to doubt . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	158	In these circumstances the court said that the conditions could be justified provided only -LRB- see p 4544 , para 18 -RRB- that they did not `` by reason of their number or technical nature , render the exercise of the right of deduction practically impossible or excessively difficult . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	159	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	160	In the present case , however , I have great difficulty , for the reasons I have already explained , in seeing how a provision insisting not merely that the documents disclose the apportionment of consideration but do so in a particular form can be said to be `` suitable for the purpose '' of preventing avoidance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	161	The additional burden upon suppliers would in my opinion be disproportionate to any effect the measure would have in addressing the alleged problem . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	162	On the other hand , if the specific objective is to prevent surreptitious or retrospective value shifting , then it seems to me that all that is required is disclosure of the apportionment without insistence on any particular form . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
63	163	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	164	Mr Paines said that proportionality was concerned with imposing disproportionate burdens and that there was nothing more burdensome in imposing a requirement that the amount be stated as a self-contained figure than in requiring it to be stated referentially . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	165	Either was perfectly easy to comply with . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	166	In my opinion this is disingenuous . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	167	Any additional formal requirement , non-compliance with which may result in denial of exemption , is an additional burden . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	168	If the Note had required invoices to be on A4 paper , it could equally have been said that A4 paper was just as easy to obtain as any other kind of paper . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	169	But the imposition of such a requirement , which did nothing to advance any legitimate objective , would be disproportionate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	170	Likewise , a requirement that information be communicated in any particular form is more burdensome than a requirement that it may be communicated in any form . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	171	And where , as in this case , the addition of a requirement of form appears to serve no legitimate purpose , I think that it is also disproportionate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	172	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	173	It is the duty of a court in the United Kingdom to construe a statute , so far as possible , in conformity with European law : see Litster v Forth Dry Dock & Engineering Co Ltd 1989 SC -LRB- HL -RRB- 96 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	174	In my opinion the Commissioners ' construction does not conform to the terms of the Sixth Directive and it is therefore necessary to adopt the alternative construction which does . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	175	I would therefore allow the appeal and declare that the taxpayer is entitled to exemption for the consideration attributable to insurance-related services during the relevant period . 	lord hoffmann	self	outcome	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	176	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	177	LORD SLYNN OF HADLEY 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	178	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	179	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	180	The principal facts , the terms of the contract and the legislative provisions relevant to this appeal are set out in the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann to which I gratefully refer without repeating . 	lord slynn	lord hoffmann	factagr	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	181	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	182	If the latter is enough the question arises in the present case and no doubt in others as to whether the formula adopted is clear enough to amount to a `` statement setting out every amount '' so that the customer can readily know what is the amount . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	183	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	184	I am also in agreement with Lord Hoffmann that in interpreting the contractual terms in the present case there are difficulties about the meaning of some of the phrases used -- eg whether 10 % is 10 % of the total contract price -LRB- as like him I think it is -RRB- , whether the total contract price is inclusive or exclusive of VAT -LRB- as like him in the end I think it is -RRB- . 	lord slynn	lord hoffmann	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	185	I also have difficulties in the concept of calculating the charge for services -LRB- to be exempt from VAT -RRB- as a percentage of the price including VAT and I too think that the tribunal was generous to the taxpayer in being `` satisfied that the amount could be ascertained from the written terms of the contract '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	186	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	187	To get the benefit of the exemption from VAT on services related to the provision of insurance it is clearly mandatory that a document should be prepared `` containing the statement specified in Note 5 '' -LRB- see Notes 3 and 4 to Group 2 in Schedule 9 -LRB- and in particular Note 4 -LRB- a -RRB- -RRB- to the Value Added Tax 1994 as amended -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	188	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	189	Mr Paines laid much emphasis on the argument that the object and result of insisting on a precise figure is that it would prevent value shifting -- ie putting more of the total contract price on the exempt items and thereby reducing the basic price of the goods which are not exempt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	190	If this was the only argument I would not be satisfied that requiring a figure necessarily does , whereas stating a formula necessarily does not , prevent value shifting . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	191	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	192	But Mr Paines had another argument which in one way is linked to the value shifting argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
63	193	It is that the object of the legislation is to require the supplier to give clearly and transparently the amount of the charge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	194	That has the effect that the customer who may enter into the contract with a salesman at the door has a statement immediately obvious as to what is the amount he is charged under the various headings and in particular for `` anything that is to be , may be or has been done in pursuance of that transaction '' -LRB- Note 5 -LRB- b -RRB- to Group 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	195	It would also enable him more readily to calculate the residual amount subject to VAT and the amount of the VAT itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	196	But it would also make it less easy for a supplier to make retrospective adjustments to the various items and in particular the basic price and the administration charge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	197	It is clear that , as Lord Hoffmann points out , this could still be achieved `` if the allocation -LSB- is -RSB- unequivocally stated in the document '' . 	lord slynn	lord hoffmann	partagr	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	198	In my opinion , however , the clearest way , subject to the argument on proportionality to which I return , is to give the words their ordinary meaning -- `` set out an amount '' means `` state a figure '' rather than `` indicate a formula '' by which an amount can be calculated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	199	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	200	It is to be noted that Note 5 -LRB- a -RRB- requires that there must be `` a statement setting out the amount of the premium '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	201	That seems to me plainly to mean that the amount in money of the premium must be stated rather than that a formula be given and the words `` a statement setting out every amount '' in Note 5 -LRB- b -RRB- in my opinion should be read in the same way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	202	It is of some relevance -LRB- though of course by no means compelling -RRB- to note that in other sections of the legislation the reference to an amount seems to require a figure rather than a formula . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	203	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	204	Reference has been made to Insurance Notice 701/36 of 1997 , Appendix B in relation to Note 5 where it is said that '' -LSB- i -RSB- n order to treat a supply of arranging insurance as exempt , an intermediary is required to disclose the premium as well as any fee charged over and above that premium '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	205	I can not see that this assists the appellant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	206	It is perhaps neutral but in my view is more naturally to be read as meaning that the intermediary must tell the customer in the document what in money is the fee charged over and above the premium . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	207	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	208	I consider more relevant the provision of Note 5 -LRB- b -RRB- that it is not just `` the amount of the charge '' which is to be set out but `` every amount that the customeris to be or has been required to pay ... in connection with that transaction or anything that is to be , may be or has been done in pursuance of that transaction '' -LRB- emphasis added -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	209	This again is obviously not conclusive but in the interests of simplicity , transparency and `` a correct and straightforward '' application of such exemption -LRB- article 13 B of the Sixth VAT Directive -LRB- 77/388/EEC -RRB- -RRB- , it seems to me to indicate that for every amount for anything to be done a figure is required rather than there should be set out separate formulae . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	210	I thus agree with the reasoning of the Court of Session that as a matter of construction , amount means a specific monetary figure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	211	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	212	I reject the suggestion that by providing for an amount -LRB- a figure -RRB- to be set out rather than permitting any other means -LRB- formula or otherwise -RRB- of indicating to a customer the way in which he or his advisers can calculate the amount to be paid , the United Kingdom is in breach of its obligation under article 13 of the Sixth Directive that it shall : `` exempt the following under conditions which they shall lay down for the purpose of ensuring the correct and straightforward application of such exemptions and of preventing any possible evasion , avoidance or abuse '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	213	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	214	The member states there are clearly given a degree of discretion as to the methods they adopt and subject to the argument on proportionality it seems to me that to require a figure is no more unreasonable than requiring a formula or permitting a choice between a figure and a formula . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	215	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	216	It is said , however , that the requirements must be read in accordance with the Community law principle of proportionality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	217	That is clear ; I agree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	218	It is also said that to require a specific monetary figure is in breach of that principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	219	That I do not agree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	220	Limiting the objective to achieving clarity and transparency it seems to me that to require a figure to be stated is a suitable -LRB- the most suitable -RRB- way and is not more burdensome or disproportionate to the objective to be achieved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	221	It is said that to require someone to calculate 10 % of another figure is very easy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
63	222	That is so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
63	223	But the figure might not have been , and elsewhere might not be , 10 % . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
63	224	It might have been 17.5 % or 24.33 % . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
63	225	Moreover to say 10 % or 17.5 % of the total contract price opens up the question in the case like the present as to what figure the customer has to start with in order to calculate 10 % or 17.5 % . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
63	226	Is it # 1,000 , # 1,016 , # 1,016 plus the VAT to be calculated , before 10 % is calculated ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
63	227	How does he add on the administration charge , if that is part of the total contract price , in calculating the 10 % or the 17.5 % ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
63	228	These may all be obvious to the VAT expert but they are not necessarily obvious to the customer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
63	229	The customer is entitled to be considered in deciding what is suitable or proportionate and unduly burdensome . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
63	230	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
63	231	Moreover it seems to be at least likely that the supplier will have to calculate these figures at some stage , either for his VAT purposes or for other accounting purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
63	232	He needs to calculate the amount of 10 % or 17.5 % of the total contract price . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
63	233	It seems to me that he will have to do it sometime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
63	234	He might as well do it at the beginning and inform the customer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
63	235	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
63	236	The Crown argues that it is clear that exemptions are to be strictly construed in the VAT legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
63	237	-LRB- Stichting Uitvoering Financiële Acties v Staatssecretaris van Financiën -LRB- Case 348/1987 -RRB- -LSB- 1989 -RSB- ECR 1737 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
63	238	That submission is right but the rule does not it seems to me apply directly in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
63	239	On the other hand I can not see that any principle of Community law requires that a national court needs to be zealous in condemning a requirement laid down by a national legislature which prima facie is within its powers under article 13 to prescribe the conditions for an exemption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
63	240	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
63	241	We are here concerned not with the existence of the principle of proportionality but its application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
63	242	I consider that in the present case the purpose was legitimate and the means proportionate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
63	243	There is an advantage not only of transparency but of avoiding arguments as to whether other methods of giving an indication to the customer are clear enough -- arguments which may themselves lead to distinctions between cases more likely -LRB- than the requirement that a figure be stated -RRB- to deprive suppliers of the exemption to which article 13 entitles them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
63	244	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann

63	259	We are concerned in this case with a question as to the meaning of words in domestic legislation which was enacted to implement article 13B -LRB- a -RRB- of EC Sixth Directive -LRB- 77/388/EEC -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
63	260	Member states were required by that article to exempt insurance and reinsurance transactions , including related services performed by insurance brokers and insurance agents from VAT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
63	261	But they were permitted to attach conditions to that exemption for the purpose of ensuring its correct and straightforward application and of preventing any possible evasion , avoidance and abuse . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
63	262	This problem appears to have been approached both before the Tribunal and in the Inner House on the assumption that the meaning which was to be given to the words `` every amount '' in Note 5 -LRB- b -RRB- of the Notes to Group 2 in Schedule 9 to the Value Added Tax Act 1994 could be found by giving them their ordinary meaning according to the ordinary domestic rules of construction : 2001 SC 646 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
63	263	As a general rule however legislation which is designed to give effect to Community legislation under article 249 EC -LRB- formerly article 189 -RRB- requires to be read compatibly with that legislation as explained by the decisions of the European Court of Justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
63	264	It will rarely , if ever , be satisfactory to ignore the principles which have been laid down by the European Court of Justice in the relevant case law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
63	265	The parties are now agreed that the sole issue in the appeal to your Lordships is whether the terms of the taxpayer 's standard form contract satisfied the requirements of Note 5 -LRB- b -RRB- read compatibly with the opening words of article 13B and 13B -LRB- a -RRB- of the Sixth Directive .

63	267	In Litster v Forth Dry Dock & Engineering Co Ltd 1989 SC -LRB- HL -RRB- 96 , the point that was in issue was the meaning of the words `` immediately before '' in regulation 5 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Transfer of Undertakings -LRB- Protection of Employment -RRB- Regulations 1981 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
63	268	Those regulations were designed to give effect to Council Directive -LRB- 77/187/EEC -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
63	269	As Lord Keith of Kinkel said , at p 101 , it was the duty of the court to give regulation 5 a construction which accorded with decisions of the European court upon the corresponding provisions of the Directive to which the regulation was intended by Parliament to give effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
63	270	In this case the question is whether the provision of a formula by which the amount of the fee for arranging insurance could be ascertained was sufficient to satisfy the requirement in Note 5 -LRB- b -RRB- to set out the `` amount '' of the fee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
63	271	If it was not , the relevant requirements for the purposes of Note 3 will not have been fulfilled and the taxpayer will be deprived of the exemption from VAT which article 13 of the Sixth Directive provides and which the domestic legislation was designed to implement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
63	272	It is settled case law that any derogations from rules intended to guarantee the effectiveness of rights recognised by the EC Treaty must be interpreted strictly : see Richard Brent , Directives : Rights and Remedies in English and Community Law -LRB- 2001 -RRB- , p 119 , para 11.14 .

NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
63	274	50 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
63	275	In my opinion it is far from clear that the phrase `` a statement setting out every amount '' in Note 5 -LRB- b -RRB- , giving the words their ordinary meaning and reading them in context , are incapable of including a formula by which the figure which represented the fee for arranging the insurance could be ascertained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
63	276	The Tribunal held that the monetary figure could be ascertained from the information in the contract , and in the Inner House it was appreciated that there was no practical difference between the monetary figure and 10 % of the contract price : 2001 SC 646 , 652C , para 13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
63	277	There has been no suggestion of an intention on the taxpayer 's part to evade , avoid or abuse the exemption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
