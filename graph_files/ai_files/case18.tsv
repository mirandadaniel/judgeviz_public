18	5	I have had the advantage of reading the text of the speech prepared by my noble and learned friend , Lord Scott of Foscote . 	lord slynn	lord scott	ackn	0	lord scott
18	6	The key to the decision in this case is , as Mr Kenneth Parker argued , that regulation 32 of the Value Added Tax -LRB- General -RRB- Regulations 1985 -LRB- SI 1985/886 -RRB- , provides a separate code for determining the amount of input tax relevant to the making of out-of-country supplies which is distinct from the code in regulation 30 where , as Nourse LJ rightly thought plain , `` taxable supplies '' do not include out-of-country supplies -LSB- 1999 -RSB- STC 424 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord scott
18	7	Moreover I see nothing in article 17.5 of the Sixth Council Directive -LRB- 77/388/EEC -RRB- which precludes the adoption of regulation 32 of the 1985 Regulations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord scott

18	17	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
18	18	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
18	19	The key question on the issue about the validity of regulation 32 of the Value Added Tax -LRB- General -RRB- Regulations 1985 -LRB- SI 1985/886 -RRB- , is the extent of the discretion which the Sixth Council Directive -LRB- 77/388/EEC -RRB- allows to member states as to the means of determining the recoverable proportion of residual input tax . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
18	20	Like my noble and learned friend , Lord Scott of Foscote , whose speech I have had the advantage of reading in draft , I can find nothing in regulation 32 of the 1985 Regulations which is inconsistent with article 17.5 of the Directive . 	lord hope	lord scott	ackn	0.1	lord scott
18	20	Like my noble and learned friend , Lord Scott of Foscote , whose speech I have had the advantage of reading in draft , I can find nothing in regulation 32 of the 1985 Regulations which is inconsistent with article 17.5 of the Directive . 	lord hope	lord scott	partagr	0.1	lord scott
18	21	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
18	22	Out-of-country transactions are dealt with separately in article 17.3 from those mentioned in article 17.2 on which value added tax is due and payable in this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
18	23	The two types of transaction are brought together for the purposes of residual input tax by the first indent of article 17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
18	24	But that indent does not lay down the method by which the relevant proportion is to be calculated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
18	25	That is left to the two remaining indents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
18	26	Sub-paragraph -LRB- c -RRB- of the third indent leaves it open to member states to depart from the value-based method in article 19 laid down by the second indent for the purpose of calculating the deduction for part of the taxable person 's goods and services , while using value-based method for the rest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
18	27	I think that this provision is clearly broad enough to enable out-of-country supplies , which article 17 itself recognises are different from supplies which are taxable in this country , to be treated differently . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
18	28	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
18	29	I also agree with my noble and learned friend , for the reasons which he has given , that regulation 32 provides a separate regime for determining the amount of input tax used in making out-of-country supplies from that provided by regulation 30 for taxable supplies and exempt supplies . 	lord hope	lord scott	NAN	0.1	lord scott
18	30	This reading of the regulations is reinforced by the fact that regulation 30 -LRB- 1 -RRB- states that the method which that regulation lays down is subject to regulation 31 -LRB- which is headed `` Use of other methods '' -RRB- , and that regulation 31 -LRB- 1 -RRB- states that that regulation is in its turn subject to regulation 32 -LRB- which is headed `` Attribution of input tax to foreign and specified supplies '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
18	31	I too would hold that in this context the expression `` taxable supplies '' in regulation 30 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- d -RRB- means supplies in the United Kingdom and that it does not include out-of-country supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott

18	43	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
18	44	The issue in this appeal is the method to be adopted for calculating the amount of input tax for which the appellants , the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts -LRB- LIPA -RRB- , were entitled to credit when making their VAT returns . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
18	45	The issue turns on the construction to be given to regulations 30 -LRB- attribution of input tax to taxable supplies -RRB- and 32 -LRB- attribution of input tax to foreign and specified supplies -RRB- of the Value Added Tax -LRB- General -RRB- Regulations 1985 -LRB- SI 1985/886 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
18	46	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
18	47	The 1985 Regulations were made in exercise of the power conferred by section 15 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Value Added Tax Act 1983 : `` The Commissioners shall make regulations for securing a fair and reasonable attribution of input tax to supplies ... and any such regulations may provide for -- -LRB- a -RRB- determining a proportion by reference to which input tax for any prescribed accounting period is to be provisionally attributed to those supplies ; '' The 1985 Regulations were made under this empowering provision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
18	48	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
18	49	Your Lordships have been urged by Mr Cordara , counsel for LIPA , to construe the domestic legislation in the light of the Sixth Council Directive -LRB- 77/388/EEC -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
18	50	He says that Nourse LJ , who gave the leading judgment in the Court of Appeal , failed to do so -LSB- 1999 -RSB- STC 424 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
18	51	It is convenient , therefore , to precede an examination of the relevant provisions of domestic legislation with an examination of the relevant provisions of the Sixth Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
18	52	First , however , I should refer in brief to the facts that have given rise to this litigation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
18	53	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
18	54	Since 1995 LIPA has provided educational services in the field of performing arts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
18	55	The supply of educational services does not attract VAT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
18	56	It is an exempt supply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
18	57	But LIPA , over three periods identified by the judge , Carnwath J , provided advertising and publicity services to a German company , Grundig AG . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
18	58	The supply of these services , if the place of supply had been the United Kingdom , would have attracted VAT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
18	59	It is common ground , however , that , by virtue of article 16 of the Value Added Tax -LRB- Place of Supply of Services -RRB- Order 1992 -LRB- SI 1992/3121 -RRB- , supplies of advertising are treated as made where the recipient belongs ie , in this case , in Germany . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
18	60	So LIPA 's supply of advertising services to Grundig was an out-of-country supply that would , had it been a supply made in this country , have attracted VAT in this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
18	61	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
18	62	VAT is a tax on the supply of goods or services in course or furtherance of a business -LRB- section 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1983 Act -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
18	63	But in order to supply goods or services that attract VAT -LRB- the output tax -RRB- it will almost always be necessary for the supplier to utilise goods and services that have been supplied to him and that , in turn , will have attracted VAT -LRB- the input tax -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
18	64	It is a fundamental principle , a golden rule , of the VAT system that the VAT taxpayer is entitled to deduct the input tax on the goods and services supplied to him and that he has used for the purpose of making goods and services that he supplies from the output tax on those goods and services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
18	65	He must account to the Commissioners of Customs and Excise for only the net amount -LRB- section 14 of the 1983 Act -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
18	66	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
18	67	The purpose of the Sixth Directive was to harmonize the VAT laws of member states . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
18	68	As to input tax deductions , recital 12 said this : `` Whereas the rules governing deductions should be harmonized to the extent that they affect the actual amounts collected ; whereas the deductible proportion should be calculated in a similar manner in all the member states ; '' 14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
18	69	Article 2 expressed the general principle of VAT : `` The following shall be subject to Value Added Tax : 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
18	70	the supply of goods or services effected for consideration within the territory of the country by a taxable person acting as such ; 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
18	71	the importation of goods . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
18	72	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
18	73	Article 9 laid down the general rule that `` the place where a service is supplied shall be deemed to be the place where the supplier has established his business '' but then provided for a number of exceptions , which included the supply of advertising services , where the place of supply was to be `` the place where the customer has established his business '' -LRB- paragraph -LRB- e -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
18	74	Hence , article 16 of the 1992 Order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
18	75	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
18	76	Article 17 of the Sixth Directive dealt with deductions of input tax . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
18	77	Paragraphs 2 , 3 and 5 are important . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
18	78	So far as relevant to the issues in this case , they provided as follows : `` 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
18	79	In so far as the goods and services are used for the purposes of his taxable transactions , the taxable person shall be entitled to deduct from the tax which he is liable to pay : -LRB- a -RRB- value added tax due or paid in respect of goods or services supplied or to be supplied to him by another taxable person ; 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
18	80	Member states shall also grant to every taxable person the right to a deduction or refund of the value added tax referred to in paragraph 2 in so far as the goods and services are used for the purposes of : -LRB- a -RRB- transactions relating to the economic activities carried out in another country , which would be eligible for deduction of tax if they had occurred in the territory of the country ; 5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
18	81	As regards goods and services to be used by a taxable person both for transactions covered by paragraphs 2 and 3 , in respect of which value added tax is deductible , and for transactions in respect of which value added tax is not deductible , only such proportion of the value added tax shall be deductible as is attributable to the former transactions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
18	82	This proportion shall be determined , in accordance with article 19 , for all the transactions carried out by the taxable person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
18	83	However , member states may : -LRB- c -RRB- authorize or compel the taxable person to make the deduction on the basis of the use of all or part of the goods and services ; -LRB- d -RRB- authorize or compel the taxable person to make the deduction in accordance with the rule laid down in the first subparagraph , in respect of all goods and services used for all transactions referred to therein ; '' 17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
18	84	Article 19 provides a formula for the calculation of the proportion referred to in article 17 -LRB- 5 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
18	85	The formula is value based . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
18	86	`` 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
18	87	The proportion deductible under the first subparagraph of article 17 -LRB- 5 -RRB- shall be made up of a fraction having : -- as numerator , the total amount , exclusive of value added tax , of turnover per year attributable to transactions in respect of which value added tax is deductible under article 17 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and -LRB- 3 -RRB- , -- as denominator , the total amount , exclusive of value added tax , of turnover per year attributable to transactions included in the numerator and to transactions in respect of which value added tax is not deductible . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
18	88	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
18	89	The operation of article 17 presents no problems where the input goods and services are used exclusively for the purpose of the taxable person 's `` taxable transactions '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
18	90	In that case the whole of the input tax paid in respect of those goods and services is deductible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
18	91	Nor is there any problem where the input goods and services are used exclusively for the purpose of transactions that do not attract VAT eg exempt transactions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
18	92	In that case none of the input tax paid in respect of those goods and services is deductible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
18	93	The problem only arises in relation to so-called `` residual input tax '' ie input tax on goods and services which are used indiscriminately for all transactions of the taxable person , some of which attract VAT , some of which are exempt from VAT , and some of which , eg gratuitous transactions not made for business purposes , may fall outside the VAT system . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
18	94	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
18	95	In relation to these , some formula or criteria are needed in order to determine the amount of the residual input tax that is deductible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
18	96	Article 17 -LRB- 5 -RRB- proposes the article 19 formula but , under the `` However ... . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
18	97	part of the paragraph , allows member states some flexibility to make other provision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
18	98	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
18	99	I can now turn to the domestic legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
18	100	Section 1 of the 1983 Act provides for VAT to `` be charged on the supply of goods and services in the United Kingdom '' And section 2 says that `` a taxable supply is a supply of goods or services made in the United Kingdom other than an exempt supply '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
18	101	Section 15 provides that : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- The amount of input tax for which a taxable person is entitled to credit at the end of any period shall be so much of the input tax for the period ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
18	102	as is allowable by or under regulations as being attributable to supplies within subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- below . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
18	103	-LRB- 2 -RRB- The supplies within this subsection are the following supplies made or to be made by the taxable person in the course or furtherance of his business -- -LRB- a -RRB- taxable supplies ; -LRB- b -RRB- supplies outside the United Kingdom which would be taxable supplies if made in the United Kingdom ; '' 21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
18	104	I have already referred to the regulation making power conferred by subsection -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
18	105	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
18	106	These legislative provisions are entirely in accordance with the scheme imposed by the Sixth Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
18	107	Input tax attributable to `` taxable supplies '' , which will necessarily be limited to supplies in the United Kingdom -LRB- see section 2 of the Act -RRB- , or to out-of-country supplies that would have been taxable supplies if made in the United Kingdom are deductible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
18	108	As to the deduction of residual input tax , it is necessary to turn to the 1985 Regulations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
18	109	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
18	110	Regulation 30 is headed `` Attribution of input tax to taxable supplies '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
18	111	Paragraph -LRB- 1 -RRB- provides , so far as relevant to this case , as follows : `` Subject to regulation 31 below , the amount of input tax which a taxable person shall be entitled to deduct provisionally shall be that amount which is attributable to taxable supplies in accordance with this regulation . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
18	112	One would suppose that `` taxable supplies '' in this paragraph must have the same meaning as in the empowering Act , namely , '' ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
18	113	a supply of goods and services made in the United Kingdom other than an exempt supply '' -LRB- see section 2 of the Act -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
18	114	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
18	115	Paragraph -LRB- 2 -RRB- provides : `` In respect of each prescribed accounting period : -LRB- b -RRB- there shall be attributed to taxable supplies the whole of the input tax on such of those goods or services as are used or to be used by him exclusively in making taxable supplies ; -LRB- c -RRB- no part of the input tax on such of those goods or services as are used or to be used by him exclusively in making exempt supplies , or in carrying on any activity other than the making of taxable supplies , shall be attributed to taxable supplies ; '' Here , too , `` taxable supplies '' must have the same meaning it would have had in the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
18	116	Supplies made `` in carrying on any activity other than the making of taxable supplies '' would , apart from exempt supplies which are expressly mentioned , be apt to cover out-of-country supplies and supplies made otherwise than in the course or furtherance of a business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
18	117	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
18	118	Paragraph -LRB- 2 -RRB- continues : '' -LRB- d -RRB- there shall be attributed to taxable supplies such proportion of the input tax on such of those goods or services as are used or to be used by him in making both taxable and exempt supplies as bears the same ratio to the total of such input tax as the value of taxable supplies made by him bears to the value of all supplies made by him in the period . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
18	119	This sub-paragraph is dealing with residual input tax . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
18	120	It prescribes a value-based method of apportionment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
18	121	Some of the difficulties it presents are immediately apparent , others only become apparent , to me at least , after several re-readings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
18	122	First , `` taxable supplies '' must , surely , have the same meaning here as elsewhere in regulation 30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
18	123	It must be limited to supplies in the United Kingdom that are taxable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
18	124	It must , therefore , exclude exempt supplies , out-of-country supplies and supplies made otherwise than in the course or furtherance of a business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
18	125	None of these constitutes `` taxable supplies '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
18	126	But what does `` all supplies '' mean ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
18	127	Is there any category of supplies that should be excluded ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
18	128	If so , which and why ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
18	129	I will return to these questions , which are critical to the outcome of this appeal , after I have referred to regulation 32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
18	130	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
18	131	Paragraph -LRB- 3 -RRB- of regulation 30 specifies a number of items that are to be excluded in calculating the paragraph -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- d -RRB- proportion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
18	132	None bears upon , or assists in the resolution of , any issue in this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
18	133	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
18	134	Regulation 31 allows the commissioners , subject to regulation 32 , to prescribe a method for apportioning residual input tax other than the method prescribed under regulation 30 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- d -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
18	135	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
18	136	Regulation 32 is headed `` Attribution of input tax to foreign and specified supplies '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
18	137	Paragraph -LRB- 1 -RRB- provides as follows : `` Input tax incurred by a taxable person in any prescribed accounting period on goods imported or acquired by , or goods or services supplied to , him which are used or to be used by him in whole or in part in making -- -LRB- a -RRB- supplies outside the United Kingdom which would be taxable supplies if made in the United Kingdom ; . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
18	138	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
18	139	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
18	140	shall be attributed to taxable supplies to the extent that the goods or services are so used or to be used , expressed as a proportion of the whole use or intended use . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
18	141	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
18	142	It is apparent that under regulation 32 the apportionment of input tax is to be carried out on a `` use '' basis , by contrast with the article 19 apportionment or an apportionment under regulation 30 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- d -RRB- , which contemplate a value-based apportionment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
18	143	So much is , I think , common ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
18	144	But very little , if anything , else as to the meaning and effect of regulation 32 is common ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
18	145	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
18	146	The tribunal , reading regulation 32 with regulation 30 , concluded that the use-based approach required by regulation 32 should be applied in order to determine the proportion of residual input tax attributable to LIPA 's out-of-country supplies to Grundig but that once that amount of residual input tax had been so determined , the out-of - country supplies should , for all regulation 30 purposes , be treated as `` taxable supplies '' -LRB- see paragraph 88 of the decision -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
18	147	The consequence of this would be , first , that the amount of input tax attributable to out-of - country supplies would be deductible under paragraph -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- of regulation 30 -LRB- see paragraph 89 of the tribunal decision -RRB- , and , second , in a case where the supplies made by the taxpayer included out-of-country taxable supplies , exempt supplies and in-country taxable supplies , regulation 30 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- d -RRB- would come into play with the `` taxable supplies '' numerator including both in-country and out-of-country taxable supplies and with the `` all supplies '' denominator including those supplies plus the exempt supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
18	148	Presumably the `` all supplies '' denominator would also include non-business supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
18	149	The paragraph -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- d -RRB- fraction would be applied to the residual input tax after deduction therefrom of the amount of input tax determined under regulation 32 as being attributable to the out-of-country supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott

18	151	Carnwath J agreed with the tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
18	152	He said -LSB- 1998 -RSB- STC 274 , 282 : '' ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
18	153	regulation 32 is ancillary to regulation 30 and simply designed to ensure that out-of-country supplies are -LRB- in line with the scheme of the Sixth Directive -RRB- treated in the same way as taxable supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
18	154	This means , in effect , treating the word ` taxable supplies ' in regulation 30 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- d -RRB- in other than its ordinary sense . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
18	155	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
18	156	The Court of Appeal disagreed : -LSB- 1999 -RSB- STC 424 with whose judgment Judge and Tuckey LJJ agreed , thought that `` taxable supplies '' in regulation 30 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- d -RRB- , and elsewhere in regulation 30 , had the meaning given by section 2 of the Act ie excluding out-of-country taxable supplies and that `` all supplies '' meant taxable supplies and exempt supplies and did not include out-of-country supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
18	157	He held , at p 430 , that regulation 32 `` was intended to constitute a separate regime for out-of - country and specified supplies '' ie separate from the regulation 30 regime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
18	158	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
18	159	Mr Cordara , in seeking on behalf of LIPA to overturn the Court of Appeal and uphold the tribunal and Carnwath J , had essentially two submissions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
18	160	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
18	161	He submitted that article 17.5 , coupled with article 19 , required a value-based approach to the apportionment of residual input tax as between supplies in respect of which input tax could be recovered ie in-country taxable supplies and out-of-country supplies that would have been taxable if they had been in-country supplies -LRB- article 17.2 and 17.3 -RRB- and supplies in respect of which input tax could not be deducted , eg exempt supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
18	162	Regulation 30 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- d -RRB- provided that value-based apportionment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
18	163	Regulation 32 was confined to determining the amount of input tax to be attributed to the out-of-country supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
18	164	It did not prevent the out-of-country supplies , which would have been taxable if made in-country , from being `` taxable supplies '' for all regulation 30 purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
18	165	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
18	166	But , if the Court of Appeal were right in regarding regulation 32 as a self-contained provision that removed out-of-country supplies for all purposes from regulation 30 , then , submitted Mr Cordara , regulation 32 was inconsistent with articles 17.5 and 19 and , at least to the extent of the inconsistency , must give way to the provisions of the Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
18	167	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
18	168	I am unable to accept these submissions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
18	169	In order to explain why not it is convenient to start with article 17.5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
18	170	I accept that article 17.5 , coupled with article 19 , contemplates a value-based approach to apportionment of residual input tax . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
18	171	But it does not insist on it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
18	172	Sub-paragraph -LRB- c -RRB- allows member states to bring into effect a regime under which the taxable person is required `` to make the deduction on the basis of the use of all or part of the goods or services '' , ie an apportionment on the basis of use . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
18	173	Regulation 32 requires an apportionment to be made on the basis of use . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
18	174	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
18	175	The regulation 32 use-based apportionment applies only in respect of out-of-country supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
18	176	Where input goods and services are used in part in making out-of-country supplies and in part in making in-country supplies , article 17.5 -LRB- c -RRB- does not , Mr Cordara submitted , enable a use-based apportionment to be imposed in respect of the out-of - country supplies with a value-based apportionment applying in respect of the in-country supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
18	177	He submitted , as I understood it , that there must be one regime , and one regime only , either the value-based regime of article 19 or a use-based regime imposed under article 17.5 -LRB- c -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
18	178	I do not accept that article 17.5 -LRB- c -RRB- requires this one regime approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
18	179	Sub-paragraph -LRB- c -RRB- refers to apportionment `` on the basis of the use of all or part of the goods and services '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
18	180	The `` goods and services '' referred to are the input goods and services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
18	181	So a use-based apportionment can be prescribed in respect of the input tax on some of the goods and services , leaving the input tax on the other goods and services to be apportioned by a value-based method . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
18	182	There can , therefore , be two regimes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
18	183	It is true that regulation 32 does not split the input goods and services into some to which the use-based apportionment applies and others to which the regulation 30 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- d -RRB- value-based apportionment applies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
18	184	The regulation applies to all the goods and services used , or to be used , in making the out-of-country supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
18	185	But since there is no express restriction that prevents the use-based apportionment being applied only in respect of out-of-country supplies and since article 17.5 -LRB- c -RRB- contemplates that more than one basis of apportionment may be applicable in order to identify the amount of input tax deductible under article 17.3 , I can see nothing in regulation 32 that is inconsistent with the article 17 scheme . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
18	186	In my opinion , the attack on the validity of regulation 32 fails . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
18	187	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
18	188	Regulation 32 enables the amount of input tax used in making out-of-country supplies to be determined . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
18	189	The tax thus determined is tax attributable to supplies within subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- of section 15 of the 1983 Act and , accordingly , is tax for which the taxpayer is entitled to credit under section 14 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
18	190	It is not necessary for the supplies to be `` taxable supplies '' under regulation 30 in order for the taxpayer to be so entitled . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
18	191	I agree , therefore , with the Court of Appeal that regulation 32 provides a separate regime for out-of-country supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
18	192	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
18	193	There remain difficulties of construction of regulation 30 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- d -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
18	194	In paragraph 2 -LRB- d -RRB- , and everywhere else in the regulation , `` taxable supplies '' means , in my opinion , supplies in the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
18	195	The meaning accords within the definition in section 2 of the Act -LRB- cf regulation 36 where `` taxable supplies '' is expressly given a different , extended meaning -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
18	196	`` All supplies '' in paragraph 2 -LRB- d -RRB- does not , in my opinion , include out-of-country supplies that would , if made in the United Kingdom , have been taxable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
18	197	Those supplies are dealt with under regulation 32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
18	198	`` Exempt supplies '' , on the other hand , does include supplies made outside the United Kingdom that would be exempt if made in the United Kingdom -LRB- see regulation 29 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- -LRB- ii -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
18	199	Otherwise the paragraph -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- d -RRB- fraction would produce a distorted result . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
18	200	I am , however , not clear how paragraph -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- d -RRB- is intended to apply where the input goods and services have been used in making not only taxable supplies and exempt supplies but also non-business supplies -LRB- cf paragraph -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- - `` used ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
18	201	in carrying on any other activity ... . '' -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
18	202	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
18	203	Presumably these supplies , too , should be included under `` all supplies '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
18	204	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
18	205	The present case , however , does not involve non-business supplies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
18	206	It involves only taxable supplies , exempt supplies and supplies that would have been taxable if made in-country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
18	207	As to these , in my opinion , the Court of Appeal came to the correct conclusions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
18	208	I would dismiss the appeal . 	lord scott	self	outcome	1	lord scott
