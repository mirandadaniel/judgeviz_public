53	1	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	2	LORD NICHOLLS OF BIRKENHEAD 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	4	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	5	Counterfeit goods and pirated goods are big business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	6	They account for between 5 % and 7 % of world trade . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	7	They are estimated to cost the economy of this country some # 9 billion each year . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	8	Counterfeit goods comprise cheap imitations of the authentic article , sold under the trade mark of the authentic article , as with imitation ` Rolex ' watches . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	9	Pirated goods comprise illicit copies of the authentic article which are not sold under the trade mark of the authentic article . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	10	This would happen , for instance , when a person makes and sells unauthorised copies of computer software which is the subject of copyright . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	11	Thus , in the context of music recordings , a counterfeit compact disc is an unlawful copy of , say , a Virgin compact disc sold ostensibly as a Virgin product . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	12	A pirated compact disc is an unlawful copy of , in my example , a Virgin compact disc which is sold , not as a Virgin product , but under a different brand name . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	13	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	14	Another type of unlawful trading is ` bootlegging ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	15	Like counterfeit records and pirated records , bootleg records are also big business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	16	They comprise copies of an unlawful recording of a performance at a live concert . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	17	The recording is made at an auditorium or taken from a radio or television broadcast . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	18	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	19	Most bootleg products sold in this country are in compact disc format . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	20	They are mainly manufactured abroad and imported into this country without cases or paperwork . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	21	The importer then packages the discs , with created paperwork , into locally obtained cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	22	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	23	So it was with the subject matter of the present appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	24	The present appeal relates to copies , in the form of compact discs , of bootleg recordings made of performances by well known performers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	25	The case concerns the use , in connection with these compact discs , of the criminal sanctions contained in the trade marks legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	26	Questions about trade marks arise in this context in the following way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	27	When sold to the public each of these compact discs bears , in the usual manner , the name of the performer whose performance is recorded on the disc : Rolling Stones , or Beatles , or whoever it may be . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	28	This name also appears on the accompanying paperwork inside the disc 's case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	29	Nowadays leading performers register their professional names as trade marks in respect of recordings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	30	So , it is said , sales of the discs labelled in this way constitute infringements of the performers ' registered trade marks . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	31	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	32	The case arises out of the ` bootlegging ' activities of Mr Robert Johnstone , the respondent to this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	33	His activities only came to light because of a misdirected parcel . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	34	Mrs Luddington lives in Hemel Hempstead . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	35	In October 1997 she was surprised to receive a large box . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	36	It contained 519 compact discs and associated artwork . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	37	The box had been mistakenly posted to her by Mr Johnstone from his home address in New Malden . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	38	Mrs Luddington notified Polygram Records , whose head of security retrieved the box and contacted the police . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	39	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	40	Police officers then searched Mr Johnstone 's home . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	41	They were accompanied by a representative of the trade body , British Phonographic Industry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	42	Some 500 compact discs and audio cassettes were seized during the search . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	43	The investigator from BPI considered that most of the compact discs found , as well as those sent by error to Mrs Luddington , were bootleg recordings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	44	Mr Johnstone was charged with having committed criminal offences under section 92 of the Trade Marks Act 1994 -LRB- ` the 1994 Act ' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	45	The statutory provisions 7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	46	Before elaborating further , and in order to explain the point of law which has arisen , I should refer briefly to the relevant statutory provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	47	Part I of the 1994 Act concerns registered trade marks . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	48	Section 1 defines a trade mark as any sign capable of being represented graphically which is capable of distinguishing goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	49	A trade mark may consist of words , including personal names . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	50	The proprietor of a registered trade mark has the rights and remedies provided by the Act : see section 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	51	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	52	Sections 9 to 13 comprise a fasciculus of sections setting out the effect of a registered trade mark . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	53	Section 9 -LRB- 1 -RRB- provides that the proprietor of a registered trade mark has the exclusive rights in the trade mark ` which are infringed by use of the trade mark in the United Kingdom without his consent ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	54	The acts amounting to infringement if done without the consent of the proprietor are stated in section 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	55	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	56	Section 10 deals with several different situations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	57	Section 10 -LRB- 1 -RRB- concerns the case where a person in the course of trade uses a sign identical with a registered trade mark in relation to goods identical with those for which it is registered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	58	Such use constitutes infringement : ' -LRB- 1 -RRB- A person infringes a registered trade mark if he uses in the course of trade a sign which is identical with the trade mark in relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which it is registered . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	59	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	60	Section 10 -LRB- 2 -RRB- addresses cases where either -LRB- a -RRB- a sign identical with a registered trade mark is used in relation to goods similar to those for which the trade mark is registered or -LRB- b -RRB- a sign similar to a registered trade mark is used in relation to goods identical with or similar to those for which the trade mark is registered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	61	In such cases user constitutes infringement if there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	62	Section 10 -LRB- 3 -RRB- concerns cases where a sign identical with or similar to a registered trade mark is used in relation to goods not similar to those for which the trade mark is registered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	63	Then , in short , user constitutes infringement where the trade mark has a reputation within the United Kingdom and the sign takes unfair advantage of , or is detrimental to , the distinctive character or the repute of the trade mark . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	64	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	65	One of the ingredients of infringement as described in section 10 -LRB- 1 -RRB- to -LRB- 3 -RRB- is the ` use ' of a sign by a person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	66	Section 10 -LRB- 4 -RRB- gives some examples of what this means . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	67	A person uses a sign if he affixes the sign to goods or its packaging , or if he offers goods for sale under the sign . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	68	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	69	Section 11 specifies some limits on the effect of a registered trade mark . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	70	Section 11 -LRB- 2 -RRB- provides : ' -LRB- 2 -RRB- A registered trade mark is not infringed by - -LRB- a -RRB- the use by a person of his own name or address , -LRB- b -RRB- the use of indications concerning the kind , quality , quantity , intended purpose , value , geographical origin , the time of production of goods or of rendering of services , or other characteristics of goods or services , or -LRB- c -RRB- the use of the trade mark where it is necessary to indicate the intended purpose of a product or service -LRB- in particular , as accessories or spare parts -RRB- , provided the use is in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	71	Trade mark use : indication of trade origin 13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	72	The message conveyed by a trade mark has developed over the years , with changing patterns in the conduct of business : see the discussion in Scandecor Developments AB v Scandecor Marketing AB -LRB- 4 April 2001 , UKHL 21 of 2001 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	73	But the essence of a trade mark has always been that it is a badge of origin . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	74	It indicates trade source : a connection in the course of trade between the goods and the proprietor of the mark . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	75	That is its function . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	76	Hence the exclusive rights granted to the proprietor of a registered trade mark are limited to use of a mark likely to be taken as an indication of trade origin . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	77	Use of this character is an essential prerequisite to infringement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	78	Use of a mark in a manner not indicative of trade origin of goods or services does not encroach upon the proprietor 's monopoly rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	79	Dillon LJ observed trenchantly in Mothercare UK Ltd v Penguin Books -LSB- 1988 -RSB- RPC 113 , 118 : ` it stands to reason that a Trade Marks Act would only be concerned to restrict the use of a mark as a trade mark or in a trade mark sense , and should be construed accordingly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	80	If descriptive words are legitimately registered -LSB- as a trade mark -RSB- , there is still no reason why other people should not be free to use the words in a descriptive sense , and not in any trade mark sense . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	81	In this regard I can not forbear adding the extreme hypothetical example beloved of trade mark lawyers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	82	If a magazine publisher were to register an ordinary question mark , ' ? ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	83	, as a trade mark for magazines this would not prevent the grammatical use of question marks on the covers of other magazines . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	84	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	85	This fundamental principle , limiting the scope of the rights of the proprietor of a registered trade mark , was well established under the early trade marks legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	86	It was carried forward expressly into section 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Trade Marks Act 1938 -LRB- ` being used as a trade mark ' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	87	Section 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- muddied the waters a little . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	88	The wording of section 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- gave rise to an unresolved controversy over whether , and to what extent , this paragraph further extended the rights of a proprietor : see the discussion in Kerly 's Law of Trade Marks , 12th ed , -LRB- 1986 -RRB- , pp 263-265 and the authorities cited there . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	89	This controversy is now of no more than historic interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	90	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	91	Against this background I turn to the 1994 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	92	Section 10 -LRB- 1 -RRB- to -LRB- 3 -RRB- specifies the acts which constitute infringement , but there is no express statement that the offending use must be use as a trade mark . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	93	I would not regard this as sufficient reason to suppose that Parliament intended to depart from such a basic principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	94	But on this , as so much else in the law of trade marks , it is necessary to look for guidance beyond the confines of the 1994 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	95	One of the main purposes of this statute was to implement EEC Council Directive 89/104 of 21 December 1988 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	96	This directive , which I shall call ` the trade mark directive ' , was concerned with harmonising the trade mark laws of member states . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	97	Articles 5 and 6 of the directive made provision regarding the rights conferred by a trade mark and the limits of those rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	98	Sections 10 and 11 of the 1994 Act give effect to these two articles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	99	So authoritative guidance on the interpretation of section 10 now comes from the European Court of Justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	100	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	101	For some time questions were raised on whether , given its derivation from article 5 of the trade mark directive , non-trade mark use could be caught by sections 10 -LRB- 1 -RRB- to -LRB- 3 -RRB- : see British Sugar Plc v James Robertson & Sons Ltd -LSB- 1996 -RSB- RPC 281 , 291 , per Jacob J , Philips Electronics NV v Remington Consumer Products -LSB- 1998 -RSB- RPC 283 , 311-312 , per Jacob J , and in the Court of Appeal , -LSB- 1999 -RSB- RPC 809 , 823 , per Aldous LJ . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	102	These doubts must now be regarded as laid to rest by the decision of the European Court in the ` football souvenirs ' case of Arsenal Football Club plc v Reed -LSB- 2003 -RSB- RPC 144 , 165 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	103	The court , at p 171 , para 48 , re-affirmed its characterisation of the purpose of a trade mark in terms which accord with the approach of English law : ` the essential function of a trade mark is to guarantee the identity of origin of the marked goods or services to the consumer or end user by enabling him , without any possibility of confusion , to distinguish the goods or services from others which have another origin . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	104	For the trade mark to be able to fulfil its essential role in the system of undistorted competition which the Treaty seeks to establish and maintain , it must offer a guarantee that all the goods or services bearing it have been manufactured or supplied under the control of a single undertaking which is responsible for their quality ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	105	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	106	The court then considered , at p 172 , paras 51-54 , the scope of the exclusive right conferred on the proprietor of a trade mark under article 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the trade mark directive , which corresponds to section 10 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the 1994 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	107	The court held that the scope of this right is co-terminous with the function of registered trade marks : ` the exclusive right under Article 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Directive was conferred in order to enable the trade mark proprietor to protect his specific interests as proprietor , that is , to ensure that the trade mark can fulfil its functions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	108	The exercise of that right must therefore be reserved to cases in which a third party 's use of the sign affects or is liable to affect the functions of the trade mark , in particular its essential function of guaranteeing to consumers the origin of the goods . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	109	The exclusive nature of the right conferred by a registered trade mark on its proprietor under Article 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Directive can be justified only within the limits of the application of that article . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	110	... The proprietor may not prohibit the use of a sign identical to the trade mark for goods identical to those for which the mark is registered if that use can not affect his own interests as proprietor of the mark , having regard to its functions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	111	Thus certain uses for purely descriptive purposes are excluded from the scope of Article 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Directive because they do not affect any of the interests which that provision aims to protect , and do not therefore fall within the concept of use within the meaning of that provision ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	112	-LRB- emphasis added -RRB- Plainly , section 10 of the 1994 Act is capable of being so construed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	113	In accordance with the Marleasing principle -LRB- Marleasing -LSB- 1990 -RSB- ECR I-4135 -RRB- , it should therefore be so construed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	114	Non-trade mark use is not within section 10 -LRB- 1 -RRB- to -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	115	Section 92 and Mr Johnstone 's conviction 18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	116	Part II of the 1994 Act relates to Community trade marks and international matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	117	Community trade marks were brought into effect by EEC Council Regulation 40/94 , which is directly applicable to this country without the need for legislation by Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	118	Part II of the Act makes provision for consequential provisions and other matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	119	Part III of the Act , from section 62 to section 97 , contains administrative and supplemental provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	120	Tucked away towards the end of these provisions are four sections which create criminal offences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	121	The material section for the purposes of this appeal is section 92 , bearing the heading ` Unauthorised use of trade mark , & c in relation to goods ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	122	Section 92 -LRB- 1 -RRB- provides : ' -LRB- 1 -RRB- A person commits an offence who with a view to gain for himself or another , or with intent to cause loss to another , and without the consent of the proprietor - -LRB- a -RRB- applies to goods or their packaging a sign identical to , or likely to be mistaken for , a registered trade mark , or -LRB- b -RRB- sells or lets for hire , offers or exposes for sale or hire or distributes goods which bear , or the packaging of which bears , such a sign , or -LRB- c -RRB- has in his possession , custody or control in the course of a business any such goods with a view to the doing of anything , by himself or another , which would be an offence under paragraph -LRB- b -RRB- . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	123	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	124	Section 92 -LRB- 2 -RRB- creates a comparable offence relating to material intended to be used for labelling or packaging goods , or as a business paper in relation to goods , or for advertising goods . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	125	Section 92 -LRB- 3 -RRB- creates a comparable offence relating to making or possessing what can loosely be described as printer 's plates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	126	The opening rubric of section 92 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and -LRB- 3 -RRB- is the same as in section 92 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	127	The activities must be done with a view to gain or with intent to cause loss and , in either case , without the consent of the proprietor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	128	Section 92 -LRB- 4 -RRB- prescribes two limiting conditions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	129	No offence is committed under the section unless one or other of these conditions is satisfied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	130	I need mention only condition -LRB- a -RRB- : that the goods are goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	131	Section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- provides a defence of reasonable belief of non-infringement : ' -LRB- 5 -RRB- It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under this section to show that he believed on reasonable grounds that the use of the sign in the manner in which it was used , or was to be used , was not an infringement of the registered trade mark .

53	132	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	133	I can now return to the narrative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	134	Mr Johnstone was arraigned at the Crown Court at Kingston on an indictment containing twelve specimen counts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	135	Each count related to one compact disc . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	136	In each count the offence comprised the false application or use of trade marks , contrary to section 92 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- of the 1994 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	137	The particulars of offence under count 1 read as follows : ` Robert Alexander JOHNSTONE on or before the 24th day of October 1997 with a view to gain for himself or another or with intent to cause loss to another and without the lawful consent of the proprietor had in his possession , custody or control in the course of a business , a compact disc entitled `` The B Sides Collection - Volumes One and Two '' bearing the trademark Bon Jovi , with a view to the commission of an act by himself or another which would be an offence under Section 92 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- of the Trade Marks Act 1994 .

53	139	At trial on 25 October 1999 Mr Lane QC submitted on behalf of Mr Johnstone that before the Crown could establish an offence under section 92 the Crown must prove a civil infringement of the registered trade mark in question , in accordance with the provisions of sections 9 to 11 of the 1994 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	140	The defence wished to rely on section 11 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- and contend that the use of the performer 's name on each of the CDs was not as an indication of trade origin . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	141	It was merely to indicate who was the performer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	142	Alternatively , Mr Johnstone wished to rely on the honest and reasonable belief defence under section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	143	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	144	Judge Mitchell , in a preliminary ruling , rejected these submissions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	145	In doing so he followed several other decisions in the Crown Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	146	Section 92 was a ` stand alone ' provision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	147	It was a complete code so far as criminal offences were concerned , and it was not necessary to prove a civil infringement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	148	` Infringement ' in section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- meant unauthorised use as defined in the earlier provisions of the section . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	149	Mr Johnstone then pleaded guilty to the offences with which he was charged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	150	He was subsequently sentenced to six months ' imprisonment concurrent on each count . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	151	A confiscation order in the amount of # 130,181.24 was made , together with forfeiture orders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	152	The Court of Appeal 23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	153	Mr Johnstone appealed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	154	On 31 January 2002 the Court of Appeal -LRB- Criminal Division -RRB- , comprising Tuckey LJ and Pumfrey and Burton JJ , allowed the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	155	In disagreeing with the judge , the court considered that unless the defences available to a claim for civil infringement of a trade mark were available in criminal proceedings section 92 would embrace behaviour which could not be the subject of a successful civil claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	156	This is not what Parliament intended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	157	Section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- presupposes that the illegal unauthorised use amounts to infringement as defined in sections 9 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- and 10 : see the definition in section 104 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	158	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	159	The Court of Appeal said that to establish an offence under section 92 -LRB- 1 -RRB- the prosecution need not prove the defendant 's conduct constituted a civil infringement unless the defence raises a defence under sections 10 to 12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	160	Then it will be for the prosecution to disprove such a defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	161	The court allowed Mr Johnstone 's appeal because the judge 's ruling had denied him the opportunity to have his defence under section 11 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- considered by the jury . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	162	The court did not order a re-trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	163	Mr Johnstone had served his sentence of imprisonment , and the alleged offences occurred 4 1/2 years ago . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	164	Section 92 and use as a trade mark 25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	165	The certified question on this appeal to your Lordships ' House is whether it is a defence to a criminal charge under section 92 of the 1994 Act that the defendant 's acts do not amount to a civil infringement of the trade mark . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	166	On this , although he substantially modified his stance in the course of his reply , Mr Perry 's opening submissions to the House were to the following effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	167	The 1994 Act provides for two separate regimes for the protection of trade marks and consumers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	168	One regime is concerned with civil infringement , the other with criminal unauthorised use of trade marks in relation to goods . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	169	As a matter of construction section 92 does not require proof of civil infringement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	170	In keeping with other offence-creating provisions , the ingredients of the offences created by section 92 appear on the face of the section . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	171	Parliament intended to create offences which would be simple for local weights and measures authorities to enforce and for magistrates and jurors to understand . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	172	Parliament did not intend to introduce questions of civil infringement into the criminal courts , save to the limited extent that an accused 's belief he was not infringing a registered trade mark might amount to a defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	173	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	174	I agree that the ingredients of the offences created by section 92 are to be found within the section itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	175	Where I part company with Mr Perry 's opening submissions is on the interpretation of section 92 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	176	Section 92 is concerned to prohibit the wrongful exploitation of registered trade marks . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	177	It replaced section 58A of the Trade Marks Act 1938 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	178	Section 58A made the fraudulent use of a trade mark an offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	179	Difficulties arose in practice in proving the necessary intent in cases where at point of sale the trader disclaimed the authenticity of his goods . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	180	The trader would describe his counterfeit products as ` brand copies ' or ` genuine fakes ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	181	Section 92 avoids this problem . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	182	In particular , intention to infringe a registered trade mark is not an ingredient of the offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	183	Instead , section 92 focuses simply on unauthorised use of ' a sign identical to , or likely to be mistaken for , a registered trade mark ' : section 92 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- , -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- and -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	184	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	185	In my view it is implicit in these provisions that the offending use of the sign must be use as a trade mark . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	186	Take , as an illustration , section 92 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	187	This prohibits the application to goods of a sign identical to , or likely to be mistaken for , a registered trade mark . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	188	Apply this to a case where the registered trade mark consists of words capable of being used descriptively . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	189	Use of these words in their descriptive sense would be , in terms of trade mark law , unobjectionable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	190	The registration of the word ` Alabaster ' as a trade mark would not preclude others from lawfully stating that their product was ` made from alabaster ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	191	Section 92 can not have been intended to criminalise such conduct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	192	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	193	This is my starting point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	194	Within the section there are two clear indications confirming this interpretation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	195	First , a prescribed ingredient of each offence is that the conduct in question is done ` without the consent of the proprietor ' of the registered trade mark . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	196	This assumes the proprietor could object to the acts in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	197	Without his consent the acts could not lawfully be done . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	198	The section is aimed at criminalising conduct of this character , namely , conduct to which the proprietor could object . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	199	This is as one would expect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	200	Parliament can not have intended to criminalise conduct which could lawfully be done without the proprietor 's consent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	201	Parliament can not have intended to make it an offence to use a sign in a way which is innocuous because it does not infringe the proprietor 's rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	202	That would be to extend , by means of a criminal sanction , the scope of the rights of the proprietor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	203	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	204	Secondly , section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- presupposes that the conduct of the person charged was an infringement of a registered trade mark . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	205	It would make no sense for reasonable belief in non-infringement to provide a defence if infringement was irrelevant so far as the criminal offences are concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	206	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	207	Further , and looking more widely , the 1994 Act as a whole must be interpreted so far as possible to give effect to the trade mark directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	208	This obligation applies to provisions such as section 92 , whose terms do not derive from the trade mark directive , as it does to provisions , such as section 10 , which derive directly from the directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	209	Articles 5 to 7 of the directive embody a ` complete harmonisation ' of the rules relating to the rights conferred by a trade mark : see Silhouette International Schmied GmbH & Co KG v Hartlauer Handelsgesellschaft mbH -LSB- 1998 -RSB- FSR 729 , 735 , para 25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	210	They define the rights of trade mark proprietors in the Community : see Zino Davidoff SA v A & G Imports Ltd -LSB- 2001 -RSB- ECR I-8691 , para 39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	211	If section 92 were to be interpreted as applying in circumstances beyond those within sections 9 to 11 , there might well be inconsistency with the trade mark directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	212	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	213	For these reasons section 92 is to be interpreted as applying only when the offending sign is used as an indication of trade origin . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	214	This is one of the ingredients of each of the offences created by section 92 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	215	It must therefore be proved by the prosecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	216	Whether a sign is so used is a question of fact in each case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	217	The test is how the use of the sign would be perceived by the average consumer of the type of goods in question : see Sabel BV v Puma AG , Rudolf Dassler Sport -LSB- 1997 -RSB- ECR I-6191 ,6224 , para 23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	218	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	219	This should not give rise to practical difficulties for weights and measures authorities or for magistrates or jurors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	220	Despite Mr Perry 's submissions , I see no reason to doubt that all those concerned are well able to grasp and apply the notion of a sign being used as an indication of trade origin as distinct , for instance , from a sign comprising words being used descriptively . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	221	In the overwhelming majority of cases there should be little difficulty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	222	Ironically , the present case is not so straightforward . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	223	I shall mention later why this is so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	224	It will be seen , therefore , that I have reached much the same conclusion as the Court of Appeal although by a more confined process of interpretation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	225	On the interpretation of section 92 which commends itself to me the pieces of this little jigsaw , some home-grown , such as section 92 , and others imported from the trade marks directive , although not fitting perfectly , fit together tolerably well . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	226	In particular , on this interpretation the circumstances in which criminal liability arises are for the most part either the same as , or narrower than , the circumstances in which civil liability arises under sections 9 to 11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	227	This is as one would expect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	228	Consistently with this , the section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- defence can operate according to its tenor , with infringement bearing the meaning defined in section 104 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	229	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	230	I should mention one possible exception . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	231	Civil liability under section 10 -LRB- 1 -RRB- to -LRB- 3 -RRB- arises only in respect of use of a sign ` in the course of trade ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	232	The equivalent phrase ` in the course of a business ' appears in section 92 in respect of some , but not all , of the alternative sets of factual ingredients of the offences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	233	For instance , this equivalent phrase appears in section 92 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- and -LRB- c -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	234	But it is not stated as a necessary ingredient in , for example , section 92 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- or -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	235	I doubt whether this dissonance between section 10 -LRB- 1 -RRB- to -LRB- 3 -RRB- and section 92 -LRB- 1 -RRB- to -LRB- 3 -RRB- is of practical importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	236	An essential ingredient of all the criminal offences created by section 92 -LRB- 1 -RRB- to -LRB- 3 -RRB- is that a person commits an offence where ` with a view to gain for himself or another , or with intent to cause loss to another ' he does the act in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	237	With this in mind it is hard to think of a realistic example of conduct which would attract criminal liability and yet be excluded from civil liability because it would not be ` in the course of trade ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	238	A question of fact 35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	239	I turn to apply section 92 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- c -RRB- to the facts of the present case , taking count 1 for ease of reference . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	240	` Bon Jovi ' is , it seems , registered as a trade mark for compact discs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	241	Clearly Mr Johnstone would commit an offence under section 92 -LRB- 1 -RRB- if he sold compact discs under the brand name ` Bon Jovi ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	242	Used in this way the sign ` Bon Jovi ' would be an indication of trade origin , in the same way as household names such as EMI or Sony are used to indicate the trade origin of compact discs marketed under those brand names . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	243	This use of the sign ` Bon Jovi ' would be as an indication that the discs themselves all came from a source known as ` Bon Jovi ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	244	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	245	That is not what Mr Johnstone did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	246	What he did was to include on the CD labels and , I assume , the accompanying packaging , the name of the group or artist whose performance was recorded on the CD in question : Bon Jovi in the case of count 1 , U2 in the case of count 2 , Rolling Stones in the case of count 3 , and so on . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	247	Considered as a matter of principle , the position in this type of case is as follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	248	If the name of the artist or group affixed to the compact disc and displayed on the packaging is exclusively an indication of the name of the performer whose performance is recorded on the compact disc , and if this use of the name of the performer is not likely to be understood as indicating any other connection between the performer and the compact disc , then such use would be descriptive only . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	249	By identifying the performer it would be descriptive of the contents of the disc and nothing more . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	250	It would not be an indication of the trade ` origin ' of the disc itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	251	Whether particular labelling and packaging satisfy this test , and consequently are innocuous for trade mark purposes , is a question of fact in each case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	252	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	253	On this question of fact different minds may sometimes reach different conclusions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	254	This is illustrated by the decision of the Federal Court of Australia , sitting as a Full Court , in Musidor BV v Tansing -LRB- t/as Apple Music House -RRB- -LRB- 1994 -RRB- 123 ALR 593 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	255	Tansing manufactured and sold compact discs bearing bootleg recordings of live performances by the Rolling Stones group in the 1960s . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	256	The packaging bore a photograph of the Rolling Stones and the name Rolling Stones in prominent lettering . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	257	The compact discs also bore the name Rolling Stones . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	258	` Rolling Stones ' was registered as a trade mark for compact discs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	259	The majority of the court , comprising Gummow and Heerey JJ , held that this use did not infringe the trade mark because it was not use as a trade mark . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	260	Use of the words ` Rolling Stones ' on the packaging and discs would convey to the prospective purchaser that if he bought the disc and played it there would emerge music of the well known group Rolling Stones . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	261	There is no other way of readily identifying the group whose performance was recorded on the disc . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	262	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	263	In his dissenting judgment Davies J reached a different conclusion on how this use of the words Rolling Stones would be understood . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	264	He expressed himself in quite general terms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	265	If a trade mark is used in relation to sound recordings , and the name is that of a musical group , ` the use of the mark will ordinarily inform the public that the article is a recording of a performance by the group and that its release has been authorised by them or their organisation ' -LSB- my emphasis -RSB- : see p 594 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	266	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	267	In the present case the Court of Appeal preferred the minority opinion of Davies J , while emphasising that whether a mark is used as a trade mark is a question of fact in every case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	268	I do not understand the Court of Appeal to have been saying that the test applicable when deciding this question of fact is different from what I have set out above . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	269	If they were , I respectfully disagree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	270	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	271	The crucial issue here , as I have said , is one of fact . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	272	I add a general comment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	273	Difficulties can be expected to arise if trade mark law is utilised as a means of enforcing performers ' rights in respect of recordings of their performances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	274	Trade mark law , as already emphasised , is concerned essentially with the trade origin of goods . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	275	Protection for the rights of performers as such is properly found elsewhere : nowadays , in Part II of the Copyright , Designs and Patents Act 1988 , as amended by the Duration of Copyright and Rights in Performers Regulations 1995 -LRB- SI 1995 no 3297 -RRB- , the Copyright and Related Rights Regulations 1996 -LRB- SI 1996 no 2967 -RRB- and the Copyright , etc. and Trade Marks -LRB- Offences and Enforcement -RRB- Act 2002 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	276	This legislation contains an elaborate code concerning the rights of performers , together with remedies and criminal sanctions for infringements of performers ' rights by making , possessing or selling illicit recordings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	277	The code includes like provision for persons having recording rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	278	I recognise that , given the control performers have over recordings of their performances , a buyer of a compact disc may expect the recording has been approved by or on behalf of the performer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	279	But that expectation , where it exists , is not necessarily indicative that the performer 's name is being used on the compact disc as a trade mark or that the average buyer so understands . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	280	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	281	For completeness I add that the decision of the European Court in Arsenal Football Club plc v Reed -LSB- 2003 -RSB- RPC 144 , already mentioned , does not assist either way on this point in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	282	There the defendant sold football club souvenirs and memorabilia , including scarves bearing the name ` Arsenal ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	283	The plaintiff football club had registered the trade mark ` Arsenal ' for classes of goods which included scarves . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	284	The club claimed the defendant 's activities infringed its registered trade marks . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	285	Having stated the applicable legal principles as quoted above , the European Court expressed its view on the facts of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	286	Use of the Arsenal logo was not intended for purely descriptive purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	287	The use was such as to create the impression ` that there is a material link in the course of trade between the goods concerned and the trade mark proprietor ' : see para 56 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	288	Whether it was open to the European Court to reach this factual conclusion has proved controversial : see -LSB- 2002 -RSB- All E R -LRB- D -RRB- 180 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	289	The rights and wrongs of this particular controversy are not material to the outcome of the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	290	The reasonable belief defence : section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- 42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	291	Mr Johnstone 's alternative defence was based on section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	292	His case was that he relied upon advice given by a reputable trade marks attorney that possession of the goods in question was lawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	293	Two points arise here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	294	The first concerns the availability of the section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- defence where the defendant does not know of the existence of the registered trade mark in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	295	In Torbay Council v Satnam Singh -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 2 Cr App R 451 the Divisional Court of the Queen 's Bench Division held that the defence was not available in such a case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	296	The court noted that section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- speaks of a reasonable belief that the ` manner ' of use of the sign did not infringe ` the registered trade mark ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	297	Auld LJ held that this presupposes an awareness by the defendant of the existence of the registration against which he can match his manner of use of the allegedly infringing sign . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	298	The Court of Appeal followed this interpretation in R v Keane -LSB- 2001 -RSB- FSR 63 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	299	More recently , a differently constituted Court of Appeal , comprising Kay LJ and Andrew Smith J , doubted the correctness of this interpretation : see R v Rhodes -LSB- 2002 -RSB- EWCA 1390 , -LSB- 2003 -RSB- FSR 147 , 153 , paras 21 and 22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	300	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	301	I share these doubts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	302	The interpretation adopted in the Satnam Singh case draws a distinction Parliament can not have intended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	303	The language of the subsection gives no support to this distinction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	304	Section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- is concerned to provide a defence where the person charged has a reasonable belief in the lawfulness of what he did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	305	Those who act honestly and reasonably are not to be visited with criminal sanctions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	306	It makes no sense to confine this defence to cases where the defendant is aware of the existence of the registered trade mark and exclude altogether those cases where the defendant is not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	307	Section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- provides a defence where the defendant believes on reasonable grounds his use of the sign does not infringe a registered trade mark of whose existence he is aware . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	308	It would be extraordinary if the subsection does not equally furnish a defence in the stronger case where the reason why the defendant believes his use of the sign does not infringe a registered trade mark is that he reasonably believes no relevant trade mark is registered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	309	Section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- is to be interpreted as including the latter case as well as the former . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	310	Burden of proof 44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	311	The opening words of section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- are that it ` is a defence for a person charged with an offence under this section to show that he believed ... ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	312	This wording gives rise to the second point arising in respect of the section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	313	It concerns the burden of proof . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	314	On this there are conflicting decisions of the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	315	In the present case the Court of Appeal held that , having regard to the presumption of innocence in article 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the European Convention on Human Rights , the burden cast upon the accused is what is often called an evidentiary burden . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	316	He must raise an issue sufficient to require the prosecution to disprove it as part of the burden of proof resting on the prosecution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	317	If the accused raises such an issue , and the prosecution fails to disprove the facts raised by the issue , the defence succeeds . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	318	It is not necessary for the accused person himself to prove the facts set out in section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	319	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	320	In the present case the prosecution did not argue the contrary view in the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	321	In the later case of R v S -LRB- Trade mark defence -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- EWCA Crim 2558 the prosecution took a different line . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	322	There the point was not conceded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	323	After what was clearly a much fuller citation of authority and examination of the issue , the Court of Appeal , comprising Rose LJ and Hughes and Davis JJ , reached the contrary conclusion on the proper interpretation of section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	324	Before your Lordships ' House the prosecution submitted that the decision of the Court of Appeal in the present case was wrong and the views expressed in R v S -LRB- Trade mark defence -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- EWCA Crim 2558 were to be preferred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	325	46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	326	In the events which have happened this issue does not call for decision in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	327	But the House should not leave the law on this point in its present state , with differing views expressed by the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	328	I shall , therefore , state my views as shortly as may be . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	329	First , I entertain no doubt that , unless this interpretation is incompatible with article 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Convention , section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- should be interpreted as imposing on the accused person the burden of proving the relevant facts on the balance of probability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	330	Unless he proves these facts he does not make good the defence provided by section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	331	The contrary interpretation of section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- involves substantial re-writing of the subsection . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	332	It would not be sufficient to read the subsection as meaning that it is a defence for a person charged to raise an issue on the facts in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	333	That would not be sufficient , because raising an issue does not provide the person charged with a defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	334	It provides him with a defence only if , he having raised an issue , the prosecution then fails to disprove the relevant facts beyond reasonable doubt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	335	I do not believe section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- can be so read . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	336	I do not believe that is what Parliament intended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	337	47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	338	The question which next arises is whether this interpretation , namely , that section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- imposes a ` legal ' or ` persuasive ' onus on the person charged , is compatible with the presumption of innocence contained in article 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the European Convention on Human Rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	339	Prima facie this interpretation derogates from that principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	340	That much is clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	341	On this interpretation section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- sets out facts a defendant must establish if he is to avoid conviction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	342	These facts are presumed against him unless he establishes the contrary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	343	48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	344	That is not the end of the matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	345	The European Court of Human Rights has recognised that the Convention does not , in principle , prohibit presumptions of fact or law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	346	What article 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- requires is that they must be confined within reasonable limits which take into account the importance of what is at stake and maintain the rights of the defence : Salabiaku v France -LRB- 1988 -RRB- 13 EHRR 379 , 388 , para 28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	347	Thus , as elsewhere in the Convention , a reasonable balance has to be held between the public interest and the interests of the individual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	348	In each case it is for the state to show that the balance held in the legislation is reasonable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	349	The derogation from the presumption of innocence requires justification . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	350	49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	351	Identifying the requirements of a reasonable balance is not as easy as might seem . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	352	One is seeking to balance incommensurables . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	353	At the heart of the difficulty is the paradox noted by Sachs J in State v Coetzee -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 2 LRC 593 , 677 , para 220 : the more serious the crime and the greater the public interest in securing convictions of the guilty , the more important the constitutional protection of the accused becomes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	354	In the face of this paradox all that can be said is that for a reverse burden of proof to be acceptable there must be a compelling reason why it is fair and reasonable to deny the accused person the protection normally guaranteed to everyone by the presumption of innocence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	355	50 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	356	The relevant factors to be take into account when considering whether such a reason exists have been considered in several recent authorities , in particular the decisions of the House in R v Director of Public Prosecutions , ex parte Kebilene -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 2 AC 326 and R v Lambert -LSB- 2001 -RSB- UKHL 37 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 AC 545 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	357	And there is now a lengthening list of decisions of the Court of Appeal and other courts in respect of particular statutory provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	358	A sound starting point is to remember that if an accused is required to prove a fact on the balance of probability to avoid conviction , this permits a conviction in spite of the fact-finding tribunal having a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused : see Dickson CJ in R v Whyte -LRB- 1988 -RRB- 51 DLR -LRB- 4th -RRB- 481 , 493 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	359	This consequence of a reverse burden of proof should colour one 's approach when evaluating the reasons why it is said that , in the absence of a persuasive burden on the accused , the public interest will be prejudiced to an extent which justifies placing a persuasive burden on the accused . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	360	The more serious the punishment which may flow from conviction , the more compelling must be the reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	361	The extent and nature of the factual matters required to be proved by the accused , and their importance relative to the matters required to be proved by the prosecution , have to be taken into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	362	So also does the extent to which the burden on the accused relates to facts which , if they exist , are readily provable by him as matters within his own knowledge or to which he has ready access . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	363	51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	364	In evaluating these factors the court 's role is one of review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	365	Parliament , not the court , is charged with the primary responsibility for deciding , as a matter of policy , what should be the constituent elements of a criminal offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	366	I echo the words of Lord Woolf in Attorney-General of Hong Kong v Lee Kwong-kut -LSB- 1993 -RSB- AC 951 , 975 : ` In order to maintain the balance between the individual and the society as a whole , rigid and inflexible standards should not be imposed on the legislature 's attempts to resolve the difficult and intransigent problems with which society is faced when seeking to deal with serious crime . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	367	The court will reach a different conclusion from the legislature only when it is apparent the legislature has attached insufficient importance to the fundamental right of an individual to be presumed innocent until proved guilty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	368	52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	369	I turn to section 92 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	370	-LRB- 1 -RRB- Counterfeiting is fraudulent trading . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	371	It is a serious contemporary problem . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	372	Counterfeiting has adverse economic effects on genuine trade . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	373	It also has adverse effects on consumers , in terms of quality of goods and , sometimes , on the health or safety of consumers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	374	The Commission of the European Communities has noted the scale of this ` widespread phenomenon with a global impact ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	375	Urgent steps are needed to combat counterfeiting and piracy : see the Green Paper , Combating Counterfeiting and Piracy in the Single Market , COM -LRB- 98 -RRB- 569 final , and its follow up , COM -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 789 final . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	376	Protection of consumers and honest manufacturers and traders from counterfeiting is an important policy consideration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	377	-LRB- 2 -RRB- The offences created by section 92 have rightly been described as offences of ` near absolute liability ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	378	The prosecution is not required to prove intent to infringe a registered trade mark . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	379	-LRB- 3 -RRB- The offences attract a serious level of punishment : a maximum penalty on indictment of an unlimited fine or imprisonment for up to ten years or both , together with the possibility of confiscation and deprivation orders . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	380	-LRB- 4 -RRB- Those who trade in brand products are aware of the need to be on guard against counterfeit goods . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	381	They are aware of the need to deal with reputable suppliers and keep records and of the risks they take if they do not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	382	-LRB- 5 -RRB- The section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- defence relates to facts within the accused person 's own knowledge : his state of mind , and the reasons why he held the belief in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	383	His sources of supply are known to him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	384	-LRB- 6 -RRB- Conversely , by and large it is to be expected that those who supply traders with counterfeit products , if traceable at all by outside investigators , are unlikely to be co-operative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	385	So , in practice , if the prosecution must prove that a trader acted dishonestly , fewer investigations will be undertaken and fewer prosecutions will take place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	386	53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	387	In my view factors -LRB- 4 -RRB- and -LRB- 6 -RRB- constitute compelling reasons why the section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- defence should place a persuasive burden on the accused person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	388	Taking all the factors mentioned above into account , these reasons justify the loss of protection which will be suffered by the individual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	389	Given the importance and difficulty of combating counterfeiting , and given the comparative ease with which an accused can raise an issue about his honesty , overall it is fair and reasonable to require a trader , should need arise , to prove on the balance of probability that he honestly and reasonably believed the goods were genuine . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	390	54 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	391	For these reasons , which are substantially the same as those given by Rose LJ in R v S -LRB- Trade mark defence -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- EWCA Crim 2558 , I consider the persuasive burden placed on an accused person by the section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- defence is compatible with article 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	392	This being so , it becomes unnecessary to consider whether , if this interpretation of section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- were incompatible with article 6 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- might be open to a different interpretation pursuant to section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Human Rights Act 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker

53	394	I would dismiss this appeal . 	lord nicholls	self	outcome	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	395	The answer to the certified question is that use of the offending sign as an indication of trade origin is an ingredient of the offences created by section 92 of the 1994 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord nicholls, lord walker

NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	420	Counterfeiting , piracy and bootlegging are not exact terms but all involve deliberate , and generally fraudulent , infringement of various intellectual property rights -- notably trade marks , copyright , design right and performing rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	421	Counterfeiting is generally used to include unauthorised sale , under a well-known trade mark , of goods not made or authorised by the proprietor of the trade mark . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	422	Piracy is generally used to include infringement of copyright -LRB- including copyright in computer software -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	423	Bootlegging is generally used to describe the sale of sound recordings made , without authority , either at live concerts or from broadcasts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	424	Typically , bootleg sound recordings are sold under a manufacturer 's name which is unobjectionable but with unauthorised use , on the compact disc and its packaging , of the name of the performers -LRB- for instance , the Rolling Stones -RRB- despite the fact that their name may be a registered trade mark .

53	426	The international community has a strong interest in suppressing these dishonest activities by both civil and criminal sanctions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	427	This case is concerned with this country 's criminal sanctions against misuse of trade marks used in the popular music industry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	428	Your Lordships have in a sense been looking at only a small part of the total picture of sanctions against these activities , since your Lordships have not been concerned with civil or criminal sanctions against copyright infringements , or with the far-reaching civil and criminal sanctions provided under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 and the Consumer Protection Act 1987 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker

53	430	Section 92 of the Trade Marks Act 1994 -LRB- `` the 1994 Act '' -RRB- creates a number of criminal offences punishable -LRB- on conviction on indictment -RRB- by up to ten years ' imprisonment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	431	The principal issue raised on this appeal is whether a person can be convicted of an offence under section 92 for acts which do not amount to a civil infringement of a registered trade mark . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	432	There are also some subsidiary and related issues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	433	In order to explain how they arise it is necessary to say something about the background to the 1994 Act and its legislative scheme and purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	434	62 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	435	The law of trade marks has ancient origins which are preserved in the non-statutory law of passing off . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	436	Statutory regulation of trade marks , including a system of registration , was introduced by the Trade Marks Act 1875 and the Trade Marks Registration Act 1875 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	437	For much of the 20th century the operative statute was the Trade Marks Act 1938 -LRB- `` the 1938 Act '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	438	In recent times the whole of trade mark law has been re-shaped by the 1994 Act , which was enacted -LRB- as its long title states -RRB- , `` to make new provision for registered trade marks , implementing Council Directive No. 89/104/EEC of 21 December 1988 -LSB- ` the Directive ' -RSB- to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks ; to make provision in connection with Council Regulation -LRB- EC -RRB- No 40/94 of 20 December 1993 on the Community trade mark ; to give effect to the Madrid Protocol Relating to the International Registration of Marks of 27 June 1989 , and to certain provisions of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property of 20 March 1883 , as revised and amended ; and for connected purposes '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	439	63 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	440	In construing the 1994 Act your Lordships have to approach it as a new statute , the main purpose of which is to implement the Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	441	The Directive aims at the partial approximation -LRB- but not the complete harmonisation -RRB- of the trade mark laws of the member states . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	442	The 1994 Act must be construed accordingly -LRB- see Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentación SA -LSB- 1990 -RSB- ECR I - 4135 , para 8 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	443	But many of the basic concepts in the Directive appear to be the same as , or closely similar to , those which have informed the previous domestic law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	444	That is natural enough , since the basic purpose of a trade mark is the same in any national economic system . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	445	The purpose is as a guarantee of commercial origin . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	446	As it was recently put by the European Court of Justice in Philips Electronics NV v Remington Consumer Products Limited -LSB- 2003 -RSB- RPC 14 , 22 , para 30 , `` according to the case-law of the Court , the essential function of a trade mark is to guarantee the identity of the origin of the marked product to the consumer or end-user by enabling him , without any possibility of confusion , to distinguish the product or service from others which have another origin , and for the trade mark to be able to fulfil its essential role in the system of undistorted competition which the Treaty seeks to establish , it must offer a guarantee that all the goods or services bearing it have originated under the control of a single undertaking which is responsible for their quality '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	447	64 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	448	In order to fulfil this function , a trade mark must be distinctive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	449	That has always been a requirement under English law -LRB- although under the 1938 Act two levels of distinctiveness were required for so-called Part A and Part B registrations , a complication which has now disappeared -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	450	Distinctiveness is in this context to be contrasted with descriptiveness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	451	Words which would be absurdly inappropriate as a description -LRB- such as North Pole for bananas : see British Sugar plc v James Robertson & Sons Limited -LSB- 1996 -RSB- RPC 281 , 306 -RRB- may for precisely that reason be particularly distinctive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	452	The contrast is closely connected with the issue of trade mark use -LRB- that is , use of a registered trade mark for its statutory purpose , rather than for some other purpose -RRB- to which it will be necessary to return . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	453	65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	454	Section 92 must be set in its context of the general scheme of the 1994 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	455	Its scheme is that Part I -LRB- sections 1-50 -RRB- deals with registered trade marks . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	456	Part II -LRB- sections 51-60 -RRB- deals with Community trade marks and international matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	457	Part III -LRB- sections 62-98 -RRB- contains administrative and other supplementary provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	458	Part IV -LRB- sections 99-110 -RRB- contains miscellaneous and general provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	459	For present purposes the most important sections in Part I are sections 1-3 and 9-12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	460	Section 1 defines `` trade mark '' as `` any sign capable of being represented graphically which is capable of distinguishing goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	461	Section 2 provides that a registered trade mark is a property right which gives the proprietor rights and remedies under the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	462	Section 3 lists absolute grounds for refusal of registration , including -LRB- in sub-section -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- , '' -LRB- b -RRB- trade marks which are devoid of any distinctive character ; -LRB- c -RRB- trade marks which consist exclusively of signs or indications which may serve , in trade , to designate the kind , quality , quantity , intended purpose , value , geographical origin , the time of production of goods or of rendering of services , or other characteristics of goods or services '' The general effect of paragraph -LRB- c -RRB- is to indicate that a proposed trade mark may not perform a purely descriptive function , and its language is echoed by that of section 11 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	463	66 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	464	Section 9 -LRB- 1 -RRB- provides , `` The proprietor of a registered trade mark has exclusive rights in the trade mark which are infringed by use of the trade mark in the United Kingdom without his consent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	465	The acts amounting to infringement , if done without the consent of the proprietor , are specified in section 10 '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	466	So what amounts to an infringement -LRB- sometimes referred to in the course of argument in the appeal as civil infringement -RRB- is to be gathered from section 10 , as supplemented by sections 11 and 12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	467	These sections are something of an intricate mosaic -LRB- no doubt reflecting the difficulties facing the draftsman in amalgamating the old law under the 1938 Act with the Directive , and in particular Articles 5 and 6 of the Directive -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	468	67 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	469	The text of sections 10 and 11 is set out either verbatim or in detailed summary in the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead , which I have had the advantage of reading in draft -LRB- and from which I also gratefully adopt the summary of the facts -RRB- . 	lord walker	lord nicholls	ackn	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	469	The text of sections 10 and 11 is set out either verbatim or in detailed summary in the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead , which I have had the advantage of reading in draft -LRB- and from which I also gratefully adopt the summary of the facts -RRB- . 	lord walker	lord nicholls	factagr	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	470	I will merely repeat the general effect of sections 10 and 11 -LRB- section 12 deals with exhaustion of rights and is not relevant to this appeal -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	471	-LRB- 1 -RRB- Infringement occurs only if there is unauthorised use in the course of trade -LRB- defined in section 103 as including any business or profession -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	472	-LRB- 2 -RRB- If use is of the same mark for the same goods -LRB- referred to in argument as double identity -RRB- liability is -LRB- subject to the question of trademark use -RRB- automatic : section 10 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , reflecting Article 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	473	-LRB- 3 -RRB- If the allegedly infringing use is a case of identity of mark -LRB- only -RRB- or of goods -LRB- only -RRB- with mere similarity in the other element , liability is not automatic but depends on likelihood of confusion : section 10 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , reflecting Article 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	474	-LRB- 4 -RRB- If the mark used is the same or similar , but the goods are not similar , there is liability if the trademark has a reputation in the United Kingdom , and the alleged infringement takes unfair advantage of , or is detrimental to , the distinctive character or the repute of the trademark : section 10 -LRB- 3 -RRB- , reflecting the permissive provision in Article 5 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- which has recently been given a liberal interpretation by the European Court of Justice in Davidoff & Cie SA v Gofkid Limited 9 January 2003 , paras . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	475	17-30 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	476	-LRB- 5 -RRB- Use is defined -LRB- non-exhaustively -RRB- in section 10 -LRB- 4 -RRB- , reflecting Article 5 -LRB- 3 -RRB- ; section 10 -LRB- 5 -RRB- extends liability to accomplices ; and section 10 -LRB- 6 -RRB- covers comparative advertising -LRB- and similar special uses -RRB- provided that they are fair and honest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	477	-LRB- 6 -RRB- All these provisions are subject to the specific restrictions and exceptions in sections 11 and 12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	478	For present purposes the most important exception is in section 11 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -- `` A registered trade mark is not infringed by -- -LRB- a -RRB- the use by a person of his own name or address , -LRB- b -RRB- the use of indications concerning the kind , quality , quantity , intended purpose , value , geographical origin , the time of production of goods or of rendering of services , or other characteristics of goods or services , or -LRB- c -RRB- the use of the trademark where it is necessary to indicate the intended purpose of a product or service -LRB- in particular , as accessories or spare parts -RRB- , provided the use is in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	479	This provision reproduces , almost word for word , Article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Directive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	480	68 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	481	Section 92 , in Part III of the 1994 Act , represents the third generation of statutory provisions creating trademark offences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	482	From the earliest days it was an offence to falsify the register or falsely represent a trade mark as being registered -LRB- see now sections 94 and 95 of the 1994 Act -RRB- but those provisions are not now in point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	483	Section 58A of the 1938 Act -LRB- introduced by the Copyright , Designs and Patents Act 1988 -RRB- first made fraudulent application or use of a trade mark a criminal offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	484	Your Lordships are not concerned with the detail of section 58A but it may be noted that it had a relatively demanding test of mens rea and it proved unsatisfactory in practice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	485	69 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	486	It is necessary to set out section 92 in full : -LRB- 1 -RRB- A person commits an offence who with a view to gain for himself or another , or with intent to cause loss to another , and without the consent of the proprietor -- -LRB- a -RRB- applies to goods or their packaging a sign identical to , or likely to be mistaken for , a registered trade mark , or -LRB- b -RRB- sells or lets for hire , offers or exposes for sale or hire or distributes goods which bear , or the packaging of which bears , such a sign , or -LRB- c -RRB- has in his possession , custody or control in the course of a business any such goods with a view to the doing of anything , by himself or another , which would be an offence under paragraph -LRB- b -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	487	-LRB- 2 -RRB- A person commits an offence who with a view to gain for himself or another , or with intent to cause loss to another , and without the consent of the proprietor -- -LRB- a -RRB- applies a sign identical to , or likely to be mistaken for , a registered trade mark to material intended to be used -- -LRB- i -RRB- for labelling or packaging goods , -LRB- ii -RRB- as a business paper in relation to goods , or -LRB- iii -RRB- for advertising goods , or -LRB- b -RRB- uses in the course of a business material bearing such a sign for labelling or packaging goods , as a business paper in relation to goods , or for advertising goods , or -LRB- c -RRB- has in his possession , custody or control in the course of a business any such material with a view to the doing of anything , by himself or another , which would be an offence under paragraph -LRB- b -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	488	-LRB- 3 -RRB- A person commits an offence who with a view to gain for himself or another , or with intent to cause loss to another , and without the consent of the proprietor -- -LRB- a -RRB- makes an article specifically designed or adapted for making copies of a sign identical to , or likely to be mistaken for , a registered trade mark , or -LRB- b -RRB- has such an article in his possession , custody or control in the course of a business , knowing or having reason to believe that it has been , or is to be , used to produce goods , or material for labelling or packaging goods , as a business paper in relation to goods , or for advertising goods . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	489	-LRB- 4 -RRB- A person does not commit an offence under this section unless -- -LRB- a -RRB- the goods are goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered , or -LRB- b -RRB- the trade mark has a reputation in the United Kingdom and the use of the sign takes or would take unfair advantage of , or is or would be detrimental to , the distinctive character or the repute of the trade mark . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	490	-LRB- 5 -RRB- It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under this section to show that he believed on reasonable grounds that the use of the sign in the manner in which it was used , or was to be used , was not an infringement of the registered trade mark . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	491	-LRB- 6 -RRB- A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable -- -LRB- a -RRB- on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum , or both ; -LRB- b -RRB- on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years , or both . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	492	70 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	493	There is no special definition of `` infringement '' in section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	494	Under the index in section 104 it is to be construed in accordance with sections 9 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- and 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	495	It was not argued that that does not necessarily include sections 11 and 12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	496	71 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	497	Section 92 was enacted by Parliament in conformity with international obligations -LRB- under Article 61 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights , or `` TRIPS '' -RRB- which take effect as part of Community law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	498	Mr Hobbs QC -LRB- for the intervener , The British Phonographic Industry -RRB- gave a detailed explanation of the background but it is not necessary to go further into it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	499	72 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	500	Much of the argument before your Lordships has focused on sub-section -LRB- 5 -RRB- of section 92 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	501	It provides a defence if the accused shows that he believed on reasonable grounds that he was not infringing the registered trade mark . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	502	This very strongly suggests -LRB- but the section does not in terms state -RRB- that it must also be a defence if the accused was not actually infringing the registered trade mark under sections 9 to 11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	503	The Court of Appeal found that argument conclusive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	504	Tuckey LJ put the point strongly -LRB- para 46 -RRB- : `` Put another way , it would provide a defence when a defendant has a reasonable belief that there is no civil infringement , when in fact the absence of civil infringement would be no defence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	505	This is a nonsense '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	506	73 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	507	Both sides agreed that it is hard to find an example of conduct which would be a criminal offence under section 92 -LRB- 1 -RRB- to -LRB- 4 -RRB- , but would not amount to a civil infringement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	508	It was also common ground that if an exceptional case were to be found -LRB- such as a single sale of a limited number of articles , such as T-shirts , arguably not amounting to trading -RRB- it would in practice be most unlikely to attract prosecution under section 92 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	509	Mr Perry -LRB- for the appellant -RRB- identified six points of substantial difference between section 92 and what I will call the civil infringement sections , and it is useful to examine these . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	510	But it must be recognised at once that if the scope or `` footprint '' of section 92 is smaller than , and wholly contained within , the `` footprint '' of the civil infringement sections , it is at first blush surprising that the linguistic differences between them are so extensive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	511	Their superficial disparity must be explained , I think , by Parliament 's natural anxiety to frame the offence-creating provisions of the 1994 Act so as to be as self-contained and as simple a code as possible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	512	Prosecutions under section 92 are heard either in the Magistrates ' Court or in the Crown Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	513	It would be burdensome if lay magistrates and juries regularly had to go into the intricacies of the law of civil infringement , especially in its present state of flux following the decision of the European Court of Justice in Arsenal Football Club plc v Reed -LSB- 2003 -RSB- RPC 144 -LRB- to which I shall return -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	514	I respectfully agree with the view of Lord Nicholls that this House should so far as possible adhere to the language of section 92 , treating it as being as self-contained as possible , and avoiding any unnecessary elaboration of trade mark law as it falls to be applied in criminal courts . 	lord walker	lord nicholls	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	515	74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	516	As the arrangement and language of the two sets of provisions is so different it may be helpful to summarise Mr Perry 's six points . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	517	-LRB- 1 -RRB- Under section 92 the prosecution must prove the special mens rea of `` with a view to gain '' -LRB- including causing loss to another -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	518	There is no civil equivalent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	519	-LRB- 2 -RRB- The offence-creating provisions apply only in respect of goods -LRB- whereas the civil provisions cover goods or services -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	520	-LRB- 3 -RRB- The offence-creating provisions refer to a sign `` identical to , or likely to be mistaken for '' the registered mark . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	521	This is a simpler and narrower formulation than that in section 10 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	522	-LRB- 4 -RRB- Section 92 -LRB- 4 -RRB- combines the functions of parts of sections 10 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and -LRB- 3 -RRB- but differs in substance only if the form of words in sub-section -LRB- 4 -RRB- -LRB- `` goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered '' -RRB- is narrower than that in section 10 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- -LRB- `` identical with or similar to '' -RRB- .

53	523	-LRB- 5 -RRB- Section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- has no civil equivalent : a defendant 's belief in his innocence is irrelevant to civil liability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	524	-LRB- 6 -RRB- Criminal liability may arise from acts although they are not done in the course of trade -LRB- this is , as already noted , the only respect in which the scope of section 92 may be wider , and it seems to be of little practical importance -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	525	75 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	526	In summary , section 92 is clearly narrower on points -LRB- 1 -RRB- , -LRB- 2 -RRB- and -LRB- 5 -RRB- above ; it may be narrower -LRB- and is certainly not wider -RRB- on points -LRB- 3 -RRB- and -LRB- 4 -RRB- ; point -LRB- 6 -RRB- tends to lead to an unprofitable debate as to whether fraudulent activities should be regarded as a trade , and it is easy to see why Parliament avoided language which raised that issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	527	However Mr Perry 's points do not include the issues which lie at the heart of this appeal , that is -LRB- i -RRB- whether `` trade mark use '' is a necessary ingredient of criminal liability under section 92 ; -LRB- ii -RRB- if so , what are its proper limits ; and -LRB- iii -RRB- how it should be dealt with in practice , in terms of directions to a jury or self-direction to magistrates , in prosecutions under section 92 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	528	To those issues I now turn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	529	76 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	530	`` Trade mark use '' is a convenient shorthand expression for use of a registered trade mark for its proper purpose -LRB- that is , identifying and guaranteeing the trade origin of the goods to which it is applied -RRB- rather than for some other purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	531	It is easy to recognise those cases which fall squarely on one side or other of the line . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	532	If a counterfeiter sells a cheap imitation watch under the trade mark OMEGA , he is fraudulently engaging in trade mark use -LRB- as he is , as Mr Hobbs suggested , if he uses the mark HOMEGAS but prints the first and last letters very faintly -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	533	But if a publisher publishes a book named `` Mother Care/Other Care '' -LRB- a serious study of the upbringing of young children of working mothers -RRB- there is no infringement of the registered trade mark of Mothercare UK Limited , despite the fact that the trade mark is registered for many classes of goods , including books : see Mothercare UK Limited v Penguin Books Limited -LSB- 1988 -RSB- RPC 113 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	534	77 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	535	That was a decision of the Court of Appeal on a Part A registration under the 1938 Act , but the essential point holds good . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	536	Dillon LJ said at pages 118-9 , `` it stands to reason that a Trade Marks Act would only be concerned to restrict the use of a mark as a trademark or in a trademark sense , and should be construed accordingly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	537	If descriptive words are legitimately registered in Part A of the register , there is still no reason why other people should not be free to use the words in a descriptive sense , and not in any trademark sense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	538	Mr Aldous took the further point , on the trademark aspect of the case , that Mothercare suffers damage because the value and exclusivity of its mark is diminished , by any use by anyone else of the words ` mother care ' , but that , in my judgment , can only be so if those words are used by the offender as a trademark or in a trademark sense ; if descriptive words are merely used descriptively , the mark is unaffected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	539	In the present case the words ` Mother Care ' in the title of the book are not , in my judgment , used as a trademark or in any trademark sense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	540	They are merely used descriptively as describing , with the words ` Other Care ' what the book is about '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	541	Similarly Bingham LJ said at page 123 -LRB- of section 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- of the 1938 Act -RRB- , `` To conclude otherwise would be to hold -LRB- where a trademark consists of an English word or words -RRB- that Parliament intended to grant the proprietor of the trademark what would in effect be commercial copyright in that word or those words . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	542	Had that been the intention , the drafting of the section could have been a great deal simpler '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	543	78 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	544	In Bravado Merchandising Services Ltd v Mainstream Publishing -LRB- Edinburgh -RRB- Ltd -LSB- 1996 -RSB- FSR 205 , a comparable question arose under the 1994 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	545	The petitioner was the proprietor of the trade mark Wet Wet Wet -LRB- the name of a popular music group -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	546	It was registered for -LRB- among other classes of goods -RRB- books . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	547	The defendant intended to publish a book about the group using `` Wet Wet Wet '' as part of the title . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	548	In the Court of Session Lord McCluskey found -LRB- distinguishing Mothercare -RRB- that that would be trade mark use , but that it would nevertheless be within section 11 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- -LRB- as amounting to an indication of the characteristics of the goods to which the mark was applied -RRB- and so would not amount to an infringement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	549	So Lord McCluskey might be thought to have given with one hand and to have taken away with the other ; but that depends on whether sections 10 and 11 of the 1994 Act should be seen as contingent or intersecting circles , a point on which there was a good deal of discussion in the course of argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	550	79 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	551	Your Lordships were also referred to the decision of the Federal Court of Australia in Musidor BV v Tansing -LRB- 1994 -RRB- 123 ALR 593 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	552	The Federal Court was divided as to whether the trade mark Rolling Stones -LRB- registered in respect of compact discs as well as other goods -RRB- was infringed by bootleg discs -LRB- using recordings made at live concerts in the 1960 's -RRB- which used the words Rolling Stones on each disc and its case insert . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	553	The insert also stated that the recordings had not been authorised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	554	The majority -LRB- Gummow and Heerey JJ -RRB- concluded that this was not trade mark use -LRB- at page 605 -RRB- : '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker

53	558	Rather , they are used here to identify a recording made many years ago of a live performance by those persons in the United States , which has been reproduced and embodied in the discs manufactured by the respondent '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	559	Davies J , dissenting , thought that there had been trade mark use , and that the disclaimer of authorisation made no difference -LRB- at page 598 -RRB- : `` To exemplify the infringement , assume that ` Pierre Cardin ' and ` Gucci ' are registered trade marks and that the Pierre Cardin organisation or the Gucci organisation manufactured goods but declined to put them on sale being not satisfied with their quality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	560	It would , in my opinion , be an infringement for some other person without authority to put the goods on the market with the description that they had been manufactured by Pierre Cardin or by Gucci but that the sale had not been authorised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	561	Yet that is what the respondent seeks to do in the present case '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	562	Davies J also expressed the view that the respondent had not used the words ` Rolling Stones ' in good faith . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	563	80 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	564	Comparable problems have recently been considered by the European Court of Justice in Arsenal Football Club plc v Reed -LSB- 2003 -RSB- RPC 144 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	565	Arsenal Football Club -LRB- `` AFC '' -RRB- is the proprietor of four trade marks , including two word marks -LRB- `` Arsenal '' and `` Arsenal Gunners '' -RRB- registered for -LRB- among other goods -RRB- clothing and sports footwear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	566	Mr Reed had since 1970 been selling clothing -LRB- especially scarves -RRB- marked `` Arsenal '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	567	He displayed prominent notices disavowing `` any affiliation or relationship with the manufacturers or distributors of any other product '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	568	AFC sued him for passing off and trade mark infringement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	569	The claim in passing off failed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	570	The trade mark claim led to a reference to the European Court of Justice by the High Court -LRB- Laddie J -RRB- of the following questions : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- Where a trade mark is validly registered and -LRB- a -RRB- a third party uses in the course of trade a sign identical with that trade mark in relation to goods which are identical with those for which the trade mark is registered ; and -LRB- b -RRB- the third party has no defence to infringement by virtue of article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of -LSB- the Directive -RSB- : does the third party have a defence to infringement on the ground that the use complained of does not indicate trade origin -LRB- i.e. a connection in the course of trade between the goods and the trade mark proprietor -RRB- ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	571	-LRB- 2 -RRB- If so , is the fact that the use in question would be perceived as a badge of support , loyalty or affiliation to the trade mark proprietor a sufficient connection ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	572	81 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	573	As already noted , article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- like section 11 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -RRB- makes an exception for descriptive use , but only if it is use `` in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	574	It is not entirely clear whether the terms of the reference made by the High Court assumed that article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- provided no defence because of the need for descriptiveness , or because of the proviso as to honest practices . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	575	82 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	576	In making the reference Laddie J made what he described as findings of fact which are recorded in the judgment of the European Court of Justice -LRB- paras . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	577	21-22 -RRB- : '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker

53	580	the High Court rejected -LSB- AFC 's -RSB- argument that the use by Mr Reed of the signs registered as trade marks was perceived by those to whom they were addressed as a badge of origin , so that the use was a `` trade mark use '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	581	According to the High Court , the signs affixed to Mr Reed 's goods were in fact perceived by the public as `` badges of support , loyalty or affiliation '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker

53	586	uses for purely descriptive purposes are excluded from the scope of article 5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Directive because they do not affect any of the interests which that provision aims to protect , and do not therefore fall within the concept of use within the meaning of that provision -LRB- see , with respect to a use for purely descriptive purposes relating to the characteristics of the product offered , Case C-2 / 00 Hölterhoff -LSB- 2002 -RSB- ECR I-4187 , para . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	587	16 -RRB- '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	588	The Court distinguished Hölterhoff -LRB- where a trade mark had been used to describe a method of cutting precious stones , rather than to identify their producer -RRB- as being concerned with a transaction in the course of wholesale trade . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	589	The Court stated that Mr Reed 's use of the Arsenal sign took place in the context of sales to consumers and was obviously not intended for purely descriptive purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	590	The use was such as to create the impression that there was a material link in the course of trade between Mr Reed 's goods and AFC . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	591	AFC could therefore rely on what Mr Reed had done as trade mark use . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	592	84 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	593	Laddie J has since -LRB- 12 December 2002 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- All ER -LRB- D -RRB- 180 -RRB- held that the European Court of Justice exceeded its jurisdiction by determining issues of fact which were for the national court to decide -LRB- and which he had , as he saw it , already decided in a manner favourable to Mr Reed -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	594	An appeal to the Court of Appeal seems likely . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	595	85 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	596	The law is therefore in something of a state of disarray . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	597	But even if the European Court of Justice exceeded its jurisdiction in the Arsenal case -LRB- a point on which I would express no view -RRB- , its exposition of the general principles is still highly material . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	598	The Court has excluded use of a trade mark for `` purely descriptive purposes '' -LRB- and the word `` purely '' is important -RRB- because such use does not affect the interests which the trade mark proprietor is entitled to protect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	599	But there will be infringement if the sign is used , without authority , `` to create the impression that there is a material link in the course of trade between the goods concerned and the trade mark proprietor '' -LRB- para 56 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	600	There may be such a link , in the view of the European Court of Justice , even though the consumer treats the mark as a badge of support for or loyalty to the trade mark proprietor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	601	As Advocate-General Colomer put it in a footnote to his opinion -LRB- para . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	602	A66 , footnote 52 -RRB- , `` However much Mr Reed may announce that the goods which he sells neither come from -LSB- AFC -RSB- nor are authorised by it he is able to market them -- and his customers buy them -- precisely because they bear the signs which , under registered protection , identify the club '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	603	86 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	604	The difficulty arises , I think , because between cases which are clearly at the opposite extremes of `` distinctiveness '' and `` descriptiveness '' there is something of a no man 's land of debateable cases , and the problem of analysis varies with the character of the mark and the character of the goods to which it is affixed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	605	Disputes about books , and scarves , and compact discs , can not easily be resolved by a single test . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	606	Most people would have an intuitive feeling that to label a compact disc with the words `` Rolling Stones '' is less purely descriptive than entitling a biography `` Wet Wet Wet '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	607	That is no doubt because a group of musicians are in some sense the authors -LRB- or at least the performers -RRB- of what is on the disc , but are not the authors of an unauthorised book about themselves . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	608	But in that case is not their real grievance infringement of their copyright or their performing rights , rather than of their trade mark ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	609	Was not Mr Hölterhoff 's real complaint infringement of his design right in two new methods of cutting precious stones -LRB- if indeed he had invented those methods -RRB- rather than of his trade mark ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	610	87 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	611	These are difficult questions which it is not necessary for your Lordships to determine in order to dispose of this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	612	Whatever uncertainties there are about the decision of the European Court of Justice in Arsenal , its likely effect is that the province of trade mark use has annexed a significant part of the no man 's land in which elements of distinctiveness and descriptiveness overlap . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	613	But it would be idle to speculate whether the view taken by the European Court of Justice in the Arsenal case is reconcilable with the majority view in Musidor because -LRB- as Lord Nicholls has emphasised in his speech , and as I respectfully agree -RRB- trade mark use is essentially a question of fact -LRB- of a fairly complex sort -RRB- . 	lord walker	lord nicholls	partagr	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	614	Musidor can indeed be seen as turning on whether it was right for the Federal Court to differ from the trial judge on an issue of that sort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	615	The judgments mention some of the factors which may contribute to the eventual conclusion : the prominence and apparent purpose with which the group 's name -LRB- and registered trade mark -RRB- is used on the disc and its packaging ; what other brand marks -LRB- registered or unregistered -RRB- are used on the disc and its packaging ; the terms and prominence of any disclaimer -LRB- although a disclaimer , by itself , can not be conclusive -RRB- ; and any other matters going to the alleged infringer 's good faith and honesty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	616	88 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	617	I come back to what I described as the issues which lie at the heart of this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	618	First , is trade mark use a necessary ingredient of criminal liability under section 92 ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	619	On this point I am in respectful agreement with the reasoning and conclusions in the speech of Lord Nicholls . 	lord walker	lord nicholls	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	620	It is a necessary ingredient , and there is no need to go on a circuitous route through article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- or section 11 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- in order to arrive at that conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	621	It is adequately -LRB- if not pellucidly -RRB- expressed in the language of section 92 , which in its three offence-creating sub-sections requires the defendant , for the purpose of gain , to have applied a sign to goods -LRB- or their packaging -RRB- , or to have engaged in other acts or conduct in relation to goods -LRB- or business materials -RRB- which bear that sign . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	622	I would hold that such acts or conduct must be restricted to acts or conduct amounting to trade mark use . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	623	Facts such as those of Mothercare or Hölterhoff would not fall within any of sub-sections -LRB- 1 -RRB- to -LRB- 3 -RRB- of section 92 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	624	89 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	625	On the second issue -LRB- the proper limits of trade mark use -RRB- I would not go so far as the Court of Appeal went in preferring the minority view in Musidor and in inclining to the view that every bootlegging case of this sort would involve trade mark use . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	626	It seems likely that Mr Johnstone would have had a difficult task in making good the defences on which he wished to rely . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	627	However , he should have been permitted to run them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	628	I agree with the Court of Appeal that his conviction -LRB- on his pleading guilty after not being allowed to put forward the defences on which he wished to rely -RRB- must be regarded as unsafe . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	629	I would therefore dismiss this appeal . 	lord walker	self	outcome	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	630	90 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	631	That is sufficient to dispose of the appeal itself , but there remain the issue of the burden of proof placed on the defendant by section 92 -LRB- 5 -RRB- , and further issues , on which your Lordships heard argument , whether R v Keane -LSB- 2001 -RSB- FSR 63 and R v S -LRB- Trade mark defence -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- EWCA Crim 2558 -RRB- were rightly decided . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
53	632	On all these issues I am in complete and respectful agreement with the speech of Lord Nicholls . 	lord walker	lord nicholls	NAN	1	lord nicholls, lord walker
