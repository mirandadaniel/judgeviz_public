23	14	It is not in dispute that the relevant provisions in the mortgage can be construed , as they were by the Court of Appeal , as imposing an obligation on Mr Alan Gold jointly with Mr Martin , but also severally , to pay to the bank not only monies advanced to the two of them jointly , but also monies advanced to Mr Martin alone for purposes which had no connection with Mr Gold .

23	16	Lord Millett has set out in his speech the reasons why a distributive construction could be adopted but for the reasons stated by Lord Scott and Lord Rodger I consider that the construction adopted by the Court of Appeal was correct and should be upheld . 	lord hutton	lord rodger	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	17	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	18	I would add one further observation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	19	It is a general rule in the construction of deeds that the intention of the parties is to be ascertained from the words used in the deed and that , with certain limited exceptions , extrinsic evidence can not be given to show the real intention of the parties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	20	On occasions this rule may lead to the actual intention of the parties being defeated but the rule is applied to ensure certainty in legal affairs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	21	In Mallan v May -LRB- 1844 -RRB- 13 M & W 511 , 517 Pollock CB stated : `` We must apply the ordinary rules of construction to this instrument ; and though , by so doing , we may , in some instances , probably in this , defeat the real intention of the parties , such a course tends to establish a greater degree of certainty in the administration of the law . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	22	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	23	However , whilst in the present case it would not have been permissible in construing the mortgage deed to take into account extrinsic evidence of the intention of the parties , I note with some satisfaction that it is apparent that the construction given to the mortgage by Lord Scott and Lord Rodger does not defeat the real intention of the parties . 	lord hutton	lord scott	partagr	0.1	lord scott
23	23	However , whilst in the present case it would not have been permissible in construing the mortgage deed to take into account extrinsic evidence of the intention of the parties , I note with some satisfaction that it is apparent that the construction given to the mortgage by Lord Scott and Lord Rodger does not defeat the real intention of the parties . 	lord hutton	lord rodger	partagr	0.1	lord scott
23	24	It is clear from the passage in the judgment of Jacob J on the non est factum point set out by Lord Scott in his speech that Mr Howard Gold , Mr Alan Gold 's solicitor upon whom he entirely relied , fully understood that the deed had the effect for which the bank contends and Jacob J added : `` He -LSB- Howard -RSB- had even ensured that such a clause did not apply when he and Alan gave supporting security for Mr Martin 's nursing home project . '' 	lord hutton	lord scott	partagr	0.1	lord scott
23	25	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	26	Accordingly I would dismiss the appeal . 	lord hutton	self	outcome	0.1	lord scott
23	27	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	28	LORD MILLETT 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	29	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	30	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	31	Your Lordships are concerned with the application of an interpretation clause contained in a standard form . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	32	Both features are significant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	33	A standard form is designed for use in a wide variety of different circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	34	It is not context-specific . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	35	Its value would be much diminished if it could not be relied upon as having the same meaning on all occasions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	36	Accordingly the relevance of the factual background of a particular case to its interpretation is necessarily limited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	37	The danger , of course , is that a standard form may be employed in circumstances for which it was not designed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	38	Unless the context in a particular case shows that this has happened , however , the interpretation of the form ought not to be affected by the factual background . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	39	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	40	The fact that the question concerns the application of an interpretation clause is also significant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	41	The purpose of such a clause is twofold . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	42	It shortens the drafting and avoids unnecessary repetition ; and it enables the form to be used in a variety of different situations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	43	It is not the purpose of such a clause to enlarge the parties ' rights and obligations beyond those provided by the operative provisions by imposing , for example , a secondary liability as surety in addition to a primary liability as principal debtor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	44	The application of such a clause is not merely a question of construction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	45	If it is capable of being applied to the operative provisions in more than one way , it should be applied in a way which serves its purpose rather than in a way which extends the parties ' obligations beyond those contemplated by the operative provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord scott
23	46	Of course , an interpretation clause may have this effect ; but if so it should do so plainly and unambiguously . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	47	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	48	The form which your Lordships are called upon to construe -LRB- `` the joint mortgage '' -RRB- is drafted for the case of a single mortgagor and employs an interpretation clause to adapt it for use where there are two or more mortgagors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	49	It is commonly used in cases where the mortgagors are husband and wife who are mortgaging the matrimonial home , where it is unlikely to give rise to difficulty ; but it may be used in other cases also where its use is more problematical . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	50	In the present case the mortgagors were partners who carried on a business in partnership together and each of whom also carried on his own separate business . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	51	The bank advanced money to the mortgagors jointly , and also to each of them separately . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	52	By the joint mortgage the mortgagors personally covenanted to repay the bank 's advances and charged their jointly owned properties by way of security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	53	By separate deeds entered into at the same time each of them also covenanted to pay and charged his own separately owned property with payment of his own liabilities to the bank , whether due from him alone or jointly with any other person and whether as principal or surety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	54	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	55	It is beyond dispute that the mortgagors thereby undertook a joint and several liability for the joint debts and charged the jointly owned properties to secure their repayment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	56	It is also beyond dispute that each of them also undertook a personal obligation to repay not only the joint debts but also his own separate debts , and charged his own separate properties to secure the repayment of all such debts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	57	The question is whether each of them also covenanted by way of guarantee to pay the debts of the other and charged his separate properties with such payment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	58	None of the documents contains an express guarantee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	59	If there is such a guarantee , it derives exclusively from the way in which the interpretation clause in the joint mortgage is applied to the operative provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	60	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	61	The relevant operative clause is clause 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the joint mortgage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	62	So far as material this reads : `` The mortgagor hereby covenants with ... the bank ... that it will on demand pay or discharge to the bank ... all sums of money ... advanced to the mortgagor by the bank ... '' When used by a single mortgagor there is no room for any surety liability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	63	There is complete identity between the covenantor and the subject-matter of the covenant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	64	The covenantor undertakes a personal obligation as principal debtor to repay money advanced to himself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	65	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	66	In the present case , however , `` the mortgagor '' is defined as `` Mr Martin and Mr Gold '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	67	Substituting these names for `` the mortgagor '' in the relevant clause produces the following : `` Mr Martin and Mr Gold hereby covenant with ... the bank ... that they will on demand pay or discharge to the bank ... all sums of money ... advanced to Mr Martin and Mr Gold by the bank ... '' There is still no room for any surety liability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	68	The identity between the covenantors and the subject-matter of the covenant , indicated by the repetition of the words `` the mortgagor '' , is retained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	69	The two covenantors are jointly liable for money advanced to them jointly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	70	They undertake a personal obligation as principal debtors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	71	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	72	The interpretation clause , however , contains an expanded definition to adapt the form for use where the expression `` the mortgagor '' includes more than one person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	73	In such a case , it provides that the expression `` shall be construed as referring to all and/or any one of those persons and the obligations of such persons hereunder shall be joint and several . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	74	Applying this to the words `` the mortgagor '' where they first appear in clause 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- has the effect of modifying the covenant but not its subject-matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	75	As modified the clause reads : `` Mr Martin and Mr Gold hereby jointly and severally covenant and each of them hereby severally covenants with ... the bank ... that they will on demand pay or discharge to the bank ... all sums of money ... advanced to Mr Martin and Mr Gold ... '' There is some duplication , but the effect is to produce three distinct covenants and three distinct obligations ; a joint and several covenant by both Mr Martin and Mr Gold and a separate covenant by each of them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord scott
23	76	Each of the covenants is a covenant to repay the money advanced to them jointly , so there is still no room for any surety liability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	77	The identity between the covenantors and the subject matter of the covenants indicated by the repetition of the words `` the mortgagors '' is retained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	78	They undertake joint and several obligations as principal debtors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	79	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	80	Applying the interpretation clause to the expression `` the mortgagor '' where it secondly appears in clause 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , however , modifies the subject-matter of the covenant and extends the covenantors ' liability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	81	The only question is : how far ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	82	If the interpretation clause is applied literally and comprehensively , clause 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- reads : `` Mr Martin and Mr Gold and each of them hereby jointly and severally covenant with ... the bank ... that they and each of them will on demand pay or discharge to the bank ... all sums of money ... advanced to Mr Martin and Mr Gold or either of them by the bank ... '' This produces no fewer than nine covenants : three joint and several covenants on the part of Mr Martin and Mr Gold to pay -LRB- i -RRB- their joint debts -LRB- ii -RRB- Mr Martin 's debts and -LRB- iii -RRB- Mr Gold 's debts ; three similar covenants by Mr Martin alone ; and three similar covenants by Mr Gold alone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	83	Each of the covenantors undertakes a personal liability both jointly with the other of them and separately to pay the moneys advanced -LRB- i -RRB- to both of them -LRB- ii -RRB- to himself and -LRB- iii -RRB- to the other of them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	84	The inclusion of -LRB- iii -RRB- breaks the identity between the covenantor and the subject-matter of the covenant indicated by the repetition of the words `` the mortgagor '' and introduces for the first time a secondary liability as surety . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	85	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	86	If this were the only possible way of applying the interpretation clause , it would have to be adopted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	87	But it is not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	88	It is perfectly possible to apply the clause distributively so as to avoid both unnecessary duplication and the introduction of secondary liability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	89	A distributive construction is commonly adopted when a plural subject is followed by a plural predicate and the plurals are broken down into their component singulars . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	90	An example from everyday speech would be to say : `` A and B took their children to school '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	91	Prima facie the word `` their '' means `` belonging to both of them '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	92	But this is not its only possible meaning , and if A and B are not married it is obviously not its meaning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	93	In that case the word `` their '' means `` of each of them '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	94	But this means that A and B took their respective children to school , not each other 's children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	95	The children are distributed to the relevant parent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	96	And it goes further than that . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	97	Although the word `` school '' is in the singular , it may conceal a plural . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	98	If necessary , the sentence means that A and B took the children to their respective schools . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	99	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	100	This is a well-established principle of construction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	101	It often , and perhaps usually , gives the words their most natural meaning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	102	It parades under a Latin name reddendo singula singulis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	103	This simply means that , when plurals are broken down , each singular component must be attributed to its respective singular and not to every other possible singular . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	104	It is a broad and general principle which departs from the literal and grammatical meaning and does not depend upon minutiae of language . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	105	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord scott
23	106	In the present case the principle would operate in two ways . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	107	It would apply the interpretation clause to clause 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- by attributing the obligation to repay the moneys advanced to Mr Martin and Mr Gold jointly to their joint and several covenant , thereby removing the unnecessary duplication resulting from the attribution of the same obligation to their individual covenants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	108	This reading preserves the identity between the covenantor and the subject-matter of the covenant , and makes no difference to the effect of the joint mortgage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	109	It is the most natural way to read the operative clause and ought not to be controversial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	110	Mr Martin and Mr Gold thereby jointly and severally covenant to pay the joint debts and each of them separately covenants to pay the separate debts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	111	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	112	Critically , however , a distributive application of the interpretation clause would not stop there . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	113	It would also attribute the obligation to repay the separate debts of `` the mortgagor '' , not to each member of the class , but to the relevant member who owed them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	114	This is a perfectly legitimate , and in my opinion the more natural , way to apply the interpretation clause . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	115	It treats a covenant by two or more persons -LRB- insofar as it means by each of them -RRB- to discharge their debts -LRB- in so far as it means the debts of each of them -RRB- as a covenant by each of them to discharge his own debts and not the debts of the other or others . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	116	Put shortly , it treats the obligation of two or more persons to pay their debts as an obligation to pay their respective debts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	117	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	118	This is `` an intellectually respectable way '' -LRB- see the judgment of Sedley LJ in the Court of Appeal -RRB- of reaching the conclusion which the Court of Appeal clearly wanted but felt unable to reach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	119	It is not clear to me why they refused to apply the interpretation clause distributively . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	120	They seem to have done so because it produces a result at variance with that produced by applying it comprehensively . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	121	But that is necessarily the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	122	The Court of Appeal assumed that the question was one of construing clause 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- after the interpretation clause has been applied to it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	123	But the real question is concerned with the proper way of applying the interpretation clause to clause 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	124	The Court of Appeal assumed that there was only one way to apply the clause , and did not consider whether a distributive application was the more appropriate way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	125	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	126	If legitimate , a distributive application of the interpretation clause in the present case is clearly appropriate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	127	It gives full effect to every word of the interpretation clause and its purpose in adapting the form to the case where there are two or more mortgagors , while retaining the identity between the covenantors and the subject-matter of their respective covenants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	128	It avoids the creation of a secondary liability not contemplated by the wording of the operative clause , which on its face creates one -LRB- or more -RRB- obligations of one -LRB- or more -RRB- principal debtors but no secondary liability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	129	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	130	In my opinion invoking clause 2 -LRB- 3 -RRB- begs the question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	131	Mr Martin and Mr Gold jointly and severally undertook to discharge the costs of the bank in relation to the joint mortgage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	132	Since the joint mortgage effected a charge on their jointly owned properties , it was appropriate to charge the bank 's costs in relation to the taking and realisation of the security to each of the mortgagors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	133	Assuming , without deciding , that such costs would also extend to the costs of proceedings to enforce the personal covenants in clause 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , the question whether either of them is liable under clause 2 -LRB- 3 -RRB- to pay the costs of proceedings against the other depends on the true construction of clause 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	134	Whether or not the interpretation clause is applied distributively to clause 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , the liability for costs is co-extensive with the substantive obligation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	135	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord scott
23	136	At the conclusion of argument I was persuaded that a distributive application of the interpretation clause is both legitimate and appropriate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
23	137	Your Lordships , however , are unanimously of the opinion that it is not legitimate , and I am not prepared to dissent from that view . 	lord millett	all	partagr	0.5	lord scott
23	138	Accordingly , with the same reluctance as was displayed by the Court of Appeal , I agree that the appeal should be dismissed . 	lord millett	self	outcome	0.5	lord scott
23	139	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
23	140	LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
23	141	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
23	142	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
23	143	The appeal before your Lordships raises a short point of construction of a mortgage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
23	144	The mortgage is in the standard form that at the date of the mortgage , 22 July 1993 , was used by lenders in the Allied Irish Banks group of companies for taking security from their borrowers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
23	145	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
23	146	There are two mortgagors , Mr Gold , who is the appellant and second defendant , and Mr Martin . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
23	147	In the description of the parties in the opening lines of the mortgage Mr Gold and Mr Martin are together described as `` the mortgagor '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
23	148	Clause 1 of the mortgage is an interpretation clause . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
23	149	It defines the term `` the mortgagor '' as `` the mortgagor named as such on page 1 hereof '' ie Mr Gold and Mr Martin . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
23	150	The last sentence of clause 1 says that `` If the expression ` the mortgagor ' includes more than one person it shall be construed as referring to all and/or any one of those persons and the obligations of such persons hereunder shall be joint and several '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
23	151	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
23	152	In clause 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the mortgage `` The mortgagor as beneficial owner hereby charges by way of legal mortgage all and singular the property or properties described or referred to in the Schedule hereto as a continuing security with payment to the bank and the company of all monies covenanted to be paid under clause 2 hereof '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
23	153	Fourteen properties were specified in the Schedule . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott

23	156	Clause 2 of the mortgage , which contains the payment covenant , is the clause that has led to the problem . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
23	157	I will set it out in full : `` 2 The mortgagor hereby covenants with each of the bank and the company that it will on demand pay or discharge to the bank and the company : - -LRB- 1 -RRB- all sums of money which have been or are now or may hereafter at any time or from time to time be advanced to the mortgagor by the bank or the company -LRB- as the case may be -RRB- ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- all other indebtedness and/or liabilities whatsoever of the mortgagor to the bank or the company -LRB- as the case may be -RRB- present , future , actual and/or contingent and whether on any banking or other account or otherwise in any manner whatsoever including such indebtedness and/or liabilities due under the terms hereof -LRB- whether alone or jointly with any other person and in whatever style , name or form and whether as principal or surety -RRB- ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- all costs and expenses incurred by the bank or the company in relation to this legal mortgage and/or any such advances , indebtedness and/or liabilities on a full indemnity basis ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- the amount of any acceptance or other credits and any cheques , notes or bills from time to time given or assumed by the bank or the company and all commission , discount and banking charges ; and -LRB- 5 -RRB- interest and charges upon or relating to all such advances , indebtedness , liabilities , unpaid interest , costs , and expenses , acceptance credits , cheques , notes , bills , commission , discount and banking charges , until demand at such rate or rates as have been or may from time to time be agreed between the mortgagor and the bank or the mortgagor and the company -LRB- as the case may be -RRB- , or in default of any agreed rate or rates and in any event from and after demand until full discharge -LRB- as well after as before judgment -RRB- at the specified rate of interest .

23	159	The issue is whether the clause 2 covenant makes Mr Gold liable to the bank for Mr Martin 's indebtedness to the bank arising out of advances to Mr Martin which had nothing to do with Mr Gold . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
23	160	The trial judge , Jacob J , and the Court of Appeal thought that it clearly did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
23	161	But , with the leave of the House , Mr Gold has appealed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
23	162	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
23	163	Before outlining the way in which the argument has been put , a little background needs to be mentioned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
23	164	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
23	165	Mr Gold is a dentist but formed a business partnership with Mr Martin , a property dealer , to acquire and develop properties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord scott
23	166	In order to pursue this enterprise they borrowed money from companies in the Allied Irish Banks Group . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	167	For convenience and simplicity I shall use the expression `` the bank '' to refer indiscriminately to the lender company , whichever company in the group it may have been , and to the respondent to this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	168	Mr Martin also acquired development properties on his own account and borrowed from the bank for that purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	169	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	170	In 1993 the bank decided to re-structure both the joint borrowings of Mr Gold and Mr Martin and the sole borrowings of Mr Martin . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	171	Facility letters dated 11 February 1993 were sent to the borrowers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	172	The letter to Mr Gold and Mr Martin offered them a joint facility of # 1,710,000 to be secured on forty-six specified properties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	173	Some of these properties were owned by the borrowers jointly , twenty - eight were owned by Mr Martin alone and two by Mr Gold alone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	174	The letter to Mr Martin offered him a facility of # 591,000 to be secured on the twenty-eight specified properties owned by Mr Martin alone and intended also as security for the joint facility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	175	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	176	The acceptance by the borrowers of the facilities offered by these letters led not only to the mortgage by Mr Gold and Mr Martin jointly , the construction of clause 2 of which is in issue , but also to a mortgage by Mr Gold of his two properties and a mortgage by Mr Martin of his twenty-eight properties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	177	Each of these individual mortgages was , of course , in the bank 's same standard form . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	178	The payment covenant in each of these would catch any indebtedness or liability of the mortgagor under the joint mortgage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	179	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	180	For the purposes of these arrangements with the bank Mr Gold was represented by a firm of solicitors , Mincoff Science and Gold -LRB- `` MSG '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	181	The partner in the firm who dealt with the matter on Mr Gold 's behalf was Mr Howard Gold , his brother . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	182	Mr Howard Gold knew the level of Mr Martin 's personal indebtedness to the bank as well as the amount of the joint indebtedness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	183	The second defendant Mr Gold signed the joint mortgage and his individual mortgage on Mr Howard Gold 's advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	184	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	185	Later , and for reasons that are not material , the bank called in the loans . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	186	The sale by the bank of the properties comprised in its security has been completed but has left a substantial shortfall . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	187	So the bank is attempting to enforce the clause 2 covenant for payment in the joint mortgage contending that Mr Gold and Martin thereby agreed to pay or discharge the indebtedness to the bank not only of the two of them jointly but also of each of them separately . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	188	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	189	Before Jacob J , it seems to have been accepted that clause 2 on its true construction did have the effect contended for by the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	190	The second defendant sought to escape by relying on a non est factum point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	191	In dealing with , and rejecting , this point , Jacob J referred to Mr Howard Gold 's knowledge of the mortgage and its effect : `` There is no doubt that Howard saw the final deed , including the ` frightening ' provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	192	Nor is there any doubt that he knew what their effect was . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	193	He had been concerned with similar clauses in the past , including for Alan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	194	... Howard also knew that the provisions were not theoretical in that Mr Martin undoubtedly did have debts owed to the bank . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	195	The `` frightening '' provisions to which the judge referred were sub-clauses -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- of clause 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord scott
23	196	The judge concluded : `` I can not see any room for non est factum here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	197	Alan signed without reading the document . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	198	He never read any documents approved by Howard . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	199	Howard was his appointed agent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	200	That is really the end of the case . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	201	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	202	The construction point that has been advanced before your Lordships was raised for the first time in the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	203	The construction contended for has been described , as a form of convenient shorthand , as a `` distributive '' construction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	204	It is contended that because `` the mortgagor '' , as defined , includes more than one person ie Mr Gold and Mr Martin , it should be construed as referring first to the two of them , next to one of them , and then to the other of them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	205	This distributive construction requires , it is said , that clause 2 be interpreted thus : `` A. Mr Gold and Mr Martin jointly and severally covenant to pay -LRB- 1 -RRB- all sums of money which have been advanced to them , Mr Gold and Mr Martin jointly , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- all other indebtedness and/or liabilities whatsoever of them , Mr Gold and Mr Martin , whether together or jointly with any other person and B. Mr Gold hereby covenants to pay -LRB- 1 -RRB- all sums of money which have been advanced to Mr Gold , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- all other indebtedness and/or liabilities whatsoever of Mr Gold whether alone or jointly with any other person and C. Mr Martin hereby covenants to pay -LRB- 1 -RRB- all sums of money which have been advanced to Mr Martin -LRB- 2 -RRB- all other indebtedness and/or liabilities whatsoever of Mr Martin whether alone or jointly with any other person . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	206	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	207	This is the so-called distributive construction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	208	If it were right , Mr Gold would not be liable to repay sums advanced to Mr Martin alone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	209	The Court of Appeal did not accept this construction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	210	Morritt LJ , who gave the leading judgment , said this : `` Once it is recognised that each reference to mortgagor includes Mr Martin and Mr Gold jointly , and Mr Martin and Mr Gold severally and in isolation from the others , then both the obligation to pay and the liability which that obligation extends to , is a several obligation of Mr Gold in relation to a several liability of Mr Martin , as well as the other way round ... '' 37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	211	Mr Davidson QC , counsel for Mr Gold , protests that this passage , while it plainly rejects the distributive construction contended for , does not explain why it does so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	212	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	213	Mr Davidson accepts that the construction contended for by the bank , and accepted by the Court of Appeal , is a legitimate construction but argues that the distributive construction , too , is legitimate and that the court , in choosing which of two legitimate constructions to adopt , should choose that which is more appropriate having regard to the factual matrix . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	214	The factual matrix , he says , supplies no reason why Mr Gold should have been expected to undertake personal liability for Mr Martin 's debts and that the distributive construction is , therefore , to be preferred . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	215	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	216	I am afraid that I do not find Mr Davidson 's submissions in the least compelling or clause 2 in the least ambiguous . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	217	The clause starts with a joint covenant by Mr Gold and Mr Martin . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	218	It is not three separate covenants , one by them jointly and one by each of them individually . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	219	It is a single joint covenant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	220	Their liability under this joint covenant is declared to be joint and several . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	221	This deals with the effect of their joint covenant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	222	It does not turn a single covenant into three covenants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	223	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	224	But the critical issue is not whether Mr Gold and Mr Martin , as well as jointly covenanting to pay , have severally covenanted to pay . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	225	The critical issue is what have they covenanted to pay ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord scott
23	226	Under sub-clause -LRB- 1 -RRB- they have covenanted to pay `` all sums of money ... advanced to the mortgagor by the bank ... '' The mortgagor means the two of them and/or each of them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
23	227	So they have covenanted to pay all sums of money advanced by the bank to the two of them and/or to each of them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
23	228	I do not understand how any process of construction can avoid the conclusion that they have covenanted to pay the sums advanced by the bank to Mr Martin alone as well as the sums advanced by the bank to them jointly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
23	229	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
23	230	The point is the same under sub-clause -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
23	231	Mr Gold and Mr Martin have covenanted to pay or discharge `` all other indebtedness and/or liabilities whatsoever of the mortgagor to the bank ... '' ie '' ... of the two of them and/or each of them ... '' So they have covenanted to pay or discharge the indebtedness of Mr Martin to the bank as well as their joint indebtedness to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
23	232	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
23	233	The distributive construction , which treats the single joint covenant as three separate covenants , makes no sense of sub-clause -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
23	234	Mr Gold and Mr Martin covenant to pay `` all costs and expenses incurred by the bank ... in relation to this legal mortgage ... '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
23	235	This would cover the costs of proceedings taken by the bank to enforce payment of the indebtedness of Mr Martin alone as well as the cost of proceedings to enforce payment of any joint indebtedness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
23	236	There is no reference in sub-clause -LRB- 3 -RRB- to ` the mortgagor ' and no distributive construction can exclude Mr Gold 's liability to pay all costs and expenses caught by the sub-clause , whether incurred in connection with the recovery of indebtedness for which Mr Martin is primarily liable or of any joint indebtedness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
23	237	A construction that excludes Mr Gold from liability in respect of advances to Mr Martin alone but leaves him liable to pay the bank 's costs of proceedings to recover those advances does not produce a result that could sensibly , or reasonably , have been intended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
23	238	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
23	239	In my opinion , there are no real difficulties of construction arising out of the reference to ` the mortgagor ' in clause 2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
23	240	As was succinctly put by Mr Cousins , following for the bank , clause 2 constitutes a covenant by Mr Gold and Mr Martin to pay their joint debts to the bank , to pay Mr Martin 's debts to the bank and to pay Mr Gold 's debts to the bank . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
23	241	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
23	242	This simple construction may leave Mr Gold under obligations that he had not foreseen and had not intended at the time he signed the joint mortgage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
23	243	But he has already succeeded in an action for negligence against the firm of solicitors who acted for him and , as I understand it , this appeal is being funded by their insurers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
23	244	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
23	245	In my opinion the Court of Appeal came to the correct conclusion for the correct reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
23	246	I would dismiss the appeal . 	lord scott	self	outcome	0.8	lord scott

23	251	I have had the privilege of reading in draft the speeches of both my noble and learned friends , Lord Millett and Lord Scott of Foscote . 	lord rodger	lord scott	ackn	0.8	lord scott
23	252	Despite Lord Millett 's reservations I have come to the view that the relevant provisions should be construed as Lord Scott proposes . 	lord rodger	lord millett	partdisa	0.8	lord scott
23	252	Despite Lord Millett 's reservations I have come to the view that the relevant provisions should be construed as Lord Scott proposes . 	lord rodger	lord scott	fullagr	0.8	lord scott
23	253	47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
23	254	There is , of course , no doubt about the value of the canon of interpretation which Lord Millett invokes . 	lord rodger	lord millett	partagr	0.8	lord scott
23	255	It occurs in a number of slightly different forms , all of them still - happily - in concise and precise Latin . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord scott
23	256	Like any other rule of interpretation , it is there to help to ascertain the objective meaning of the document in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	257	Like all such rules , it must be used with discrimination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	258	In this case I am by no means satisfied that applying it in the manner suggested would truly bring out the intended effect of clause 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	lord rodger	lord millett	partdisa	0.9	lord scott
23	259	48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	260	As Lord Scott points out , the covenant in clause 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- is a single covenant by the mortgagor which , by reason of the definition of `` the mortgagor '' in clause 1 , is `` joint and several '' . 	lord rodger	lord scott	partagr	0.9	lord scott
23	261	Prima facie - and without reading any further - the use of these words indicates that Mr Martin and Mr Gold are jointly and severally liable for any obligations to be specified in clause 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	262	In other words , each of them is liable to pay the whole or any part of the sums specified , as opposed to being liable simply to pay a pro rata -LRB- half -RRB- share of those sums . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	263	49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	264	It is necessary , however , to go further into clause 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- to discover for what sums Mr Martin and Mr Gold are to be liable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	265	As Lord Millett explains , if parsed out , clause 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- provides : `` Mr Martin and Mr Gold and each of them hereby jointly and severally covenant with ... the bank ... that they and each of them will on demand pay or discharge to the bank ... all sums of money ... advanced to Mr Martin and Mr Gold or either of them by the bank ... '' It is common ground that this provision can indeed be construed as imposing an obligation on Mr Gold , jointly with Mr Martin but also severally , to pay not only all sums of money advanced by the bank to Mr Martin and Mr Gold but also all sums advanced by the bank to either of them as an individual . 	lord rodger	lord millett	partagr	0.9	lord scott
23	266	In other words , Mr Gold is to be jointly and severally liable inter alia to pay the sums advanced by the bank to Mr Martin . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	267	Both Jacobs J and the Court of Appeal interpreted the provision in this way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	268	The suggestion is , however , that it would be preferable to interpret it reddendo singula singulis so that liability for the separate debts of the individuals making up `` the mortgagor '' would be attributed only to the individual who incurred the debt in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	269	The result is then that there is in effect a joint and several liability on Mr Martin and Mr Gold to pay the joint debts and a several liability on each of them to pay his separate debts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	270	On that footing Mr Gold is liable to pay his own separate debts to the bank but not Mr Martin 's . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	271	50 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	272	I accept , of course , that the rule of construction , reddendo singula singulis , could be applied to a document containing obligations on the part of two debtors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	273	So , for instance , a mortgage deed in which A and B covenanted to pay `` their debts '' might be interpreted , reddendo singula singulis , as meaning that each of them undertook to pay his own debts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	274	I am not persuaded , however , that in the present case the single covenant , for joint and several liability , should in effect be divided up so as to withdraw the separate debts of the individuals from the joint and several liability and then to subject them to a , separate , several liability of the relevant individual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	275	I do not question the intellectual respectability of the proposed way of reaching that result ; I simply do not believe that the result reflects the intention of the parties to this particular agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	276	51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	277	In part , at least , I have difficulty in accepting the second defendant 's construction because Mr Davidson acknowledged on his behalf that provisions making one of two debtors liable for the debts of the other are frequently found in documents used by banks and lending institutions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	278	This can be seen from a number of specimens which the bank produced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	279	For instance , in the case of the Royal Bank of Scotland , condition 12.2 - also dealing with interpretation - provides that , where two or more persons are included in the expression `` mortgagor '' , each of them is to be `` primarily liable by way of indemnity for the liabilities to the bank of the other or others of them '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	280	Counsel accepted that explicit provisions of this kind are indeed intended to make one debtor liable for the debts of the other and that they are valid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	281	Against that background I do not find the result produced by the straightforward interpretation of the wording of clause 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- surprising . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	282	52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	283	In the circumstances the second defendant 's argument had really to rest on the form of the provisions in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	284	In effect , counsel argued that definition clauses should not be interpreted so as to produce what are , in effect , important substantive effects on the obligations of the debtors concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	285	As is apparent , however , from the Royal Bank and other examples shown to the House , interpretation clauses of this kind are by no means unusual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord scott
23	286	In the absence of reported cases to the contrary , it must be assumed that they are given effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
23	287	53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
23	288	More positively , I note that in Wright v Tennent Caledonian Breweries Ltd 1991 SLT 823 - to which the House was not referred - the First Division of the Court of Session had to deal with a deed of variation of a loan agreement where `` the borrower '' was defined in a somewhat similar manner to `` the mortgagor '' in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
23	289	In particular , in the case of two or more individuals , the obligations and conditions affecting the borrower were to be binding on the individuals `` jointly and severally '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
23	290	Despite this , one of the debtors submitted that her liability under the loan agreement was only pro rata , because it would have required clear provisions in the deed of variation to incorporate the joint and several liability into the loan agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
23	291	The court rejected that argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
23	292	In his opinion , with which Lord Allanbridge and Lord Sutherland concurred , Lord President Hope said , at p 827 A - B : `` In my opinion the statement in clause 1.03 of the deed of variation that the obligations and conditions affecting the borrower shall be binding on two or more persons jointly and severally goes beyond a mere definition of the expression ` the borrower ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
23	293	It is concerned not with the question who is to be taken to be the borrower - that is to say , with the person or persons to whom that expression extends - but with the measure of the obligations undertaken by those persons in that capacity . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
23	294	He went on to say that the whole structure of the loan agreement as varied `` including the use of the expression ` the borrower ' in the singular at the outset to describe the two persons who are to receive the loan '' confirmed his view that the debtors ' liability under the agreement was joint and several -LRB- as opposed to pro rata -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
23	295	54 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
23	296	In much the same way , the definition of `` the mortgagor '' in the agreement in this case was not concerned simply with the question of who was to be taken to be the mortgagor : it dealt with the measure of the obligations which Mr Martin and Mr Gold undertook . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
23	297	It must be treated accordingly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
23	298	There may be various reasons why the draftsman of the bank 's standard form agreement chose to draft it in this particular way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
23	299	I need not go as far as the First Division and draw a positive inference from the use of the singular `` the mortgagor '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
23	300	It is sufficient that I find nothing in the chosen form of drafting which would , of itself , justify the House in adopting the second defendant 's preferred interpretation of clause 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord scott
