69	5	Can a person change the sex with which he or she is born ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
69	6	Stated in an over-simplified and question-begging form , this is the issue raised by this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
69	7	More specifically , the question is whether the petitioner , Mrs Elizabeth Bellinger , is validly married to Mr Michael Bellinger . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
69	8	On 2 May 1981 Mr and Mrs Bellinger went through a ceremony of marriage to each other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
69	9	Section 1 -LRB- c -RRB- of the Nullity of Marriage Act 1971 , re-enacted in section 11 -LRB- c -RRB- of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 , provides that a marriage is void unless the parties are ` respectively male and female ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
69	10	The question is whether , at the time of the marriage , Mrs Bellinger was ` female ' within the meaning of that expression in the statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
69	11	In these proceedings she seeks a declaration that the marriage was valid at its inception and is subsisting . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
69	12	The trial judge , Johnson J , refused to make this declaration : see -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 1 FLR 389 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
69	13	So did the Court of Appeal , by a majority of two to one : see -LSB- 2001 -RSB- EWCA Civ 1140 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 WLR 411 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN

69	17	In an alternative claim , advanced for the first time before your Lordships ' House , Mrs Bellinger seeks a declaration that section 11 -LRB- c -RRB- of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 is incompatible with articles 8 and 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN

69	20	Mrs Bellinger was born on 7 September 1946 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
69	21	At birth she was correctly classified and registered as male . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
69	22	That is common ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
69	23	For as long as she can remember , she felt more inclined to be female . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
69	24	She had an increasing urge to live as a woman rather than as a man . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
69	25	Despite her inclinations , and under some pressure , in 1967 she married a woman . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
69	26	She was then twenty one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
69	27	The marriage broke down . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN

69	32	When she married Mr Bellinger he was fully aware of her background . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	33	He has throughout been entirely supportive of her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	34	She was described on her marriage certificate as a spinster . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	35	Apart from that , the registrar did not ask about her gender status , nor did Mrs Bellinger volunteer any information . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN

69	37	The indicia of sex and transsexual people 5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	38	The indicia of human sex or gender -LRB- for present purposes the two terms are interchangeable -RRB- can be listed , in no particular order , as follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	39	-LRB- 1 -RRB- Chromosomes : XY pattern in males , XX in females . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	40	-LRB- 2 -RRB- Gonads : testes in males , ovaries in females . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	41	-LRB- 3 -RRB- Internal sex organs other than the gonads : for instance , sperm ducts in males , uterus in females . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	42	-LRB- 4 -RRB- External genitalia . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	43	-LRB- 5 -RRB- Hormonal patterns and secondary sexual characteristics , such as facial hair and body shape : no one suggests these criteria should be a primary factor in assigning sex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	44	-LRB- 6 -RRB- Style of upbringing and living . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	45	-LRB- 7 -RRB- Self-perception . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	46	Some medical research has suggested that this factor is not exclusively psychological . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	47	Rather , it is associated with biological differentiation within the brain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	48	The research has been very limited , and in the present state of neuroscience the existence of such an association remains speculative . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	49	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	50	In the vast majority of cases these indicia in an individual all point in the same direction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	51	There is no difficulty in assigning male or female gender to the individual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	52	But nature does not draw straight lines . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	53	Some people have the misfortune to be born with physiological characteristics which deviate from the normal in one or more respects , and to lesser or greater extent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	54	These people attract the convenient shorthand description of inter-sexual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	55	In such cases classification of the individual as male or female is best done by having regard to all the factors I have listed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	56	If every person has to be classified as either male or female , that is the best that can be done . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	57	That was the course , in line with medical opinion , followed by Charles J in W v W -LRB- Physical Inter-sex -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- Fam 111 , 146d-f . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	58	That is not the problem arising in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	59	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	60	Transsexual people are to be distinguished from inter-sexual people . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	61	Transsexual is the label given , not altogether happily , to a person who has the misfortune to be born with physical characteristics which are congruent but whose self-belief is incongruent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	62	Transsexual people are born with the anatomy of a person of one sex but with an unshakeable belief or feeling that they are persons of the opposite sex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	63	They experience themselves as being of the opposite sex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	64	Mrs Bellinger is such a person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	65	The aetiology of this condition remains uncertain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	66	It is now generally recognised as a psychiatric disorder , often known as gender dysphoria or gender identity disorder . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	67	It can result in acute psychological distress . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	68	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	69	The treatment of this condition depends upon its severity and the circumstances of the individual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	70	In severe cases conventional psychiatric treatment is inadequate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	71	Ultimately the most that medical science can do in order to alleviate the condition is , in appropriate cases , to rid the body of its intensely disliked features and make it accord , so far as possible , with the anatomy craved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	72	This is done by means of hormonal and other treatment and major surgery , popularly known as a ` sex change ' operation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	73	In this regard medical science and surgical expertise have advanced much in recent years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	74	Hormonal treatment can change a person 's secondary sexual characteristics . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	75	Irreversible surgery can adapt or remove genitalia and other organs , external and internal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	76	By this means a normal body of one sex can be altered so as to give the appearance of a normal body of the other sex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	77	But there are still limits to what can be done . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	78	Gonads can not be constructed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	79	The creation of replica genital organs is particularly difficult with female to male gender reassignment surgery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	80	Chromosomal patterns remain unchanged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	81	The change of body can never be complete . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	82	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	83	Surgery of this nature is the last step in what are typically four steps of treatment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	84	The four steps are psychiatric assessment , hormonal treatment , a period of living as a member of the opposite sex subject to professional supervision and therapy -LRB- the ` real life experience ' -RRB- , and finally , in suitable cases , gender reassignment surgery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	85	In February 1981 Mrs Bellinger , having been through the previous stages of treatment , successfully underwent this form of surgery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	86	This involved removal of her testes and penis and , in the words of Johnson J , ` the creation of an orifice which can be described as an artificial vagina , but she was still without uterus or ovaries or any other biological characteristics of a woman . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	87	A chromosomal test , dated 8 April 1999 , showed her to have a karyotype 46XY pattern , an apparently normal male karyotype . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	88	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	89	For completeness I should mention in passing that a transsexual person is to be distinguished from a homosexual person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	90	A homosexual is a person who is attracted sexually to persons of the same sex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
69	91	Nor should a transsexual person be confused with a transvestite . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	92	A transvestite is a person who , usually for the purpose of his or her sexual gratification , enjoys dressing in the clothes of the opposite sex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	93	The present state of the law 11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	94	The present state of English law regarding the sex of transsexual people is represented by the well known decision of Ormrod J in Corbett v Corbett -LSB- 1971 -RSB- P 83 , 104 , 106 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	95	That case , like the present one , concerned the gender of a male to female transsexual in the context of the validity of a marriage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	96	Ormrod J held that , in this context , the law should adopt the chromosomal , gonadal and genital tests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	97	If all three are congruent , that should determine a person 's sex for the purpose of marriage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	98	Any operative intervention should be ignored . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	99	The biological sexual constitution of an individual is fixed at birth , at the latest , and can not be changed either by the natural development of organs of the opposite sex or by medical or surgical means . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	100	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	101	In R v Tan -LSB- 1983 -RSB- QB 1053 , 1063-1064 , the Court of Appeal , comprising May LJ and Parker and Staughton JJ , applied the Corbett approach in the context of criminal law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	102	The court upheld convictions which were dependent on Gloria Greaves , a post-operative male to female transsexual , still being in law a man . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	103	In S-T -LRB- formerly J -RRB- v J -LSB- 1998 -RSB- Fam 103 , 122 , a case of a female to male transsexual , the correctness of the decision in Corbett seems not to have been challenged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	104	But Ward LJ suggested that the decision would bear re-examination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	105	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	106	The decision in Corbett has attracted much criticism , from the medical profession and elsewhere . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	107	The criteria for designating a person as male or female are complex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	108	It is too ` reductionistic ' to have regard only to the three Corbett factors of chromosomes , gonads and genitalia . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	109	This approach ignores ` the compelling significance of the psychological status of the person as a man or a woman ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	110	Further , the application of the Corbett approach leads to a substantially different outcome in the cases of a post-operative inter-sexual person and a post-operative transsexual person , even though , post-operatively , the bodies of the two individuals may be remarkably similar . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	111	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	112	In overseas jurisdictions Corbett has not been universally followed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	113	It was followed , for instance , in South Africa in W v W -LRB- 1976 -RRB- -LRB- 2 -RRB- SALR 308 and in Canada in M v M -LRB- A -RRB- -LRB- 1984 -RRB- 42 RFL -LRB- 2d -RRB- 267 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	114	But more recently the trend has been in the opposite direction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	115	Thus , for instance , in New Zealand and Australia post-operative transsexuals ' assigned sex has been recognised for the purpose of validating their marriages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	116	In New Zealand in Attorney-General v Otahuhu Family Court -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 1 NZLR 603 , 630 , Ellis J noted that once a transsexual person has undergone surgery , he or she is no longer able to operate in his or her original sex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	117	He held there is no social advantage in the law not recognising the validity of the marriage of a transsexual in the sex of reassignment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	118	An adequate test is whether the person in question has undergone surgical and medical procedures that have effectively given the person the physical conformation of a person of a specified sex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	119	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	120	In Australia Chisholm J reached a similar conclusion in Re Kevin -LRB- validity of marriage of transsexual -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- Fam CA 1074 , a case decided after the decision of the Court of Appeal in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	121	Chisholm J 's extensive judgment contains a powerful critique of the existing law and a useful review of international developments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	122	Having regard to the view I take of this case , it is not necessary for me to elaborate on his views . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	123	Suffice to say , his conclusion was that there is no ` formulaic solution ' to determining the sex of an individual for the purpose of the law of marriage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	124	All relevant matters need to be considered , including the person 's life experiences and self-perception . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	125	Post-operative transsexual people will normally be members of their reassigned sex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	126	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	127	This decision was the subject of an appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	128	Very recently , on 21 February 2003 , the full court of the Federal Family Court dismissed the appeal : Appeal no . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	129	EA/97/2001 -LRB- unreported -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	130	The judgment of the full court contains an invaluable survey of the authorities and the issues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	131	The court concluded that in the relevant Commonwealth marriage statute the words ` man ' and ` woman ' should be given their ordinary , everyday contemporary meaning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	132	Chisholm J. was entitled to conclude , as a question of fact , that the word ` man ' includes a post-operative female to male transsexual person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	133	The full court left open the ` more difficult ' question of pre-operative transsexual persons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	134	The decisions of the courts below 17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	135	The trial judge , Johnson J , recognised there has been a marked change in social attitudes to problems such as those of Mrs Bellinger since Corbett v Corbett -LSB- 1971 -RSB- P 83 was decided in 1970 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	136	The law on this matter in this country is , or is becoming , a minority position , at least so far as Europe is concerned . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	137	But the law is clear , and as a judge he had to accept the law as it is . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	138	What is also clear is that this is no simple matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	139	Potentially there are serious implications to be considered in relation to the law of marriage and other areas of life : see -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 1 FLR 389 , 402 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	140	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	141	Likewise , the majority of the Court of Appeal , having considered up to date medical evidence , adhered to the Corbett approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	142	The three criteria relied upon by Ormrod J remain the only basis upon which to decide upon the gender of a child at birth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	143	There is , in informed medical circles , a growing momentum for recognition of transsexual people for every purpose and in a manner similar to those who are inter-sexed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	144	This reflects changes in social attitudes as well as advances in medical research . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	145	But recognition of a change of gender for the purposes of marriage would require some certainty regarding the point at which the change takes place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	146	This point is not easily ascertainable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	147	At what point would it be consistent with public policy to recognise that a person should be treated for all purposes , including marriage , as a person of the opposite sex to that which he or she was correctly assigned at birth ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	148	This is a question for Parliament , not the courts : see -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 WLR 411 , 434-436 , paras 97-109 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	149	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	150	In his dissenting judgment Thorpe LJ questioned whether it was right , particularly in the context of marriage , to make the chromosomal factor conclusive , or even dominant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
69	151	It is an invisible feature of an individual , incapable of perception other than by scientific test . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	152	In the context of the institution of marriage as it is today it is right to give predominance to psychological factors and to carry out the essential assessment of gender at or shortly before the time of marriage rather than at the time of birth : -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 WLR 411 , 449 , para 155 .

69	154	This issue has been before the European Court of Human Rights on several occasions in the last twenty years . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	155	During this period the development of human rights law on this issue has been remarkably rapid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	156	Until very recently the court consistently held that application of the Corbett criteria , and consequent non-recognition of change of gender by post-operative transsexual persons , did not constitute a violation of article 8 -LRB- right to respect for private life -RRB- or article 12 -LRB- right to marry -RRB- : Rees v United Kingdom -LRB- 1986 -RRB- 9 EHRR 56 , Cossey v United Kingdom -LRB- 1990 -RRB- 13 EHRR 622 , and Sheffield and Horsham v United Kingdom -LRB- 1998 -RRB- 27 EHRR 163 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	157	It is to be noted , however , that in the latter case the court was critical of the United Kingdom 's apparent failure to take any steps to keep this area of the law under review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	158	There is , the court said , an increased social acceptance of transsexualism and an increased recognition of the problems which post-operative transsexual people encounter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	159	The court reiterated that this area ` needs to be kept under review by Contracting States ' : para 60 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	160	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	161	In its most recent decision the court has taken the view that the sands of time have run out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	162	The United Kingdom 's margin of appreciation no longer extends to declining to give legal recognition to all cases of gender reassignment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	163	This was the decision of the court , sitting as a grand chamber , in the case of Goodwin v United Kingdom -LRB- 2002 -RRB- 35 EHRR 18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	164	Judgment was given in July 2002 , that is , after the Court of Appeal gave its judgment in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	165	Christine Goodwin was a post-operative male to female transsexual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	166	The court held unanimously that the United Kingdom was in breach of articles 8 and 12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	167	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	168	The court 's judgment was wide-ranging . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	169	As it happens , this was not a ` marriage ' case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	170	Christine Goodwin had married as a man and later been divorced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	171	Her complaint was that in several respects she , as a post-operative transsexual person , was not treated fairly by the laws or practices of this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	172	She was unable to pursue a claim for sexual harassment in an employment tribunal because she was considered in law to be a man . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	173	She was not eligible for a state pension at 60 , the age of entitlement for women . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	174	She remained obliged to pay the higher car insurance premiums applicable to men . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	175	In many instances she had to choose between revealing her birth certificate and foregoing advantages conditional upon her producing her birth certificate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	176	Her inability to marry as a woman seems not to have been the subject of specific complaint by her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	177	But in its judgment the court expressed its views on this and other aspects of the lack of legal recognition of her gender reassignment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	178	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	179	Some of the main points in the judgment of the court can be summarised as follows . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	180	In the interests of legal certainty , foreseeability and equality before the law the court should not depart , without good reason , from precedents laid down in previous cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	181	But the court must have regard to changing conditions within the respondent state and within contracting states generally . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	182	The court must respond to any evolving convergence on the standards to be achieved : para 74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	183	A test of congruent biological factors can no longer be decisive in denying legal recognition to the change of gender of a post-operative transsexual : para 100 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	184	With increasingly sophisticated types of surgery and hormonal treatments the principal unchanging biological aspect of gender identity is the chromosomal element . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	185	It is not apparent that this must inevitably be of decisive significance : para 82 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	186	The court recognised that it is for a contracting state to determine , amongst other matters , the conditions under which a person claiming legal recognition as a transsexual establishes that gender re-assignment has been properly effected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	187	But it found ` no justification for barring the transsexual from enjoying the right to marry under any circumstances ' : para 103 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	188	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	189	This decision of the court was essentially prospective in character . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	190	The court made this plain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	191	Until 1998 , the date of the decision in Sheffield and Horsham v United Kingdom -LRB- 1998 -RRB- 27 EHRR 163 , the court had found that the United Kingdom 's treatment of post-operative transsexual people was within this country 's margin of appreciation and that this treatment did not violate the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	192	By the Goodwin decision the court found that ` the situation , as it has evolved , no longer falls within the United Kingdom 's margin of appreciation ' : paras 119-120 -LRB- emphasis added -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	193	Developments since the Goodwin decision 25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	194	This decision of the European Court of Human Rights prompted three developments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	195	First , in written answers to the House of Commons on 23 July 2002 , the Parliamentary Secretary to the Lord Chancellor 's Department noted that the interdepartmental working group on transsexual people had been reconvened . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	196	Its terms of reference include re-examining the implications of granting full legal status to transsexual people in their acquired gender . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	197	The minister stated that the working group had been asked to consider urgently the implications of the Goodwin judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	198	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	199	The second development has an important bearing on the outcome of this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	200	On 13 December 2002 the government announced its intention to bring forward primary legislation which will allow transsexual people who can demonstrate they have taken decisive steps towards living fully and permanently in the acquired gender to marry in that gender . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	201	The legislation will also deal with other issues arising from the legal recognition of acquired gender . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	202	A draft outline Bill will be published in due course . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	203	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	204	The third development was that before your Lordships ' House counsel for the Lord Chancellor accepted that , from the time of the Goodwin decision , those parts of English law which fail to give legal recognition to the acquired gender of transsexual persons are in principle incompatible with articles 8 and 12 of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	205	Domestic law , including section 11 -LRB- c -RRB- of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 , will have to change . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	206	Gender reassignment 28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	207	The distinction between male and female exists throughout the animal world . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	208	It corresponds to the different roles played in the reproductive process . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	209	A male produces sperm which fertilise the female 's eggs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	210	In this country , as elsewhere , classification of a person as male or female has long conferred a legal status . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
69	211	It confers a legal status , in that legal as well as practical consequences follow from the recognition of a person as male or female . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	212	The legal consequences affect many areas of life , from marriage and family law to gender-specific crime and competitive sport . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	213	It is not surprising , therefore , that society through its laws decides what objective biological criteria should be applied when categorising a person as male or female . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	214	Individuals can not choose for themselves whether they wish to be known or treated as male or female . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	215	Self-definition is not acceptable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	216	That would make nonsense of the underlying biological basis of the distinction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	217	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	218	This approach did not give rise to legal difficulty before the advent of gender reassignment treatment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	219	This was noted by Lord Reed in his article ` Splitting the difference : transsexuals and European Human Rights law ' -LRB- September 2000 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	220	Gender identity disorder seems always to have existed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	221	But before the advent of gender reassignment treatment a claim by a transsexual person to be recognised in his or her self-perceived gender would have been hopeless . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	222	The anatomy of his or her body of itself would have refuted the claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	223	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	224	The position has now changed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	225	Recognition of transsexualism as a psychiatric disorder has been accompanied by the development of sophisticated techniques of medical treatment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	226	The anatomical appearance of the body can be substantially altered , by forms of treatment which are permissible as well as possible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	227	It is in these changed circumstances that society is now facing the question of how far it is prepared to go to alleviate the plight of the small minority of people who suffer from this medical condition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	228	Should self-perceived gender be recognised ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	229	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	230	Recognition of gender reassignment will involve some blurring of the normally accepted biological distinction between male and female . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	231	Some blurring already exists , unavoidably , in the case of inter-sexual persons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	232	When assessing the gender of inter-sexual persons , matters taken into account include self-perception and style of upbringing and living . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	233	Recognition of gender reassignment will involve further blurring . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	234	It will mean that in law a person who , unlike an inter-sexual person , had all the biological characteristics of one sex at birth may subsequently be treated as a member of the opposite sex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	235	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	236	Thus the circumstances in which , and the purposes for which , gender reassignment is recognised are matters of much importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	237	These are not easy questions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	238	The circumstances of transsexual people vary widely . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	239	The distinction between male and female is material in widely differing contexts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	240	The criteria appropriate for recognising self-perceived gender in one context , such as marriage , may not be appropriate in another , such as competitive sport . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	241	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	242	Stated very shortly , this is the setting for the legal issues arising on this appeal , to which I now turn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	243	Gender and marriage : part of a wider problem 34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	244	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	245	I am profoundly conscious of the humanitarian considerations underlying Mrs Bellinger 's claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	246	Much suffering is involved for those afflicted with gender identity disorder . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	247	Mrs Bellinger and others similarly placed do not undergo prolonged and painful surgery unless their turmoil is such that they can not otherwise live with themselves . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	248	Non-recognition of their reassigned gender can cause them acute distress . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	249	I have this very much in mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	250	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	251	I also have in mind that increasingly , in the more compassionate times in which we live , there is an international trend towards recognising gender reassignment and not condemning post-operative transsexual people to live in what was aptly described by the European Court of Human Rights in the Goodwin case as an intermediate zone , not quite one gender or the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	252	And in this country gender reassignment has already received legal recognition for some purposes , for example , for the purpose of the discrimination legislation , in section 2A of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	253	This section was introduced into the statute by the Sexual Discrimination -LRB- Gender Re-assignment -RRB- Regulations 1999 -LRB- SI 1999/1102 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	254	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	255	Despite this , I am firmly of the view that your Lordships ' House , sitting in its judicial capacity , ought not to accede to the submissions made on behalf of Mrs Bellinger . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	256	Recognition of Mrs Bellinger as female for the purposes of section 11 -LRB- c -RRB- of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 would necessitate giving the expressions ` male ' and ` female ' in that Act a novel , extended meaning : that a person may be born with one sex but later become , or become regarded as , a person of the opposite sex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	257	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	258	This would represent a major change in the law , having far reaching ramifications . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	259	It raises issues whose solution calls for extensive enquiry and the widest public consultation and discussion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	260	Questions of social policy and administrative feasibility arise at several points , and their interaction has to be evaluated and balanced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	261	The issues are altogether ill-suited for determination by courts and court procedures . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	262	They are pre-eminently a matter for Parliament , the more especially when the government , in unequivocal terms , has already announced its intention to introduce comprehensive primary legislation on this difficult and sensitive subject . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	263	Given this latter circumstance , intervention by the courts would be peculiarly inappropriate when the change being sought in the law raises issues such as the following . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	264	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	265	First , much uncertainty surrounds the circumstances in which gender reassignment should be recognised for the purposes of marriage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	266	The present case concerns one individual and her particular condition and circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	267	Although some of the evidence produced is of a general nature , the evidence before the House is focused on the facts of this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	268	So were the arguments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	269	In particular , Miss Scriven QC submitted that wherever the line marking the transition from one sex to the other is to be drawn , Mrs Bellinger is on the reassigned gender side of the line . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	NAN
69	270	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	271	I do not consider this would be a proper or , indeed , a responsible basis on which to change the law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	272	Surgical intervention takes many forms and , for a variety of reasons , is undertaken by different people to different extents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	273	For men it may mean castration or inversion of the penis to create a false vagina . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	274	For women it may mean a mastectomy , hysterectomy , or creation of a false penis by phalloplasty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	275	There seems to be no ` standard ' operation or recognised definition of the outcome of completed surgery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	276	Today the case before the House concerns Mrs Bellinger . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	277	Tomorrow 's case in the High Court will relate to a transsexual person who has been able to undergo a less extensive course of surgery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	278	The following week will be the case of a transsexual person who has undergone hormonal treatment but who , for medical reasons , has not been able to undergo any surgery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	279	Then there will be a transsexual person who is medically able to undergo all or part of the surgery but who does not wish to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	280	By what criteria are cases such as these to be decided ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	281	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	282	But the problem is more fundamental than this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	283	It is questionable whether the successful completion of some sort of surgical intervention should be an essential prerequisite to the recognition of gender reassignment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	284	If it were , individuals may find themselves coerced into major surgical operations they otherwise would not have . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	285	But the aim of the surgery is to make the individual feel more comfortable with his or her body , not to ` turn a man into a woman ' or vice versa . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	286	As one medical report has expressed it , a male to female transsexual person is no less a woman for not having had surgery , or any more a woman for having had it : see Secretary , Department of Social Security v SRA -LRB- 1993 -RRB- 118 ALR 467 , 477 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	287	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	288	These are deep waters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	289	Plainly , there must be some objective , publicly available criteria by which gender reassignment is to be assessed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	290	If possible the criteria should be capable of being applied readily so as to produce a reasonably clear answer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	291	Parties proposing to enter into a marriage relationship need to know whether their marriage will be valid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	292	Other people need to know whether a marriage was valid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	293	Marriage has legal consequences in many directions : for instance , housing and residential security of tenure , social security benefits , citizenship and immigration , taxation , pensions , inheritance , life insurance policies , criminal law -LRB- bigamy -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	294	There must be an adequate degree of certainty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	295	Otherwise , as the majority of the Court of Appeal observed , the applicability of the law to an individual suffering from gender identity disorder would be in a state of complete confusion : see -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 WLR 411 , 435 , para 104 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	296	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	297	Your Lordships ' House is not in a position to decide where the demarcation line could sensibly or reasonably be drawn . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	298	Where this line should be drawn is far from self-evident . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	299	The antipodean decisions of Attorney-General v Otahuhu Family Court -LSB- 1995 -RSB- 1 NZLR 603 and Re Kevin -LRB- validity of marriage of transsexual -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- Fam CA 1074 and App . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	300	EA 97/2001 have not identified any clear , persuasive principle in this regard . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	301	Nor has the dissenting judgment of Thorpe LJ in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	302	Nor has the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Goodwin v United Kingdom -LRB- 2002 -RRB- 35 EHRR 18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	303	Nor is there uniformity among the thirteen member states of the European Union which afford legal recognition to a transsexual person 's acquired gender . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	304	The pre-conditions for recognition vary considerably . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	305	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	306	Further , the House is not in a position to give guidance on what other pre-conditions should be satisfied before legal recognition is given to a transsexual person 's acquired gender . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	307	Some member states of the European Union insist on the applicant being single or on existing marriages being dissolved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	308	Some insist on the applicant being sterile . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	309	Questions arise about the practical mechanisms and procedures for obtaining recognition of acquired gender , and about the problem of people who ` revert ' to their original gender after a period in their new gender role . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	310	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	311	Secondly , the recognition of gender reassignment for the purposes of marriage is part of a wider problem which should be considered as a whole and not dealt with in a piecemeal fashion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	312	There should be a clear , coherent policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	313	The decision regarding recognition of gender reassignment for the purpose of marriage can not sensibly be made in isolation from a decision on the like problem in other areas where a distinction is drawn between people on the basis of gender . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	314	These areas include education , child care , occupational qualifications , criminal law -LRB- gender-specific offences -RRB- , prison regulations , sport , the needs of decency , and birth certificates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	315	Birth certificates , indeed , are one of the matters of most concern to transsexual people , because birth certificates are frequently required as proof of identity or age or place of birth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	316	When , and in what circumstances , should these certificates be capable of being reissued in a revised form which does not disclose that the person has undergone gender reassignment ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	317	46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	318	Thirdly , even in the context of marriage , the present question raises wider issues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	319	Marriage is an institution , or relationship , deeply embedded in the religious and social culture of this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	320	It is deeply embedded as a relationship between two persons of the opposite sex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	321	There was a time when the reproductive functions of male and female were regarded as the primary raison d'être of marriage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	322	The Church of England Book of Common Prayer of 1662 declared that the first cause for which matrimony was ordained was the ` procreation of children ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	323	For centuries this was proclaimed at innumerable marriage services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	324	For a long time now the emphasis has been different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	325	Variously expressed , there is much more emphasis now on the ` mutual society , help and comfort that the one ought to have of the other ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	326	47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	327	Against this background there are those who urge that the special relationship of marriage should not now be confined to persons of the opposite sex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	328	It should be possible for persons of the same sex to marry . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	329	This , it is said , is the appropriate way to resolve problems such as those confronting Mrs Bellinger . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	NAN
69	330	48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	331	It hardly needs saying that this approach would involve a fundamental change in the traditional concept of marriage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	332	Here again , this raises a question which ought to be considered as part of an overall review of the most appropriate way to deal with the difficulties confronting transsexual people . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	333	49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	334	For these reasons I would not make a declaration that the marriage celebrated between Mr and Mrs Bellinger in 1981 was valid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	335	A change in the law as sought by Mrs Bellinger must be a matter for deliberation and decision by Parliament when the forthcoming Bill is introduced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	336	Declaration of incompatibility 50 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	337	Mrs Bellinger advanced a further , alternative claim for a declaration that in so far as section 11 -LRB- c -RRB- of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 makes no provision for the recognition of gender reassignment it is incompatible with articles 8 and 12 of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	338	Her claim is advanced on the footing that , although she and Mr Bellinger celebrated their marriage long before the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force , and although the Goodwin decision dealt with the human rights position as at the date of the judgment -LRB- July 2002 -RRB- , the non-recognition of their ability to marry continues to have adverse practical effects . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	339	The statute continues to prevent them marrying each other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	340	51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	341	Mr Sales advanced several arguments on why such a declaration should not be made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	342	There is , he submitted , no present incompatibility between the statute and the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	343	The European Court of Human Rights , in its decision in Goodwin , envisaged that the government should have a reasonable period in which to amend domestic law on a principled and coherent basis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	344	The court said it ` will be for the United Kingdom Government in due course to implement such measures as it considers appropriate to fulfil its obligations ' : see -LRB- 2002 -RRB- 35 EHRR 18 , 33 , paragraph 120 -LRB- emphasis added -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	345	52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	346	I can not accept this submission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	347	It may be that , echoing the language of the European Court of Human Rights in Marckx v Belgium -LRB- 1979 -RRB- 2 EHRR 330 , 353 , para 58 , the principle of legal certainty dispenses the United Kingdom government from re-opening legal acts or situations which antedate the judgment in Goodwin . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	348	But that is not the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	349	In the present case section 11 -LRB- c -RRB- of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 remains a continuing obstacle to Mr and Mrs Bellinger marrying each other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	350	53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	351	It may also be that there are circumstances where maintaining an offending law in operation for a reasonable period pending enactment of corrective legislation is justifiable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	352	An individual may not then be able , during the transitional period , to complain that his rights have been violated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	353	The admissibility decision of the court in Walden v Liechtenstein -LRB- App no 33916/96 -RRB- is an example of this pragmatic approach to the practicalities of government . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	354	But the question now under consideration is different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	355	It is more general . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	356	The question is whether non-recognition of gender reassignment for the purposes of marriage is compatible with articles 8 and 12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	357	The answer to this question is clear : it is not compatible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	358	The European Court of Human Rights so found in July 2002 in Goodwin , and the government has so accepted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN

69	365	But the minister 's powers have already been triggered in the present case under section 10 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- , by reason of the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in the Goodwin case and the associated case of I v United Kingdom -LRB- App no. 25680/94 -RRB- .

69	386	The essence of the problem , as I see it , lies in the impossibility of changing completely the sex which individuals acquire when they are born . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	387	A great deal can be done to remove the physical features of the sex from which the transsexual wishes to escape and to reproduce those of the sex which he or she wishes to acquire . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN

69	389	But medical science is unable , in its present state , to complete the process . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
69	390	It can not turn a man into a woman or turn a woman into a man . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	391	That is not what the treatment seeks to do after all , although it is described as gender reassignment surgery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN

69	394	At best , what is provided is no more than an imitation of the more obvious parts of that equipment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN

69	416	Lockhart J said in the SRA case at p 480 that the common understanding of the words `` woman '' and female '' and the phrase `` opposite sex '' , which were ordinary English words , was a question of fact and that the crucial question was whether different conclusions were reasonably possible as to whether the facts or circumstances fell within their ordinary meaning .

NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	418	He went on to say that there was no formulaic solution for determining the sex of an individual for this purpose , that all relevant factors had to be considered including the person 's biological and physical characteristics at birth , the person 's life experiences , the extent to which the person has functioned in society as a man or woman , any hormonal , surgical or other medical sex reassignment treatments the person has undergone and the consequences of such treatment and that it was clear from the Australian authorities that post-operative transsexuals will normally be members of their reassigned sex : paras 328-329 .

NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	422	The essence of that decision is to be found in the following paragraphs : `` 110 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	423	The definition of ` marriage ' is essentially connected with the term ` man ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	424	In these circumstances , for the reasons stated by the trial judge as amplified by our reasons that appear subsequently , we take the view that the words ` marriage ' and ` man ' are not technical terms and should be given their ordinary contemporary meaning in the context of the Marriage Act . 	lord hope	all	partagr	0.7	NAN
69	425	111 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	426	In our view , it thus becomes a question of fact as to what the contemporary , everyday meanings of the words ` marriage ' and ` man ' are respectively . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	427	112 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	428	It is then a question of law for this court to determine whether , on the facts found by the trial judge , it was open to him to reach the conclusion that he did , namely that at the relevant time , Kevin was a man and that the marriage was therefore valid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	429	As it was in SRA -LRB- supra -RRB- so , too , it is that the answer to that question is ` at the heart of the present case ' . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	430	62 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	431	I need hardly say that I entirely agree with the Australian judges that the words `` male '' and `` female '' in section 11 -LRB- c -RRB- of the 1973 Act , which is the provision with which we are faced in this case , are not technical terms and that they must be given their ordinary , everyday meaning in the English language . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	432	But no evidence was placed before us to suggest that in contemporary usage in this country , on whichever date one might wish to select - 23 May 1973 when the 1973 Act was enacted , 2 May 1981 when Mr and Mrs Bellinger entered into their marriage ceremony or the date of this judgment , these words can be taken to include post-operative transsexual persons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	433	The definition of `` male '' in the New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary -LRB- 1993 -RRB- tells us that its primary meaning when used as an adjective is `` of , pertaining to , or designating the sex which can beget offspring '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	434	No mention is made anywhere in the extended definition of the word of transsexual persons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	435	The word `` transsexual '' is defined as `` having the physical characteristics of one sex but a strong and persistent desire to belong to the other . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	436	I see no escape from the conclusion that these definitions , with which the decision in Corbett v Corbett -LSB- 1971 -RSB- P 83 and the views of the majority in the Court of Appeal in this case are consistent , are both complete and accurate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	437	The fact is that the ordinary meaning of the word `` male '' is incapable , without more , of accommodating the transsexual person within its scope . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	438	The Australian cases show that a distinction has to be drawn , even according to the contemporary usage of the word in Australia , between pre-operative and post-operative transsexuals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	439	Distinctions of that kind raise questions of fact and degree which are absent from the ordinary meaning of the word `` male '' in this country . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	440	Any attempt to enlarge its meaning would be bound to lead to difficulty , as there is no single agreed criterion by which it could be determined whether or not a transsexual was sufficiently `` male '' for the purpose of entering into a valid marriage ceremony . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	441	63 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	442	In Goodwin v United Kingdom -LRB- 2002 -RRB- 35 EHRR 18 , 24 , paras 82-83 the European Court of Human Rights noted that it remains the case , as the court held in Sheffield and Horsham v United Kingdom -LRB- 1998 -RRB- 27 EHRR 163 , that a transsexual can not acquire all the biological characteristics of the assigned sex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	443	It went on to say that it was not apparent in the light of increasingly sophisticated surgery and hormonal techniques that the chromosomal element , which is the principal unchanging biological aspect of gender identity , must inevitably take on decisive significance for the purpose of legal attribution of gender identity for post-operative transsexuals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	444	So it was not persuaded that the state of medical science or scientific knowledge provided any determining argument as regards the legal recognition of transsexuals on grounds of social and legal policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	445	But this approach is not at all inconsistent with the view which I would take of the facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	446	The question which the court was asking itself was not whether the applicant , who was of the male sex when she was born , was now female . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	447	Post-operative transsexuals were assumed to fall into a distinct category . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	448	The question was whether it was a breach of their Convention rights for legal recognition to be denied to their new sexual identity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	449	64 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
69	450	Of course , it is not given to every man or every woman to have , or to want to have , children . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	451	But the ability to reproduce one 's own kind lies at the heart of all creation , and the single characteristic which invariably distinguishes the adult male from the adult female throughout the animal kingdom is the part which each sex plays in the act of reproduction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	452	When Parliament used the words `` male '' and female '' in section 11 -LRB- c -RRB- of the 1973 Act it must be taken to have used those words in the sense which they normally have when they are used to describe a person 's sex , even though they are plainly capable of including men and women who happen to be infertile or are past the age of child bearing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	453	I think that section 5 -LRB- 4 -RRB- -LRB- e -RRB- of the Marriage -LRB- Scotland -RRB- Act 1977 , which provides there is a legal impediment to a marriage in Scots law where the parties `` are of the same sex '' , has to be read and understood in the same way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	454	I do not see how , on the ordinary methods of interpretation , the words `` male '' and `` female '' in section 11 -LRB- c -RRB- of the 1973 Act can be interpreted as including female to male and male to female transsexuals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	455	65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	456	What then are we to make , in this case , of the decision in Goodwin v United Kingdom -LRB- 2002 -RRB- 35 EHRR 18 ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	457	If it could be said that the use of the words `` male '' and `` female '' in section 11 -LRB- c -RRB- of the 1973 Act was ambiguous , it would have been possible to have regard to that decision in seeking to resolve the ambiguity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	458	But , for the reasons which I have given , I do not think that there is any such ambiguity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	459	Then there is section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Human Rights Act 1998 , which places a duty on the courts to read and give effect to legislation in a way that is compatible with the Convention rights if it is possible to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	460	But we are being asked in this case to make a declaration about the validity of a marriage ceremony which was entered into on 2 May 1981 , and section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1998 Act is not retrospective : R v Lambert -LSB- 2001 -RSB- UKHL 37 , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 AC 545 ; R v Kansal -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- UKHL 62 ; -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 AC 69 ; R v Lyons -LSB- 2002 -RSB- UKHL 44 ; -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 3 WLR 1562 , 1580D , para 45 per Lord Hoffmann and 1586B-C , para 63 per Lord Hutton . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	461	The interpretative obligation which section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- provides is not available . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	462	66 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	463	But I do not think that it would be right to leave the issue there . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	464	If , as I would hold , the 1981 ceremony can not be held to be a valid marriage ceremony , that is not an end of the matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	465	It would be open to Mrs Bellinger to try again some other day . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	466	It must be emphasised that this is not what she wants to do , as she regards herself as having been happily married since 1981 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	467	But we have been asked to say whether the provisions of section 11 -LRB- c -RRB- are incompatible with her Convention rights and , if we find that they are incompatible , to make a declaration of incompatibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	468	I agree that it is proper that we should undertake this exercise , although neither of these steps can have any effect on the validity or otherwise of the 1981 ceremony . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	469	67 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	470	We can not proceed to the making of a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Human Rights Act 1998 without examining the question which section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act treats as the logically prior question , which is whether the legislation can be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	471	As Lord Steyn put it in R v A -LRB- No 2 -RRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- UKHL 25 ; -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 AC 45 , 68D-E , para 44 , a declaration of incompatibility is a measure of last resort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	472	But the word `` must '' which section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- uses is qualified by the phrase `` so far as it is possible to do so '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	473	As I said in R v Lambert -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 AC 545 , 585B-D , para 79 , the obligation , powerful though it is , is not to be performed without regard to its limitations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	474	The obligation applies to the interpretation of legislation , which is the judges ' function . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	475	It does not give them power to legislate : see also In re S -LRB- Minors -RRB- -LRB- Care Order : Implementation of Care Plan -RRB- -LSB- 2002 -RSB- UKHL 10 ; -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 2 WLR 720 , 731B-E , paras 38-39 , per Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	476	68 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	477	If the only problem of interpretation had been one of timing , on the view that section 11 -LRB- c -RRB- regards `` male '' and `` female '' as something that can not be changed after birth whereas other provisions in the same section such as section 11 -LRB- b -RRB- relate to the position at the time the marriage is entered into , I would have been prepared to read the words `` at the time of the marriage '' in to section 11 -LRB- c -RRB- so as to give that provision a meaning which was compatible with the article 12 Convention right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	478	If the only obstacle was that the parties ' sex at the time when they were born had been assumed wrongly to be immutable , it could be overcome by disregarding the niceties of language and finding a compatible construction by reading these words in . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	479	But that would only have solved the problem for the future if it could indeed be said that Mrs Bellinger had completely changed her sex since birth and that she was now female . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	480	That , for the reasons I have sought to explain , is not a possible view of the facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	481	69 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	482	Her problem would be solved if it were possible for a transsexual to marry a person of the same sex , which is indeed what the European Court of Human Rights has now held should be the position in Goodwin . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	483	The court noted in para 100 of its judgment that article 9 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union had departed `` no doubt deliberately '' from the wording of article 12 of the Convention in removing the reference to `` men and women of marriageable age . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	484	Article 9 of the Charter states simply that `` the right to marry '' shall be guaranteed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	485	The note to article 9 says that it neither prohibits nor imposes the granting of the status of marriage to unions between people of the same sex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	486	It appears that the European Court saw that article as opening up the possibility of transsexuals marrying persons of the opposite sex to their post-operative acquired gender , as it rendered arguments about whether they were in act of the opposite sex irrelevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	487	By this route , which bypasses the physical problems which are inherent in the notion of a complete sex change , legal recognition can be given to the acquired gender of post-operative transsexuals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	488	But it is quite impossible to hold that section 11 -LRB- c -RRB- of the 1973 Act treats the sex of the parties to a marriage ceremony as irrelevant , as it makes express provision to the contrary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	489	In any event , problems of great complexity would be involved if recognition were to be given to same sex marriages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	490	They must be left to Parliament . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	491	I do not think that your Lordships can solve the problem judicially by means of the interpretative obligation in section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1998 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

69	496	LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	497	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	498	71 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	499	I agree with my noble and learned friends Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Hope of Craighead that the appeal should be dismissed but that a declaration of incompatibility should now be made under s. 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998 . 	lord hobhouse	lord nicholls	fullagr	0.8	NAN

69	499	I agree with my noble and learned friends Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Hope of Craighead that the appeal should be dismissed but that a declaration of incompatibility should now be made under s. 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998 . 	lord hobhouse	self	outcome	0.8	NAN
69	500	72 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	501	The parties went through a ceremony of civil marriage before a registrar of marriages under the Marriage Act 1949 on 2nd May 1981 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	502	At that date the Act which governed the legal validity of a purported marriage under English law was s. 11 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 : `` A marriage celebrated after 31st July 1971 shall be void on the following grounds only , that is to say - ... -LRB- c -RRB- that the parties are not respectively male and female ; ... '' The appellant gave her name to the Registrar of Marriages as Elizabeth Ann Wilkinson describing herself as a `` spinster '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	503	Like your Lordships I will use the words ` she ' or ` her ' in relation to the appellant without begging the question in issue whether she was in truth female at the time she married Mr Bellinger in 1981 . 	lord hobhouse	all	partagr	0.8	NAN
69	504	73 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	505	At that date and , indeed , until the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Goodwin -LRB- 28957/95 -RRB- , -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 35 EHRR 18 , it was the authoritative view that a refusal by domestic law to recognise ` transsexual ' marriages -LRB- a term to which I will have to revert -RRB- did not contravene Article 12 of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	506	The judgment in Goodwin expressly recognised that this had been the result of the earlier cases of Rees , Cossey , and Sheffield and Horsham : see paragraphs 73-75 and 97-104 of the judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	507	Until the delivery of the Goodwin judgment the appellant would have had no basis for any attack upon propriety of s. 11 of the 1973 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	508	74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	509	The judgment in Goodwin is , if I may say so , thoughtful and appreciates the complexity of the problems created for many aspects of the law by a novel recognition of the concept of a voluntary change of gender . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	510	The new approach may reflect new social attitudes to questions of sexuality but the more specific changes in society and the law which should follow from the recognition of the new attitudes are much more difficult to evaluate and provide for . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
69	511	For example , in the present context , to what extent do you change the fundamental concept of marriage ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	512	What new criteria do you apply ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	513	Once you make this change , how do you , in a non-discriminatory way , deal with mere cohabitees or with homosexuals of the same gender ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	514	The judgment refers in paragraph 91 and the preceding paragraphs to the report of the UK Interdepartmental Working Group -LRB- April 2000 -RRB- and the very substantial difficulties which it identified but also pointed out that they were not considered to be insuperable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	515	The Court also observed in paragraph 103 that `` though there is widespread acceptance of the marriage of transsexuals , fewer countries permit the marriage of transsexuals in their assigned gender than recognise the change of gender itself '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	516	However the Court concluded that there had been a breach of , inter alia , Article 12 because , although the Member States must be given a reasonable opportunity to decide how to revise their national legislation and make the appropriate changes , there came a time when the United Kingdom 's continued failure to do so amounted to a denial of the right to marry protected by Article 12 : see paragraphs 52 , 53 , 102-4 , and 120 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	517	75 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	518	The present case concerns a ` transsexual ' , that is to say , someone who wishes to change her existing gender and assume the opposite gender . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	519	This case is not concerned with gender mis-assignment nor with mixed or ` intersex ' gender . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	520	The appellant was born a male with all the characteristics of a male . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	521	She was correctly assigned the male gender at birth and in her birth certificate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	522	In 1967/8 , when 21 , she married a woman . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	523	-LRB- She did not disclose this fact to the registrar in 1981 . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	524	But the marriage was childless and did not last ; they were divorced in 1975 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	525	She assumed the female gender dressing and living as a woman . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	526	In February 1981 , following hormone treatment from a specialist , she underwent gender reassignment surgery as described by my noble and learned friend Lord Nicholls . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	527	This was irreversible in the sense that thereafter she could never be fully restored so as to be an anatomically complete male . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	528	76 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	529	Gender reassignment is an established medical procedure in various stages involving both diagnoses by the specialist and informed choices being made by the patient . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	530	There was uncontested expert evidence given about this at the trial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	531	Conveniently , it is also summarised in the judgment in Goodwin . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	532	The condition of dissatisfaction with one 's sexuality at a level justifying medical intervention is a medically recognised mental disorder -LRB- DSM-IV -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	533	It reflects a pathological degree of dissatisfaction with one 's existing gender . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	534	The specialist has to study the patient over a period of time and confirm the diagnosis and ascertain that the patient is definitely willing to take the next steps . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	535	Firstly the patient must become used to living as a member of the opposite sex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	536	Then the patient will be given courses of hormone treatment to change his/her hormonal make-up to that of the preferred sex . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	537	This reinforces the social changes already undertaken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	538	Finally various degrees of gender reassignment surgery are undertaken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	539	It is not until this last stage that the changes may become anatomically irreversible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	540	At any previous stage the patient may change his/her mind and decide that he/she does not want to make the change or not go any further . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	541	In the present case the appellant was steadfast in her intentions and went as far as she could , given the considerable limitations of gender reassignment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	542	But the question of transsexualism includes definitional questions of how far the person must go in order to qualify as a transsexual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	543	Is merely assuming the life and clothing of a woman enough or must it include irreversible gender reassignment ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	544	Or something in between ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	545	There are cogent arguments against adopting any specific criterion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	546	A further question which arises is referred to in paragraph 50 of the Goodwin judgment , noting : `` Many people revert to their biological sex after living for some time in the opposite sex and some alternate between the two sexes throughout their lives . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	547	All this underlines the novelty of the idea of gender by choice and how great a departure it represents from the pre-Goodwin human rights law and the previous understanding of what the words `` respectively male and female '' meant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	548	Similar fundamental novelties and changes in the use of language , culturally controversial , are involved in giving effect to the ECtHR 's interpretation of the word `` marry '' in Article 12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	549	77 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	550	The appellant 's primary claim was for a declaration under s. 55 of the Family Law Act 1986 that her marriage to Mr Bellinger in 1981 was `` at its inception a valid marriage '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	551	For the reasons given by my noble and learned friends and for the additional reasons I have given and those to be given by my noble and learned friend Lord Rodger of Earlsferry , the claim must fail and the appeal be dismissed . 	lord hobhouse	all	fullagr	0.9	NAN
69	551	For the reasons given by my noble and learned friends and for the additional reasons I have given and those to be given by my noble and learned friend Lord Rodger of Earlsferry , the claim must fail and the appeal be dismissed . 	lord hobhouse	self	outcome	0.9	NAN
69	552	The 1981 wedding was not valid . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	553	78 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	554	But that still leaves the question whether the House should make a declaration of incompatibility under s. 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	555	The threshold question is whether , by applying s. 3 , it is possible , as a matter of interpretation , to ` read down ' s. 11 -LRB- c -RRB- of the 1973 Act so as to include additional words such as `` or two people of the same sex one of whom has changed his/her sex to that of the opposite sex '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	556	This would in my view not be an exercise in interpretation however robust . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	557	It would be a legislative exercise of amendment making a legislative choice as to what precise amendment was appropriate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	558	Counsel for the Lord Chancellor on behalf of the Government did not argue otherwise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	559	Counsel also did not argue that Goodwin was wrongly decided nor that the UK was not under a treaty obligation to comply with it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	560	But , effectively repeating arguments made unsuccessfully in Strasbourg , submitted that the House should not exercise its discretion under s. 4 having regard to the difficulty of deciding upon new policies and drafting new legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	561	These difficulties exist but much time has elapsed ; the Working Group reported in April 2000 ; the Court of Appeal commented as strongly as it was proper for them to do so at the lack of progress in July 2001 and the ECtHR has made its decision in Goodwin on the basis that the permitted time for compliance has expired . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	562	The argument for further time is now itself incompatible with the rights conferred by the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	563	79 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	564	But counsel also argued that , in view of his concession that Goodwin bound the United Kingdom , any declaration would be academic and its purpose was merely to confer a power to expedite legislation under s. 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	565	These arguments must be rejected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	566	The Appellant and Mr Bellinger in exercise of their rights under Article 12 would wish to enter into a valid marriage as soon as the UK legislation enables them to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	567	Others may wish to do the same . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	568	The Government can not yet give any assurance about the introduction of compliant legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	569	There will be political costs in both the drafting and enactment of new legislation and the legislative time it will occupy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
69	570	The incompatibility having been established , the declaration under s. 4 should be made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

69	585	I add a point about the language of the relevant legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
69	586	82 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
69	587	The submissions for Mrs Bellinger presuppose that , in relation to marriage , English law envisages that a person 's gender can alter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
69	588	The form of section 11 -LRB- c -RRB- of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 indicates that this is not so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
69	589	83 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
69	590	Section 11 -LRB- c -RRB- is a re-enactment of section 1 -LRB- c -RRB- of the Nullity of Marriage Act 1971 which was passed shortly after the decision in Corbett v Corbett -LSB- 1971 -RSB- P 83 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
69	591	Section 11 -LRB- c -RRB- contains one in a series of grounds of nullity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
69	592	By section 11 -LRB- b -RRB- a marriage is void if `` at the time of the marriage either party was already lawfully married '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
69	593	The reference to the situation at the time of the marriage is necessary because a person may have been lawfully married at an earlier time and may be lawfully married at a later time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
69	594	The situation is one that can change . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
69	595	For purposes of nullity the critical consideration is what the situation was `` at the time of the marriage '' in question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
69	596	Similarly , section 11 -LRB- d -RRB- provides that a polygamous marriage entered into outside England and Wales is void if `` either party was at the time of the marriage domiciled in England and Wales '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
69	597	Again , when dealing with domicile which can change , Parliament uses the past tense and specifies the time of the marriage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
69	598	Section 11 -LRB- c -RRB- is different in both respects : a marriage is void if `` the parties are not respectively male and female '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
69	599	Both the present tense and the omission of any reference to the time of the marriage indicate that , in relation to the validity of marriage , Parliament regards gender as fixed and immutable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
