60	12	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
60	13	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
60	14	The issue in this appeal is whether the disability appeal tribunal made an error of law in deciding on 27 January 1999 that the appellant , Mrs Munira Moyna , did not qualify for disability living allowance under section 72 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- -LRB- ii -RRB- of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
60	15	Mrs Moyna 's condition subsequently deteriorated and she made a fresh claim which was allowed with effect from 14 June 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
60	16	This appeal is concerned with whether it should have been paid before that date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
60	17	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
60	18	The Social Security Commissioner , to whom in the first instance an appeal from the tribunal lay under section 34 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 , decided that there had been no error of law but his decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal -LRB- Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss P , Potter and Kay LJJ -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
60	19	The functions of the disability appeal tribunal have since been transferred by section 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Social Security Act 1998 to unified appeal tribunals constituted under that Act but the appeal to the commissioner -LRB- section 14 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- and thence to the Court of Appeal -LRB- section 15 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- is still only on points of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
60	20	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
60	21	Disability living allowance was introduced by the Disability Living Allowance and Disability Working Allowance Act 1991 to replace what had been called attendance allowance and mobility allowance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
60	22	The qualifications for attendance allowance had required a severe degree of disablement : the applicant had to be so severely disabled physically or mentally that he required `` frequent attention throughout the day '' or `` prolonged or repeated attention during the night '' in connection with his `` bodily functions '' or `` continual supervision '' throughout the day or night in order to avoid substantial danger to himself or others . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
60	23	Although the courts were willing to give `` bodily functions '' a fairly wide meaning -LRB- see for example Mallinson v Secretary of State for Social Security -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 WLR 630 -RRB- the House of Lords decided in In re Woodling -LSB- 1984 -RSB- 1 WLR 348 that it did not include the performance of domestic tasks like cooking . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
60	24	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
60	25	One purpose of the new benefit introduced by the 1991 Act was to enable persons with lesser degrees of disability to qualify for allowances at lower rates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
60	26	In provisions which are now consolidated in section 72 of the 1992 Act , it provided for payment of the `` care component '' of the allowance at three different levels . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
60	27	The present case is concerned with the lowest level , to which a person is entitled under section 72 -LRB- 1 -RRB- : '' ... for any period throughout which ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
60	28	-LRB- a -RRB- he is so severely disabled physically or mentally that ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
60	29	-LRB- ii -RRB- he can not prepare a cooked main meal for himself if he has the ingredients '' 7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
60	30	Paragraphs -LRB- b -RRB- and -LRB- c -RRB- of section 72 -LRB- 1 -RRB- prescribe the conditions for payment of allowances at the two higher levels . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
60	31	In order to ensure that the allowance is paid only for more or less chronic disabilities , subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- provides that : '' ... a person shall not be entitled to the care component of a disability living allowance unless ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
60	32	-LRB- a -RRB- throughout ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
60	33	-LRB- i -RRB- the period of 3 months immediately preceding the date on which the award of that care component would begin ... he has satisfied or is likely to satisfy one or other of the conditions mentioned in subsection 1 -LRB- a -RRB- to -LRB- c -RRB- above ; and -LRB- b -RRB- he is likely to continue to satisfy one or other of those conditions throughout ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
60	34	-LRB- i -RRB- the period of 6 months beginning with that date ... '' 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
60	35	Mrs Moyna was for 21 years a civil servant in the -LRB- then -RRB- Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food who retired in 1997 , aged 58 , on grounds of ill health . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
60	36	She has a number of illnesses and disabilities , including a heart condition which prevents her from exerting herself for any length of time without bringing on pain and discomfort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
60	37	On 20 December 1996 she applied for disability living allowance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
60	38	There is -LRB- or was -RRB- a comprehensive form for such applications called DLA 1 , which includes a section on `` Help that you need during the day - preparing a cooked main meal for yourself '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
60	39	The form said : `` You may never have planned or prepared a cooked main meal for yourself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
60	40	But try to imagine how much help you would need if you tried to do this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
60	41	If you had everything you needed for the meal , roughly how many days a week would you need help planning a cooked main meal ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
60	42	peeling and chopping vegetables ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
60	43	using cooking utensils ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
60	44	using taps ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
60	45	using a cooker ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
60	46	coping with hot pans ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
60	47	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
60	48	The boxes to be ticked on the form offered the alternatives of No help needed , 1 to 3 days , 4 to 5 days and 6 to 7 days . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
60	49	Mrs Moyna ticked the 1 to 3 days boxes for help with cooking utensils , taps and hot pans . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
60	50	By way of explanation , she added in the space provided : `` If pans are heavy , I need someone to carry them and put them on cooker or away . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
60	51	I can not carry anything heavy as if I do it brings on angina attacks . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
60	52	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
60	53	Mrs Moyna was then visited by an examining medical practitioner , who had his own form to fill in . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
60	54	This starts with a statement of the `` disabled person 's needs in their own words '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
60	55	Under the heading `` Preparing a cooked Meal '' , the doctor wrote `` Can prepare a cooked meal '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
60	56	In the section for the doctor 's own opinions , under the heading `` Need for attention : in your opinion can the disabled person safely ... '' , followed by a list of actions , he ticked `` Without someone 's help '' in respect of peeling and chopping vegetables , using taps , using a cooker and coping with hot pans . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
60	57	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
60	58	The application form and the medical report then went to an adjudication officer , Mrs Roberts , who on 4 February 1997 disallowed the claim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
60	59	Mrs Moyna wrote on 13 February 1997 requesting a review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
60	60	The case was reconsidered by another adjudication officer , who reaffirmed the decision : `` I accept the visiting doctor 's opinion as it is based on the examination and observation of Mrs Moyna . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
60	61	The cooked main meal is for one person only , therefore I consider that she could manage the pans for cooking such a meal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
60	62	I do not accept that she can not prepare a cooked main meal for herself . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
60	63	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
60	64	In her more detailed reasons , the adjudication officer said : `` In her claim pack , Mrs Moyna states that she needs help 1-3 days a week , to use cooking utensils and taps and to cope with hot pans . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
60	65	She can not carry anything heavy as it brings on angina attacks . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
60	66	In her statement to the visiting doctor , she states she can prepare a cooked meal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
60	67	The visiting doctor 's opinion is that she does not require help to prepare a cooked main meal . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
60	68	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
60	69	Mrs Moyna then appealed to the disability appeal tribunal , which dismissed her appeal on 27 January 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
60	70	She told the tribunal that she could cook , although `` nothing elaborate '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
60	71	The tribunal concluded : `` Chopping and peeling is sometimes difficult - and always is with hard vegetables if they are large . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
60	72	She can manage a small saucepan for herself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
60	73	The other difficulty is standing for a long time and the appellant 's tactic if she has to cook something for herself is to put it on the cooker then lie down . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
60	74	From this we concluded that , with some planning and careful arranging of cooking requisites and perhaps use of a high chair , appellant can , on most days , prepare a cooked main meal for herself , and that it is not unreasonable to expect her to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
60	75	She therefore does not qualify for the care component on that basis . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
60	76	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
60	77	Mrs Moyna then appealed to the commissioner , saying that the tribunal has misconstrued the requirements of section 72 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- -LRB- ii -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
60	78	The commissioner found no error of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
60	79	The test , he said , is whether the claimant can cook a `` labour intensive reasonable main daily meal freshly cooked on a traditional cooker '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
60	80	Not all tribunals might have reached the same conclusion but the tribunal was entitled on the evidence to reach the conclusion it did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
60	81	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
60	82	In the Court of Appeal the leading judgment was given by Kay LJ and the other two members of the court agreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
60	83	He did not accept that one could have facts on which different tribunals could properly reach different conclusions about whether the `` cooking test '' had been satisfied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
60	84	The test was intended to be `` straightforward '' and produce the same answer on the same facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
60	85	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
60	86	Kay LJ said that the provision of a cooked main meal was something required `` not on an occasional basis but on a regular basis if someone is to enjoy a reasonable quality of life '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
60	87	If the inability to cook was on `` no more than occasional days '' , the test would not be satisfied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
60	88	But if there was a `` clear pattern '' of a person not being able to provide for himself , it would . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
60	89	In the present case , there was such a clear pattern , because on basis of Mrs Moyna 's answers on the claim form , there would sometimes be weeks in which for three days she would `` have to forgo her one cooked meal '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
60	90	This was a `` significant '' disability because there was a regular pattern rather than something `` occasional or intermittent '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
60	91	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
60	92	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
60	93	there are two points to be made about the `` cooking test '' in section 72 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- -LRB- ii -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
60	94	The first is that its purpose is not to ascertain whether the applicant can survive , or enjoy a reasonable diet , without assistance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
60	95	It is a notional test , a thought-experiment , to calibrate the severity of the disability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
60	96	It does not matter whether the applicant actually needs to cook . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
60	97	As the form DLA 1 said , `` try to imagine how much help you would need if you tried to do this . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
60	98	No doubt some people -LRB- disabled or otherwise -RRB- do need to cook or prefer to do so , although home cooking seems to be fighting a losing battle against convenience foods and ready-cooked meals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
60	99	Not for nothing is the notional meal contemplated by the cooking test described in the authorities as `` traditional '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
60	100	It must be remembered that disability living allowance is a non-contributory , non-means tested benefit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
60	101	A person who can not cook for himself is entitled to the allowance , now # 14.90 a week , whether he solves the eating problem by obtaining help , having a wife , buying television dinners or dining at the Savoy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
60	102	On the other hand , even if a person needs to cook and has the motor skills to do so , he may still need assistance ; to obtain the ingredients which the test assumes him to have , or because he is culinarily incompetent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
60	103	So in my view the Court of Appeal was wrong to lay such emphasis upon the fact that unless the applicant could cook more or less every day , she would not enjoy a reasonable quality of life . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
60	104	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
60	105	That leads on to the second point , which is that the test says nothing about how often the person should be able to cook . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
60	106	It would have been easy for Parliament to say that a person should be able to cook daily or six times a week or whatever . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
60	107	Instead , the statute approaches the question of frequency in a different way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
60	108	Section 72 -LRB- 2 -RRB- contemplates that one should be able to say of someone throughout a nine month period that he is a person whose disability is such that he can not cook a main meal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
60	109	What does this mean ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
60	110	One possible construction is that if there was a single occasion during the period when a remission in his disability would have allowed him to cook a meal , it can not be said that throughout the period he was unable to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
60	111	But the Secretary of State does not contend for this construction and I do not think that it would be right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
60	112	That is not because one occasion is de minimis but because the test does not in my opinion function at that day to day level . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
60	113	It involves looking at the whole period and saying whether , in a more general sense , the person can fairly be described as a person who is unable to cook a meal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
60	114	It is an exercise in judgment rather than an arithmetical calculation of frequency . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
60	115	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
60	116	I therefore agree with the commissioner that the question involves taking `` a broad view of the matter '' and making a judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
60	117	The standard of motor abilities required by the cooking test is not so precise as to allow calibration by arithmetical formula . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
60	118	In the present case , I think that the Court of Appeal attached too much weight to the fact that in her claim form Mrs Moyna had ticked the box `` 1-3 days '' for the extent to which she needed help with heavy pans , cutting vegetables and so forth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
60	119	In answering the generalised question of whether Mrs Moyna could fairly be described as a person unable to cook , it may be relevant to consider not only the number of occasions on which she says she would need assistance but also the reasons why it would be needed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
60	120	The tribunal went into the matter in some detail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
60	121	It observed that she could cook for herself using lighter pans and cutting up smaller vegetables . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
60	122	In addition , it had the opinion of the examining doctor and his record of Mrs Moyna 's own description of herself as a person who could cook a meal - a description which is , as I have said , not inconsistent with her not being able to do so all the time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
60	123	These are all items of evidence which go into the decision-making process . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
60	124	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
60	125	In any case in which a tribunal has to apply a standard with a greater or lesser degree of imprecision and to take a number of factors into account , there are bound to be cases in which it will be impossible for a reviewing court to say that the tribunal must have erred in law in deciding the case either way : see George Mitchell -LRB- Chesterhall -RRB- Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd -LSB- 1983 -RSB- 2 AC 803 , 815-816 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
60	126	I respectfully think that it was unrealistic of Kay LJ to think that he was able to sharpen the test to produce only one right answer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
60	127	In my opinion the commissioner was right to say that whether or not he would have arrived at the same conclusion , the decision of the tribunal disclosed no error of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
60	128	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
60	129	That is sufficient to dispose of the appeal , but I must say something about an alternative submission by Mr Paines , who appeared for the Secretary of State . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
60	130	He said the words `` period throughout which he is so severely disabled physically or mentally that ... he can not prepare a cooked main meal for himself '' were ordinary English words and that their meaning was not a question of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
60	131	Consequently the short answer to the appeal was that the decision of the tribunal raised no point of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
60	132	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
60	133	This submission was based upon some well known remarks of Lord Reid in Brutus v Cozens -LSB- 1973 -RSB- AC 854 , 861 , in which the question was whether the appellant had been guilty of `` insulting behaviour '' : `` The meaning of an ordinary word of the English language is not a question of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
60	134	The proper construction of a statute is a question of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
60	135	If the context shows that a word is used in an unusual sense the court will determine in other words what that unusual sense is . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
60	136	But here there is in my opinion no question of the word ` insulting ' being used in any unusual sense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
60	137	It appears to me , for reasons which I shall give later , to be intended to have its ordinary meaning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
60	138	It is for the tribunal which decides the case to consider , not as law but as fact , whether in the whole circumstances the words of the statute do or do not as a matter of ordinary usage of the English language cover or apply to the facts which have been proved . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
60	139	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
60	140	I think that these observations have been given a much wider meaning than the author intended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
60	141	Lord Reid was in my opinion making two very pertinent points . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
60	142	First , he was drawing attention to a feature of language ; namely , that many words or phrases are linguistically irreducible in the sense that any attempt to elucidate a sentence by replacing them with synonyms will change rather than explain its meaning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
60	143	Lord Kilbrandon made the same point in his reference to Dr Johnson at p. 867 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
60	144	On the other hand , Lord Reid insisted that , whether the statute used simple words or difficult ones , its construction was a question of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
60	145	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
60	146	Lord Reid was here making the well-known distinction between the meaning of a word , which depends upon conventions known to the ordinary speaker of English or ascertainable from a dictionary , and the meaning which the author of an utterance appears to have intended to convey by using that word in a sentence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
60	147	The latter depends not only upon the conventional meanings of the words used but also upon syntax , context and background . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
60	148	The meaning of an English word is not a question of law because it does not in itself have any legal significance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
60	149	It is the meaning to be ascribed to the intention of the notional legislator in using that word which is a statement of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
60	150	It is because of the nature of language that , in trying to ascertain the legislator 's meaning , it is seldom helpful to make additions or substitutions in the actual language he has used . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
60	151	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
60	152	Lord Reid 's second point is made in the last sentence of the passage I have quoted , when he says that the question of whether the facts found by the tribunal count as `` insulting '' for the purposes of the statute is a question of fact . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
60	153	There is a good deal of high authority for saying that the question of whether the facts as found or admitted fall one side or the other of some conceptual line drawn by the law is a question of fact : see , for example , Edwards v Bairstow -LSB- 1956 -RSB- AC 14 and O'Kelly v Trusthouse Forte plc -LSB- 1984 -RSB- QB 90 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
60	154	What this means in practice is that an appellate court with jurisdiction to entertain appeals only on questions of law will not hear an appeal against such a decision unless it falls outside the bounds of reasonable judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
60	155	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
60	156	It may seem rather odd to say that something is a question of fact when there is no dispute whatever over the facts and the question is whether they fall within some legal category . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
60	157	In his classic work on Trial by Jury Lord Devlin said -LRB- at p 61 -RRB- : `` The questions of law which are for the judge fall into two categories : first , there are questions which can not be correctly answered except by someone who is skilled in the law ; secondly , there are questions of fact which lawyers have decided that judges can answer better than juries .

60	159	Likewise it may be said that there are two kinds of questions of fact : there are questions of fact ; and there are questions of law as to which lawyers have decided that it would be inexpedient for an appellate tribunal to have to form an independent judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
60	160	But the usage is well established and causes no difficulty as long as it is understood that the degree to which an appellate court will be willing to substitute its own judgment for that of the tribunal will vary with the nature of the question : see In re Grayan Building Services Ltd -LSB- 1995 -RSB- Ch 241 , 254-255 .

60	162	Applying the first of these two points to the facts of the present case , I think that it was unhelpful for the Court of Appeal to construe the statutory language as if it included words like `` daily '' or `` regularly '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
60	163	Applying the second , I think that the decision of the tribunal was within the bounds of reasonable judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
60	164	I therefore think that , properly understood , Lord Reid 's remarks in Brutus v Cozens -LSB- 1973 -RSB- AC 854 , 861 do not lay down some heterodox principle which provides a short cut to dismissing an appeal -LRB- `` the last resort of counsel appearing on behalf of respondents '' as Lord Woolf MR said in R v Radio Authority , Ex p Bull -LSB- 1998 -RSB- QB 294 , 304 -RRB- but are in accordance with established principles and common sense .
