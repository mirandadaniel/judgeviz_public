55	11	I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough . 	lord hope	lord hobhouse	ackn	0	lord hobhouse

55	13	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hobhouse
55	14	As my noble and learned friend has explained , Mr Sage 's primary argument at first instance was that the building was an agricultural building for which he did not need planning permission . 	lord hope	lord hobhouse	partagr	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	15	This was a pure question of fact , and it was resolved against him conclusively by the inspector 's finding that the building was not an agricultural building but was best described as a dwelling house that was in the course of construction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	16	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	17	This led to the alternative argument that the notice was out of time because the operations that must be substantially completed for the purpose of section 171B -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 comprise the operations which constituted a breach of planning control , or -LRB- as it was put -RRB- the operational development , and not the whole operation of completing the dwelling house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	18	The inspector 's view was that the four year period did not begin until the whole operation of creating the dwelling house was substantially completed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	19	He then held , treating the question as one of fact and degree , that the building in this case was not a substantially completed dwelling house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	20	Here again the inspector 's decision on the facts went against Mr Sage and the contrary is not longer arguable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	21	The question which remains is whether the inspector was right when he said that the four year period did not begin until the whole operation of creating the dwelling house was substantially completed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	22	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	23	Mr Sage 's argument is that the reference in section 171B -LRB- 1 -RRB- to the date `` on which the operations are substantially completed '' has to be read in the light of the wording of the other relevant sections in the 1990 Act , and that by tracing the language of that subsection back through section 171A -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- the reader is required to bring into account the definition of `` development '' in section 55 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Act , those operations which section 55 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- says are not to be taken to involve development and the definition of the word `` building '' in section 336 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	24	If this approach is right the position is , as Keene LJ explained in paras 27 -31 of his judgment , capable of being resolved quite simply by saying that what have to be substantially completed are those operations which amount to a breach of planning control and that operations and works which do not amount to development because they fall within section 55 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- are not to be taken into account . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	25	On this approach , it does not matter that the inspector did not think that the building was a dwelling house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	26	All one needs to find is that there is a building which has been erected in breach of planning control . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	27	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	28	I was initially attracted to this approach , as it seemed to me to be consistent with the language of the statute and to be unlikely , as Keene LJ said in para 32 of the judgment , to give rise to practical difficulties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	29	But I have in the end been persuaded , with respect , that the language of the statute is open to a different interpretation and that it makes better sense of the legislation as a whole to adopt the holistic approach which my noble and learned friend has described . 	lord hope	lord hobhouse	partagr	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	30	What this means , in short , is that regard should be had to the totality of the operations which the person originally contemplated and intended to carry out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	31	That will be an easy task if the developer has applied for and obtained planning permission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	32	It will be less easy where , as here , planning permission was not applied for at all . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	33	In such a case evidence as to what was intended may have to be gathered from various sources , having regard especially to the building 's physical features and its design . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	34	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	35	If it is shown that all the developer intended to do was to erect a folly , such as a building which looks from a distance like a complete building - a mock temple or a make-believe fort , for example - but was always meant to be incomplete , then one must take the building when he has finished with it as it stands . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	36	It would be wrong to treat it as having a character which the person who erected it never intended it to have . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	37	But if it is shown that he has stopped short of what he contemplated and intended when he began the development , the building as it stands can properly be treated as an uncompleted building against which the four year period has not yet begun to run . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	38	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	39	It must be emphasised that it is not for the inspector to substitute his own view as to what a building is intended to be for that which was intended by the developer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse
55	40	But that was not what the inspector did in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	41	It was not just that the building looked to him like a dwelling house that was in course of construction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	42	His conclusion was supported , in his view , by an application which Mr Sage had made in 1994 to use the building for tourist accommodation and by his finding that that remained Mr Sage 's stated intention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	43	These matters were relevant to the question which he had to decide , and in my opinion he was entitled on the facts which he found to reach the conclusion which he did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	44	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	45	LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	46	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	47	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	48	On 19th March 1999 , the Maidstone Borough Council -LRB- the Council -RRB- as the relevant planning authority issued and served on Mr Sage an enforcement notice -LRB- the Notice -RRB- under Part VII of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 -LRB- the Act -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	49	The Notice informed him that the Council considered that he was in breach of planning control in erecting -LRB- or , as later amended , partially erecting -RRB- a dwelling house and requiring its removal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	50	Mr Sage appealed raising various grounds under s. 174 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	51	Besides applying for planning permission ex post facto , the two main grounds of his appeal were firstly that the building was an agricultural building and did not require planning permission and , secondly , that the notice had been served outside the four year time limit permitted by s. 171B -LRB- 1 -RRB- , a section inserted into the Act by the Planning and Compensation Act 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	52	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	53	Section 171B -LRB- 1 -RRB- provides : '' Where there has been a breach of planning control consisting in the carrying out without planning permission of building , engineering , mining or other operations in , on , over or under land , no enforcement action may be taken after the end of the period of four years beginning with the date on which the operations were substantially completed . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	54	This provision followed the lead given by Mr Robert Carnwarth QC in his Report to the Secretary of State for the Environment -LRB- Enforcing Planning Control : February 1989 -RRB- which called for greater simplicity and clarity in the law and procedures of enforcement which had become excessively technical and complex and open to evasion and abuse . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	55	There can be no doubt that the underlying purpose behind s. 171B -LRB- 1 -RRB- was to introduce a single easily applied limitation period for operations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	56	Section 171B -LRB- 2 -RRB- and -LRB- 3 -RRB- adopted in respect of change of use and other breaches four and ten year periods respectively , running in either case from the date of the breach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	57	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	58	The point raised by this appeal by the Council to your Lordships ' House concerns the construction of s. 171B -LRB- 1 -RRB- and the starting point of the four year period - ie `` the date on which the operations were substantially completed '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	59	Mr Sage contends that it means the date after which the building work remaining to be done would no longer itself involve a breach of planning control , because , if taken on its own , it would not require planning permission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	60	The judge , Deputy Judge Ouseley QC , and the Court of Appeal summarised the point in a brief sentence : '' The building operations are complete when those activities which require planning permission are complete . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	61	The Council on the other hand argue for a holistic construction , asking : has the building been substantially completed and , if so , when ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	62	The Council , like the inspector , adopt the passage in the Ministry Circular No. 10/97 , paragraph 280 . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	63	... in the case of a single operation , such as the building of a house , the four-year period does not begin until the whole operation is substantially complete . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	64	What is substantially complete must always be decided as a matter of fact and degree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	65	... All the relevant circumstances must be considered in every case . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	66	The inspector , deciding in favour of the Council and upholding the Notice , applied the latter approach ; the judge and the Court of Appeal -LRB- Schiemann LJ , Keene LJ and Sir Murray Stuart-Smith -RRB- , deciding in favour of Mr Sage , preferred the former . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse
55	67	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	68	The inspector heard Mr Sage 's appeal -LRB- together with two other appeals concerning the same parties -RRB- over the space of two days including a view of the relevant premises . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	69	Both parties were legally represented and adduced oral and written evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	70	It was accepted by the Council that Mr Sage had not done any further building work on the relevant structure during the last four years before the Notice was served . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	71	It was also common ground that it was an ` operation ' case falling within s. 171B -LRB- 1 -RRB- not a change of use case under subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	72	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	73	The inspector started by considering Mr Sage 's contention that it was an agricultural structure and therefore he had never needed any planning permission to erect it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	74	He considered how it was constructed and concluded that it was constructed with domestic not agricultural features , as a dwelling not as a building to be used for agricultural purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	75	It was constructed with cavity block walls . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	76	Three elevations were clad with tiles and the fourth with timber boarding -LRB- but the cladding was incomplete -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	77	The entrance door and the fenestration were typical of a dwelling designed and constructed for human habitation not agricultural use . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	78	The external tile hung walls in his view supported the same conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	79	The building had an upper floor with further fenestration though no stairway had been installed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	80	He applied the test of physical layout and appearance derived from Belmont Farm Ltd v MHLG -LRB- 1962 -RRB- 13 P&CR 417 and Mckay and Walker v Secretary of State for the Environment -LSB- 1989 -RSB- JPL 590 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	81	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	82	The inspector rightly did not investigate the intentions of Mr Sage at various stages in the history nor the uses he had made of the structure from time to time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	83	The character and purpose of a structure falls to be assessed by examining its physical and design features . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	84	The relevance of the assessment is to determine whether or not the building operation is one requiring planning permission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	85	The actual use made of the building does not alter the answer to be given . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	86	Keeping a pig in the sitting-room or hens in the kitchen does not turn a dwelling house into an agricultural building even if the humans move out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	87	Permission for a change of use may have to be applied for but that would be a separate question . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	88	The starting point for considering the permitted use of a new structure is the character of the building for which permission has been given or does not require to be given : s. 75 -LRB- 3 -RRB- - '' ... the permission shall be construed as including permission to use the building for the purpose for which it is designed . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	89	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	90	He expressed his conclusion in the words : '' As a matter of fact and degree , I consider that , having regard to its layout and appearance , -LSB- this building -RSB- is not an agricultural building and was not designed as such . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	91	... -LSB- It -RSB- is best described as a dwelling house that is in course of construction . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	92	Having read the evidence and considered the photographs which have been included in our papers , the inspector 's conclusion on this point would seem to have been inevitable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse
55	93	Therefore that ground of appeal failed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	94	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	95	This led on to Mr Sage 's further ground for challenging the Notice , that it was out of time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	96	The starting point is that the building is to be classified as an unfinished dwelling house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	97	It was unfit for habitation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	98	The floor at ground level consisted of rubble . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	99	There were no service fittings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	100	There was no staircase . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	101	The interior walls were unfinished , without lining or plaster . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	102	None of the windows , including that on the upper floor , was glazed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	103	One witness refers to the roof-light as being glazed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	104	There was no guttering . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	105	Mr Sage had said in evidence that the building had originally been glazed but that the glass had been broken by vandals more than four years earlier and he had not replaced it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	106	Mr Sage 's evidence was contradicted by other evidence which was inconsistent with the windows ever having been glazed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	107	It appears that the inspector probably did not accept Mr Sage 's evidence on this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	108	But it was not critical to the inspector 's decision nor to those of the judge and the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	109	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	110	On this state of the facts , the issue of the construction of s. 171B -LRB- 1 -RRB- became critical and was the effective subject matter of Mr Sage 's recourse to the jurisdiction of the High Court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	111	On the argument of Mr Sage , it was necessary to consider whether the work needed to complete the structure as a dwelling house was such as of itself to require planning permission , a point which Mr Sage submitted was at least arguable and had not been taken into account by the inspector in arriving at his decision and therefore -LRB- as the judge ordered -RRB- his decision should be quashed and he be directed to reconsider the appeal against the Notice having regard to that factor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	112	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	113	It is convenient to examine this argument at the outset although it is not the central point raised by this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	114	Section 57 -LRB- 1 -RRB- in Part III of the Act provides that -LRB- subject to immaterial exceptions -RRB- `` planning permission is required for any development of land '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	115	`` Development '' is defined in s. 55 as meaning - '' the carrying out of building , engineering , mining or other operations in , on , over or under land ... '' Subsection -LRB- 1A -RRB- , added in 1991 , amplifies this by providing that `` building operations '' shall include - '' -LRB- a -RRB- demolition of buildings ; -LRB- b -RRB- rebuilding ; -LRB- c -RRB- structural alterations of or additions to buildings ; and -LRB- d -RRB- other operations normally undertaken by a person carrying on business as a builder . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	116	Subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- is subject to subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- which so far as material provides - '' The following operations ... shall not be taken for the purposes of this Act to involve development of the land - -LRB- a -RRB- the carrying out for the maintenance , improvement or other alteration of any building of works which - -LRB- i -RRB- affect only the interior of the building , or -LRB- ii -RRB- do not materially affect the external appearance of the building ... '' Mr Sage submits that the work remaining to be done was all either internal work or work which did not materially affect the external appearance of the building . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	117	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	118	It would be a question of fact whether the external work still to be done would have had a material effect on the building 's appearance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	119	But that question would only become significant if the work was work carried out `` for the maintenance , improvement or other alteration '' of the building . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse
55	120	Work carried out by way of completing an incomplete structure would not come within exception -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	121	So , once it has to be accepted , in accordance with the inspector 's finding , that the structure was a dwelling house in the course of construction , it follows that the work would be properly described as work carried out in the course of completing the construction of the building . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	122	Exception -LRB- a -RRB- clearly contemplates and involves a completed building which is to be maintained , improved or altered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	123	It follows that an essential element in the argument of Mr Sage is missing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	124	He can not on the facts of this case rely upon exception -LRB- a -RRB- to say that he would not still require planning permission to complete the structure because it would not have amounted to a `` development '' -LRB- the premise upon which his argument under s. 171B is founded -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	125	The breach of planning control would not have been exhausted ; it would be continuing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	126	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	127	The Court of Appeal rejected this conclusion for two reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	128	Keene LJ -LRB- in paragraph 26 -RRB- said that so long as the structure had progressed to the stage where it could be said to have an interior , ie , as Mr Sage 's counsel put it , say 3 or 4 walls and a roof , exception -LRB- a -RRB- could be applied and the developer could potentially take advantage of it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	129	Schiemann LJ -LRB- in paragraph 37 -RRB- thought that the Council 's argument introduced a subjective element : '' I can see no policy reason why we should construe s. 55 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- as limited in its application to buildings which have been completed according to some notional plan . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	130	I do not accept either argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	131	It is not a question of referring to ` some notional plan ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	132	Ex hypothesi , the erection is an uncompleted dwelling house ; what is involved is its completion as a dwelling house by carrying out works essential for a completed dwelling house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	133	The approach of Keene LJ not only does violence to the language used in exception -LRB- a -RRB- but also would make a mockery of planning control by inviting abuse and evasion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	134	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	135	Returning now to s. 171B -LRB- 1 -RRB- , it can be seen that the same words have been used by the draftsman to describe building operations as in s. 55 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , inviting , it is said , the reader to read the two sections together . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	136	However it still does not equate the term ` operation ' with the term ` development ' as further appears from s. 191 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	137	But the more important part of Mr Sage 's argument is that such a cross-reference is required by the words : `` Where there has been a breach of planning control consisting in the carrying out without planning permission of building ... operations ... '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	138	The phrase `` the date on which the operations were substantially completed '' should , he submits , be answered by asking when did those operations reach the stage at which no further breach of planning control was involved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	139	He would then answer that question by reference to exception -LRB- a -RRB- in s. 55 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	140	Section 171A -LRB- 1 -RRB- provides that - '' For the purposes of this Act ... carrying out development without the required planning permission ... constitutes a breach of planning control '' He thus argued that the enforcement notice could only relate to breaches of planning control and that , once no further breach was involved in completing the development , there could be no further building operations to which an enforcement notice and s. 171B could apply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	141	Therefore the operations referred to in s. 171B must have been completed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	142	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	143	Again these arguments were accepted by the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	144	Keene LJ -LRB- at paragraph 31 -RRB- said : '' I conclude that , as a matter of law , operations and other works which do not amount to development are not to be taken into account in deciding whether there has been substantial completion within the meaning of s. 171B -LRB- 1 -RRB- .

55	145	As the deputy judge pointed out , where all the operations amounting to development have been carried out there is nothing remaining against which the local planning authority could take enforcement action . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse
55	146	Schiemann LJ added -LRB- at paragraph 38 -RRB- : '' I am presently inclined to the view -LRB- without the matter having been fully argued -RRB- that substantial completion has taken place when there is enough to enable a planning authority to judge whether or not the building has sufficient adverse effects to make it expedient to issue an enforcement notice . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	147	The section might have been drafted as Schiemann LJ prefers but it was not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	148	The criterion he suggests would fly in the face of the simplicity and clarity that the revisions of planning control law were seeking to achieve . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	149	As regards the reason given by Keene LJ and the judge , it involves giving a limited meaning to the phrase ` building operations ' , not its natural meaning , and does so on the basis of adopting an extended meaning to exception -LRB- a -RRB- which is open to the objections I have already referred to . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	150	But the most substantial objection to his approach is that it is contrary to the holistic approach upon which this part of planning law is based . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	151	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	152	When an application for planning consent is made for permission for a single operation , it is made in respect of the whole of the building operation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	153	There are two reasons for this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	154	The first is the practical one that an application for permission partially to erect a building would , save in exceptional circumstances , fail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	155	The second is that the concept of final permission requires a fully detailed building of a certain character , not a structure which is incomplete . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	156	This is one of the differences between an outline permission and a final permission : s. 92 of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	157	As counsel for Mr Sage accepted , if a building operation is not carried out , both externally and internally , fully in accordance with the permission , the whole operation is unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	158	She contrasted that with a case where the building has been completed but is then altered or improved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	159	This demonstrates the fallacy in Mr Sage 's case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	160	He comes into the first category not the second . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	161	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	162	The same holistic approach is implicit in the decisions on what an enforcement notice relating to a single operation may require . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	163	Where a lesser operation might have been carried out without permission or where an operation was started outside the four year period but not substantially completed outside that period , the notice may nevertheless require the removal of all the works including ancillary works : Ewen Developments Ltd v Secretary of State for the Environment -LSB- 1980 -RSB- JPL 404 , CA ; Howes v Secretary of State for the Environment -LSB- 1984 -RSB- JPL 439 , Hodgson J ; Somak Travel v London Borough of Brent -LSB- 1987 -RSB- JPL 630 Stuart-Smith J . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	164	The first of these upheld a requirement that the whole of an embankment be removed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	165	In the second the inspector had directed himself that the removal of a hedge and the creation of an access was `` a continuous operation and each step in the work prolong -LSB- ed -RSB- the period for serving the enforcement notice as regards every earlier step of the development '' : the judge upheld the notice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	166	The third case involved an unauthorised change of use case from residential to commercial use . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	167	The notice not only required the cessation of the commercial use but also the removal of an internal staircase which had been put in to facilitate that use though in itself the staircase had not required permission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	168	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	169	These decisions underline the holistic structure of planning law and contradict the basis upon which the Court of Appeal reached its decision in favour of Mr Sage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	170	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	171	Finally , it was argued for Mr Sage that the inspector should have had express regard to an inspector 's decision letter reported in -LSB- 1972 -RSB- JPL 385 where the facts bore some similarity to those of the present case and he had held the enforcement notice to be out of time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	172	However that decision was based upon the finding by the inspector that `` the appeal building had become a viable building more than four years before -LSB- the -RSB- service of the notice and that in the form which it then took it -LSB- was -RSB- immune from enforcement action '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse
55	173	The inspector 's finding in the present case was that the structure was best described as a dwelling in the course of construction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	174	The inspector was right to think that the 1972 decision did not help ; indeed it was adverse to Mr Sage 's case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	175	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	176	Accordingly the inspector 's decision was correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	177	The Notice had not been served after the end of the period of four years beginning with the date on which the building operations were substantially completed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	178	Indeed they had still not been substantially completed at the date of the Notice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	179	The appeal should be allowed and Mr Sage 's CPR Pt. 8 proceedings dismissed and the orders of the judge and the Court of Appeal set aside , including the costs orders made in favour of Mr Sage . 	lord hobhouse	self	outcome	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	180	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	181	Leave to appeal to your Lordships ' House was given `` on terms that , if successful , the petitioners do not seek any order for costs against the respondent '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse

55	183	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	184	LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	185	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	186	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	187	I have had the advantage of reading in advance the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough and gratefully adopt his exposition of the facts and statutory provisions that have given rise to this appeal to the House . 	lord scott	lord hobhouse	ackn	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	187	I have had the advantage of reading in advance the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough and gratefully adopt his exposition of the facts and statutory provisions that have given rise to this appeal to the House . 	lord scott	lord hobhouse	factagr	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	188	I , like your Lordships , have come to the conclusion that this appeal by Maidstone Borough Council should be allowed and I am in general agreement with the reasons expressed by Lord Hobhouse as to why that should be so . 	lord scott	lord hobhouse	partagr	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	188	I , like your Lordships , have come to the conclusion that this appeal by Maidstone Borough Council should be allowed and I am in general agreement with the reasons expressed by Lord Hobhouse as to why that should be so . 	lord scott	self	outcome	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	189	There is , however , an aspect of this case which seems to me unsatisfactory and I think I should explain what it is . 	lord scott	lord hobhouse	partdisa	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	190	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	191	The purpose of section 171B of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 -LRB- added to the 1990 Act by amendment with effect from 2 January 1994 : see s 4 , Planning and Compensation Act 1991 and SI 1991/2905 -RRB- was , as Lord Hobhouse has explained in para 10 of his opinion , to introduce a straightforward , easily applied , set of time limits within which enforcement action to remedy breaches of planning control must be brought . 	lord scott	lord hobhouse	partagr	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	192	The section divides breaches of planning control into three categories . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	193	First , where the breach consists of `` building , engineering , mining or other operations '' over land , enforcement action can not be taken after four years from `` the date on which the operations were substantially completed . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	194	-LRB- sub-section -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	195	Second , where the breach consists of a change in the use of a building to use as a single dwelling house , enforcement action can not be taken after four years `` beginning with the date of the breach '' -LRB- sub-section -LRB- 2 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	196	And , third , in the case of any other breach of planning control , enforcement action can not be taken after ten years beginning with the date of the breach -LRB- sub-section -LRB- 3 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	197	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	198	In the present case Mr Sage , without planning permission , commenced the building of a dwelling house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse
55	199	In 1994 , however , while the dwelling house was still uncompleted he ceased his building works . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	200	The building , such as it then was , although uncompleted as a dwelling house , had reached a stage of construction in which it was capable of use for other purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	201	It could , in particular , be used for agricultural purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	202	Hay , straw or grain could be stored in it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	203	Agricultural machinery of a size small enough to be manoeuvred through the single entrance door could be sheltered in it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	204	Livestock or poultry could be kept in it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	205	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	206	The council served an enforcement notice on Mr Sage on 19 March 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	207	This was more than four years after the building work had ceased . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	208	The issue before the Inspector centred on the question whether or when the building operations were `` substantially completed '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	209	It is , in my opinion , important to notice how the argument proceeded before the Inspector and in the courts below . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	210	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	211	The Inspector recorded in his Decision letter -LRB- para 22 -RRB- that the issue was whether the building was an agricultural structure , as Mr Sage contended , or an uncompleted dwelling house , as the Council contended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	212	In paragraph 26 the Inspector made the important finding that '' ... as a matter of fact and degree , ... having regard to its layout and appearance , -LSB- the building -RSB- is not an agricultural building and was not designed as such . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	213	This finding was not challenged in the courts below and was expressly accepted before your Lordships by counsel for Mr Sage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	214	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	215	Accordingly , in the courts below and before the House the argument was whether , for the purposes of section 171B -LRB- 1 -RRB- the building of the intended dwelling house , in the state in which the building works stood in 1994 , was `` substantially completed '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	216	My noble and learned friend Lord Hobhouse has analysed the arguments and concluded that the Inspector 's decision that the building operations were not substantially completed was correct . 	lord scott	lord hobhouse	partagr	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	217	On the premise that the Inspector was faced with an uncompleted dwelling house , I respectfully agree . 	lord scott	lord hobhouse	partagr	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	218	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	219	My concern , however , is with the premise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	220	I have no doubt at all that the Inspector was right in concluding that what had been designed by Mr Sage and what he had been building was a structure intended for use as a dwelling house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	221	But the classification of a building , for planning purposes and as a matter of common sense , is not immutable but can change if the use to which the building is put changes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	222	It is a common feature in this country for agricultural barns to be converted into dwellings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	223	Once the conversion is complete and use of the property as a dwelling commences , and perhaps at an earlier point of time , the classification of the building as a barn ceases to be accurate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	224	Planning permission for any building operations involved in the conversion and for the change of use should , of course , have been obtained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	225	But the change in the appropriate classification of the building , from agricultural barn to dwelling house , would not depend on whether planning permission had been obtained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse
55	226	It would be a question of fact . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	227	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	228	Conversely , dwellings may become agricultural barns . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	229	There are throughout the countryside , usually well off the beaten track , innumerable examples of buildings which have been farm workers ' cottages but which , with increasing agricultural mechanization , have become surplus to farming requirements and have , usually in some state of disrepair , become used for storage of hay or straw or for sheltering livestock . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	230	Planning permission is , I suspect , very rarely sought for this change of use , but here , too , classification of the building as a dwelling or as a barn is a question of fact , dependant on the permanency of the use to which it is being put and the intentions of the owner in that regard . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	231	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	232	Just as change of use can change the appropriate classification of a completed building so , too , in my opinion , there can be no logical objection to the appropriate classification of a building in course of construction being changed by use , or by intentions for future use , of the uncompleted building inconsistent with its original classification . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	233	As with a completed building , the change could be either a change from an uncompleted agricultural building to an uncompleted dwelling , or a change from an uncompleted dwelling to an agricultural barn , whether completed or uncompleted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	234	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	235	For example , under the Town and Country Planning General Development Order 1988 -LRB- SI 1988/1813 -RRB- planning permission is in general not necessary for the erection of a building which is reasonably necessary for the purposes of agriculture . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	236	A farmer who commenced the construction of such a building would not , by doing so , be in breach of planning control . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	237	But if , before the building operations were complete , his intentions changed and he began to install a bathroom and other features indicative of a dwelling , the operations would be in breach of planning control . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	238	Conversely , I suggest , in a case where the construction of a building as an additional dwelling has been commenced by a farmer but before the building is complete he changes his mind , decides to use the uncompleted building for agricultural purposes and actually does commence and continue that use , the classification of the structure as an uncompleted dwelling would no longer be accurate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	239	The structure would have become an agricultural building . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	240	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	241	The correct application of the section 171B time limits to a case where the building operations intended at the outset have not been completed but the use to which the structure has been put since the building operation ceased has changed the nature of the building from one which did require planning permission to one which did not may raise difficult questions of fact and law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	242	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	243	In principle , however , there must , in my opinion , be some time limit after which it would no longer be open for enforcement action in respect of the original planning breach to be taken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	244	The present case may be taken as an example . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	245	The building works ceased in 1994 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	246	The enforcement action was taken in 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	247	Let it be assumed that at some point between those two dates Mr Sage decided he would not complete the originally intended dwelling but would instead use the structure for his agricultural purposes and that he thereafter did use the structure for those purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	248	It can not , in my opinion , be the case that for an indefinite and open-ended period the Council would remain free to commence enforcement action contending that the structure still remained a substantially uncompleted dwelling house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	249	Such a state of affairs would , in my opinion , be inconsistent with the scheme of section 171B . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	250	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	251	These reflections are of no assistance to Mr Sage in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse
55	252	There is no evidence of the use to which the uncompleted structure was put by Mr Sage in the period between 1994 and 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse
55	253	There are no facts in evidence which enable to be identified a date after which the 1994 structure could be regarded as no longer an uncompleted dwelling but as having become an agricultural building . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse
55	254	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse
55	255	There have , naturally , been no submissions from counsel on either side as to how section 171B would have had to be applied if there had been such evidence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse
55	256	It seems to me , however , well arguable that it would no longer be open for enforcement action to be taken in respect of an uncompleted dwelling house if a period of more than four years had elapsed since the structure had become , de facto , an agricultural building . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse
55	257	I think it is important to be clear that nothing in the result of the present case decides that issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse
55	258	However , I agree that this appeal must be allowed and the order proposed by Lord Hobhouse should be made . 	lord scott	self	outcome	1	lord hobhouse
