40	2	LORD SLYNN OF HADLEY 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	4	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	5	This appeal raises an important question in the context of planning law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	6	The facts and the issues are set out in the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn to which I gratefully refer . 	lord slynn	lord steyn	factagr	0	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	7	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	8	In summary , a committee of the local planning authority decided on 15 September 1999 that planning permission should be granted for a large scale development in Fulham subject to certain conditions being fulfilled . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	9	On 6 April 2000 the appellant applied for leave to move for judicial review of that decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	10	On 12 May 2000 planning permission was actually granted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	11	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	12	At that time Order 53 r 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Rules of the Supreme Court provided that an application for leave to apply for judicial review should be made `` promptly and in any event within three months from the date when grounds for the application first arose '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	13	If the relevant date was 15 September 1999 the application was clearly out of time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	14	Richards J and the Court of Appeal refused permission on the ground that the application was out of time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	15	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	16	It is clear that if the challenge is to the resolution -LRB- as it may be -RRB- time runs from that date , but the question on the present appeal is whether , if the application is amended to challenge the grant of planning permission rather than the resolution , time runs from 15 September 1999 or 12 May 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	17	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	18	In my opinion , for the reasons given by Lord Steyn , where there is a challenge to the grant itself , time runs from the date of the grant and not from the date of the resolution . 	lord slynn	lord steyn	NAN	0	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	19	It seems to me clear that because someone fails to challenge in time a resolution conditionally authorising the grant of planning permission , that failure does not prevent a challenge to the grant itself if brought in time , i e from the date when the planning permission is granted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	20	I realise that this may cause some difficulties in practice , both for local authorities and for developers , but for the grant not to be capable of challenge , because the resolution has not been challenged in time , seems to me wrongly to restrict the right of the citizen to protect his interests . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	21	The relevant legislative provisions do not compel such a result nor do principles of administrative law prevent a challenge to the grant even if the grounds relied on are broadly the same as those which if brought in time would have been relied on to challenge the resolution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	22	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	23	The question whether an obligation to apply `` promptly '' is sufficient to satisfy European Community law or Convention rights as to certainty does not arise in this case and I do not comment on it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	24	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	25	As to the preliminary objection to the House 's jurisdiction this case is plainly distinguishable from In re Poh -LSB- 1983 -RSB- 1 WLR 2 since the Court of Appeal here gave leave to appeal from the judge and heard the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	26	It is wholly unacceptable that the House should not have jurisdiction to hear such an appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	27	I consider in any event that the dictum in In re Poh which is relied on for the contrary result should be laid to rest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	28	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	29	I would accordingly allow the appeal and remit the substantive question to the High Court for decision . 	lord slynn	self	outcome	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn

40	33	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	34	This appeal raises important questions of law in regard to delay in launching judicial review proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	35	The context is town planning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	36	The proposal concerns a large development at Imperial Wharf , Fulham , London . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	37	The appellant is Mrs Burkett who lives in a ground floor maisonette adjoining the site . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	38	She believes that the development will have an adverse effect on her quality of life and the health of her family . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	39	The respondent is the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham -LRB- `` the local authority '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	40	St George West London Ltd is the developer and is joined in the proceedings as an interested party -LRB- `` the developer '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	41	It will be necessary to explain the circumstances of the case in some detail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	42	There is , however , an anterior legal question to be considered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	43	I. Jurisdiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	44	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	45	The issue arises in this way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	46	Mrs Burkett and her late husband applied for judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	47	The matter came before Richards J . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	48	He refused permission on the grounds of delay . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	49	The Court of Appeal granted permission to the applicants to appeal from the decision of Richards J . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	50	After a full inter partes hearing the Court of Appeal refused permission to seek judicial review on grounds of delay and dismissed the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	51	The Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	52	An Appeal Committee granted leave to appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	53	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	54	Relying on the decision of the House of Lords in In re Poh -LSB- 1983 -RSB- 1 WLR 2 counsel for the local authority submitted that the House does not have jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a decision by the Court of Appeal refusing permission to seek judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	55	In In re Poh the judge had refused leave to apply for judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	56	The applicant appealed ex parte by originating motion to the Court of Appeal who refused leave . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	57	The applicant sought leave to appeal to the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	58	The House ruled that there was no jurisdiction to grant leave . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	59	Giving the brief reasons of the House Lord Diplock observed , at p 31 : `` Their Lordships are not concerned with the procedure whereby this application moved from the Divisional Court to the Court of Appeal , because the question we have to consider is whether this House has jurisdiction to entertain the application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	60	Counsel instructed by the Treasury Solicitor has taken the preliminary point that the House has no jurisdiction under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 to entertain an appeal from refusal of leave to apply for judicial review under RSC Ord 53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	61	He relies upon the construction of section 3 of the Act of 1876 which was approved by this House in Lane v Esdaile -LSB- 1891 -RSB- AC 210 '' Three points need to be noted about this statement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	62	First , Lane v Esdaile is only authority for the general proposition that whenever a power is given to a court or tribunal by legislation to grant or refuse leave to appeal , the decision of that authority is , from the very nature of the thing , final and conclusive : see In re Housing of the Working Classes Act 1890 , Ex p Stevenson -LSB- 1892 -RSB- 1 QB 609 -LRB- Court of Appeal -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	63	Secondly , Lord Diplock extended this rule to an appeal from a refusal of leave to apply for judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	64	Thirdly , Lord Diplock gave no reasons for this extension of the Lane v Esdaile principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	65	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	66	The decision in In re Poh has proved troublesome . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	67	In Kemper Reinsurance Co v Minister of Finance -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 1 AC 1 the Privy Council cast doubt on the reasoning in In re Poh . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	68	Lord Hoffmann observed , at p 18B , that a renewed application to the Court of Appeal under RSC Ord 59 , r 14 -LRB- 3 -RRB- is a true appeal with a procedure adapted to its ex parte nature . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	69	Referring to In re Poh Lord Hoffmann stated : `` It would not be right for their Lordships to make any comment upon this decision in its application to appeals from the English Court of Appeal to the House of Lords . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	70	But the judgment expressly disclaimed any expression of view upon the nature of ` the procedure whereby this appeal moved from the Divisional Court to the Court of Appeal ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	71	The decision is therefore not inconsistent with their Lordships ' opinion that the application to the Court of Appeal is a true appeal , not excluded by the principle in Lane v Esdaile . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	72	Their Lordships accept that this conclusion makes it difficult to identify the reasoning by which the House of Lords decided that the principle applied to a further appeal to the House of Lords '' In R v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry , Ex p Eastaway -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 1 WLR 2222 the House considered In re Poh but did not have to rule on its status . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	73	The Eastaway case is only authority for the proposition that when the Court of Appeal has refused permission to appeal in the face of a first instance refusal of permission to seek judicial review the House has no jurisdiction to give leave to appeal : see at p 2228A-B . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	74	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	75	Counsel for the local authority submitted that the decision in In re Poh -LSB- 1983 -RSB- 1 WLR 2 , read with the observation that '' -LSB- their -RSB- Lordships are not concerned with the procedure whereby this application moved from the Divisional Court to the Court of Appeal '' , appears to deprive the House of jurisdiction to entertain the present appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	76	A material difference , however , is that in the present case the Court of Appeal granted leave to appeal and heard the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	77	It would be extraordinary if in such a case the House had no jurisdiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	78	Nothing in statute law or in Lane v Esdaile -LSB- 1891 -RSB- AC 210 provides any support for such a view . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	79	Moreover , as Lord Hoffmann pointed out in the Kemper case -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 1 AC 1 , 18B-C , it has never been suggested either before or after the decision in In re Poh that appeals to the Court of Appeal against refusal by the High Court of leave to apply for judicial review is caught by the rule in Lane v Esdaile . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	80	In my view the conclusion is inescapable that Lord Diplock 's extempore observation was not correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	81	It follows that the House has jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal against a refusal by the Court of Appeal of permission to apply for judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	82	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	83	The jurisdictional objection to the hearing of the appeal must be rejected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	84	II . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	85	The Legal Background . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	86	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	87	In order to make the case intelligible it is necessary to set out some of the legal background to the planning application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	88	Environmental assessment pursuant to Council Directive of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment -LRB- 85/337/EEC -RRB- is a fundamental instrument of European Community policy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	89	The preambles of the Directive include the following : `` Whereas ... the best environmental policy consists in preventing the creation of pollution or nuisances at source , rather than subsequently trying to counteract their effects ; whereas they affirm the need to take effects on the environment into account at the earliest possible stage in all technical planning and decision-making processes ; whereas to that end they provide for the implementation of procedures to evaluate such effects ; . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	90	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	91	. 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	92	Whereas development consent for public and private projects which are likely to have significant effects on the environment should be granted only after proper assessment of the likely significant effects of these projects has been carried out whereas this assessment must be conducted on the basis of the appropriate information supplied by the developer , which may be supplemented by the authorities and by the people who may be concerned by the project in question ; '' Article 2 provides : `` 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	93	Member states shall adopt all measures necessary to ensure that , before consent is given , projects likely to have significant effects on the environment by virtue , inter alia , of their nature , size or location are made subject to a requirement for development consent and an assessment with regard to their effects . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	94	Article 5 provides : `` 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	95	The information to be provided by the developer in accordance with paragraph 1 shall include at least : - a description of the project comprising information on the site , design and size of the project , - a description of the measures envisaged in order to avoid , reduce and , if possible , remedy significant adverse effects '' The Directive creates rights for individuals enforceable in the courts : World Wildlife Fund -LRB- WWF -RRB- v Autonome Provinz Bozen -LRB- Case C-435 / 97 -RRB- -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 1 CMLR 149 , paras 69-71 ; Berkeley v Secretary of State for the Environment -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 2 AC 603 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	96	There is an obligation on national courts to ensure that individual rights are fully and effectively protected : see the Berkeley case , at pp 608D -LRB- Lord Bingham of Cornhill -RRB- and 618B-H . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	97	The Directive seeks to redress to some extent the imbalance in resources between promoters of major developments and those concerned , on behalf of individual or community interests , about the environmental effects of such projects . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	98	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	99	It is unnecessary to describe the familiar planning regime enshrined in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	100	For present purposes it is sufficient to point out that there is a general prohibition on the grant of planning permission without consideration of environmental information : Town and Country Planning -LRB- Assessment of Environmental Effects -RRB- Regulations 1988 -LRB- SI 1988 No 1199 -RRB- , regulation 4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	101	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	102	Persons aggrieved by planning decisions may seek permission to apply for judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	103	Rules of court govern the making of judicial review applications . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	104	For present purposes provisions dealing with delay are directly relevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	105	At the relevant time RSC Ord 53 , r 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , was in force . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	106	It provided : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- An application for leave to apply for judicial review shall be made promptly and in any event within three months from the date when grounds for the application first arose unless the court considers that there is good reason for extending the period within which the application shall be made . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	107	It has now been replaced by rule 54.5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Civil Procedure Rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	108	It provides in respect of applications for judicial review : `` The claim form must be filed -- -LRB- a -RRB- promptly ; and -LRB- b -RRB- in any event not later than three months after the grounds to make the claim first arose . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	109	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	110	It is also necessary to draw attention to section 31 -LRB- 6 -RRB- of the Supreme Court Act 1981 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	111	It provides : `` Where the High Court considers that there has been undue delay in making an application for judicial review , the court may refuse to grant - -LRB- a -RRB- leave for the making of the application ; or -LRB- b -RRB- any relief sought on the application , if it considers that the granting of the relief sought would be likely to cause substantial hardship to , or substantially prejudice the rights of , any person or would be detrimental to good administration . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	112	The differences between the rules of court and section 31 -LRB- 6 -RRB- are analysed in Craig , Administrative Law , 4th ed -LRB- 1999 -RRB- , pp 791-793 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	113	Pertinent to the present context is the fact that section 31 -LRB- 6 -RRB- contains no date from which time runs and accordingly no specific time limit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	114	It is , however , a useful reserve power in some cases , such as where an application made well within the three month period would cause immense practical difficulties . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	115	An illustration is R v Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council , Ex p B , C , and K -LSB- 2000 -RSB- Ed CR 117 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	116	Having referred to section 31 -LRB- 6 -RRB- , Mr David Pannick QC -LRB- sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court -RRB- stated , at p 120 : `` In my judgment , it is absolutely essential that , if parents are to bring judicial review proceedings in relation to the allocation of places at secondary school for their children , the matter is heard and determined by court , absent very exceptional circumstances , before the school term starts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	117	This is for obvious reasons relating to the interests of the child concerned , the interests of the school , the interests of the other children at the affected school and , of course , the teachers at that school . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	118	The good sense of this approach is manifest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	119	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	120	Finally , for the sake of completeness , I refer to the statement by Wade and Forsyth , Administrative Law , 8th ed -LRB- 2000 -RRB- , p 688 that the most active remedies of administrative law - declaration , injunction , certiorari , prohibition , mandamus - are discretionary and the court may therefore withhold them if it thinks fit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	121	On the other hand , as the same authors point out , '' -LRB- the -RRB- true scope for discretion is in the law of remedies , where it operates within narrow and recognised limits '' III . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	122	The Planning Application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord slynn, lord steyn

40	124	Imperial Wharf is a site comprising some 32 acres . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	125	It had formerly been used by British Gas for operational purposes , and parts of the site had been let out for industrial use . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	126	On 26 February 1998 the developer applied to the local authority for outline planning permission for : `` A mixed use development comprising 1,803 residential units -LRB- 1303 private flats and 500 affordable dwellings in the form of flats and houses -RRB- , an hotel , class A1 retail , class A3 restaurant , class D community uses , health and fitness club , class B1 offices , public open space and riverside walk , together with associated car parking , landscaping and access road . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	127	It is one of the largest current development sites in London . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	128	The application for outline planning permission proposed that design , external appearance and landscaping of the whole development were to be reserved for later determination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	129	The proposed scheme was not in accordance with the development plan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	130	On 16 March 1998 the local authority asked the developer to submit an environmental statement with the planning application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	131	On 27 May 1998 the developer submitted a document described as an environmental statement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	132	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	133	The agreed statement of facts and issues explains the potential impact of the development on Mrs Burkett and her daughter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	134	Mrs Burkett lives with her asthmatic daughter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	135	Their home and garden are immediately adjacent to the site . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	136	Her husband died after the Court of Appeal decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	137	He had been a chronic diabetic with a liver disorder and had been housebound for much of the time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	138	Works have regularly caused dust to cover all the surfaces in the maisonette . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	139	A particular concern has been the effect of the development on the health of the family . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	140	In 1999 , at a tenants ' association meeting , Mr and Mrs Burkett were advised that they could not remove the paving blocks from their garden and replace them with lawn because of problems of contamination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	141	This was apparently due to previous contamination of the land . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	142	On 30 July 1999 Mrs Burkett 's solicitors , Richard Buxton , then assisting a pressure group on a pro bono basis , wrote to the local authority warning that the environmental statement was inadequate and that it would be unlawful to approve the planning application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn

40	145	On 15 September 1999 the local authority 's planning and traffic management committee considered the application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	146	The committee resolved to refer the application to the Secretary of State as a departure from the development plan . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	147	It further resolved to authorise the director of the environment department of the local authority to grant outline permission subject to -LRB- i -RRB- completion of a satisfactory agreement enforceable pursuant to section 106 of the 1990 Act and -LRB- ii -RRB- there being no contrary direction on behalf of the Secretary of State from the Government Office for London . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	148	On 5 October 1999 the Government Office for London imposed a direction pursuant to article 14 of the Town and Country Planning Act -LRB- General Development Procedure Order -RRB- 1995 -LRB- SI 1995 No 419 -RRB- prohibiting the grant of permission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	149	On 24 February 2000 the Government Office for London decided not to call in the application and lifted the prohibition under article 14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	150	On 28 March 2000 Richard Buxton wrote to the local authority expressing concerns about the inadequacies of the environmental statement and inviting reconsideration by the local authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	151	On 29 March 2000 the local authority replied asking for further particulars of the claimed inadequacies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn

40	155	On 6 April 2000 Mr and Mrs Burkett submitted an application for permission to apply the judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	156	Form 86A identified the decision to be challenged as the resolution of 15 September 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	157	It described the substantive relief sought as `` An order for certiorari to quash the above resolution '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	158	It will be observed that the application was made more than six months after the resolution of 15 September 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	159	On 17 April 2000 Richard Buxton sent a copy of the application for judicial review to the local authority again inviting them to reconsider the resolution for the grant of planning permission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	160	On 19 April 2000 the local authority told the Crown Office that it might wish to make representations both on delay and on the substantive grounds of challenge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	161	The local authority told the developer of the application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	162	On 25 April 2000 Richard Buxton reminded the local authority that it had a complete copy of the application for perm . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	163	to apply for judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn

40	167	On 12 May 2000 the local authority and the developer completed an agreement under section 106 of the 1990 Act in respect of the developer 's planning obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	168	Acting on the authority of the resolution of 15 September 1999 the director of the environment Department of the local authority granted outline planning permission on the same day . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn

40	171	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	172	On 18 May 2000 Newman J refused permission to apply for judicial review on the papers in respect of both delay and merits . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	173	On 29 June 2000 Richards J accepted after reading what he described as detailed skeleton arguments from the local authority and the developer , but without hearing oral arguments from them , that the grounds for judicial review were , on the merits , arguable but refused permission on the grounds of delay . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	174	In an unreported judgment Richards J addressed the critical question as follows : `` When did grounds for the application first arise ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	175	-LSB- Counsel for the applicants -RSB- submits that it was reasonable to wait until the Secretary of State 's decision not to call the application in . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	176	Alternatively , he would , if necessary , contend that the relevant date is the date when planning permission was actually granted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	177	In my judgment , however , the relevant date was the date when the respondent passed its resolution to grant outline planning permission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	178	That was the operative decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	179	That - not some later event - is what is challenged in the Form 86A . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	180	The fact that there were still a number of contingencies before the formal grant of planning permission does not mean that grounds for the application arose only at some later date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	181	The existence of those contingencies is a matter to be considered in relation to the discretion to extend time , if there was a failure to apply promptly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	182	It does not , in my view , lead to the conclusion that time did not begin to run at the date of the resolution . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	183	In the circumstances , and particularly in the absence of a clear warning by the applicants to the local authority , the judge refused to extend time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	184	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	185	On 20 November 2000 the Court of Appeal granted permission to appeal and heard the appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	186	The Court of Appeal did not examine the merits of the substantive issues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	187	It concentrated on the issue of delay . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	188	Counsel for the applicants had argued that the final grant of planning permission is the single event from which all rights and obligations flow and it is therefore the date from which time runs against the citizen . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	189	In the judgment of the court -LRB- Ward , Sedley and Jonathan Parker LJJ -RRB- , given on 13 December , this argument is dismissed on the following ground -LRB- paragraph 8 -RRB- : `` The applicants ' argument , as -LSB- counsel for the local authority -RSB- amply demonstrated , faces two initial hurdles . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	190	One is that their Form 86A , lodged on 6 April 2000 , specifies the resolution of 15 September 1999 as the decision to be challenged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	191	The other is that , on the face of it , it is right to do so , since Order 53 rule 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Rules of the Supreme Court , which were then in force , in terms required an application for leave to be ` made promptly and in any event within three months from the date when grounds for the application first arose ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	192	Since the impugned environmental impact statement was as necessary to the resolution as to any subsequent steps , the logic of measuring time from the resolution seems inescapable . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	193	Acknowledging `` that nothing in a resolution is irrevocable until planning permission is actually granted '' -LRB- paragraph 10 -RRB- the Court of Appeal observed -LRB- paragraph 11 -RRB- : `` We do not doubt the legal accuracy of any of this , but it fails in our judgment to disturb the proposition that where the same objection affects the initial resolution as will affect the eventual grant of permission , it is as a simple matter of language at the date of the resolution that the objection and therefore the grounds for the application first arise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	194	We do not accept -LSB- counsel for the applicants ' -RSB- submission that to give effect to this construction of Order 53 rule 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , any more than to its successor provision in Part 54 of the Civil Procedure Rules , disrupts the statutory environmental impact regime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	195	What it does is require an objector to strike at the earliest reasonable moment at a process which , if the objection is sound , will otherwise end in an unlawful grant of planning permission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	196	By doing so it supports the objectives of -LSB- Council Directive -LRB- 85/337/EEC -RRB- -RSB- and the -LSB- 1988 -RSB- Regulations and attempts to keep disruption to a minimum . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	197	On this basis the Court of Appeal concluded that the judge 's refusal to extend time was a decision open to him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	198	The Court of Appeal -LSB- 2001 -RSB- JPL 775 dismissed the appeal and refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	199	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	200	On 23 July 2000 an Appeal Committee of the House of Lords granted leave to appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn

40	202	The Principal Issues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	203	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	204	For the purposes of the appeal to the House it must be assumed - as Richards J and the Court of Appeal had done - that Mrs Burkett has an arguable case on the substantive merits of her judicial review application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	205	The only issues on this appeal relate to the matters of delay . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	206	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	207	Richards J and the Court of Appeal held that the three months time limit for seeking judicial review ran from the date of the resolution of 15 September 1999 and not from the date of the decision not to call in the planning application on 24 February 2000 or the decision to grant planning permission on 12 May 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	208	The local authority and developer submit that the decisions below were correct as a matter of domestic law and are unaffected by European law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	209	Mrs Burkett 's primary contention is that the time limit of three months only ran against her from the date of the actual grant of planning permission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	210	Alternatively , she contends that time only runs from the time that the Secretary of State decided not to call in the application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	211	She relies in the first place on the proper construction of the rules of court as a matter of domestic law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	212	But she also prays in aid the European principles of legal certainty and effective enforcement of Community law in support of her contention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	213	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	214	It will be convenient first to consider the principal issue of the interpretation of the rules of court under domestic law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	215	In my view oral argument convincingly showed that the real choice is between holding that under RSC Ord 53 , r 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , the grounds for the application first arose on -LRB- a -RRB- the date of the resolution or -LRB- b -RRB- the date of the actual grant of planning permission , the latter being the first date by which rights and obligations were created . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	216	The date when the Secretary of State decided not to call in the application has little to commend it as the operative date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	217	So far as finality is relevant , that date left the planning decision in suspense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	218	I will therefore concentrate on what I regard as the real choice before the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	219	VIII . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	220	A Procedural Point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	221	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	222	Richards J and the Court of Appeal regarded it as a serious obstacle that the application for judicial review was directed against the resolution of 15 September 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	223	That was the case because the application had been made before the grant of permission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	224	If this is an insuperable obstacle , the important points of law involved in this appeal would have to await decision in another case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	225	In my view this difficulty can be overcome . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	226	In public law the emphasis should be on substance rather than form . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	227	If the correct construction of the rules is that in respect of a challenge to planning permission time only runs from the date of the grant of permission , it would be unjust to dismiss the appeal on this ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	228	Counsel for Mrs Burkett put forward a suitable amendment directed to the grant of permission on 12 May 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	229	In my view there is no reason why such an amendment , and any other consequential amendments , can not be granted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	230	In this way any procedural difficulty can be cured . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	231	It is therefore possible to put this technical point to one side and to concentrate on the legal issues before the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	232	IX . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	233	The Status of the Resolution 32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	234	The resolution of 15 September 1999 gave authority to a designated council official to grant planning permission subject to -LRB- i -RRB- there being no call in decision by the Secretary of State and -LRB- ii -RRB- completion of a satisfactory agreement enforceable pursuant to section 106 of the 1990 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	235	There were therefore two conditions precedent to a binding planning permission coming into existence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	236	It is common ground that the resolution by itself created no legal rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	237	Only upon the fulfilment of both conditions precedent , and the grant of planning permission , did rights and obligations as between the local authority , the developer and affected individuals come into existence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	238	Until all these things had happened the resolution was revocable not by the designated official but by the local authority itself . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	239	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	240	The first condition precedent was fulfilled on 24 February 2000 when the Secretary of State decided not to call in the application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	241	The second condition was fulfilled on 12 May 2000 when the section 106 agreement was concluded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	242	Only on that date was it possible to grant planning permission giving rise to rights and obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	243	It is this second condition which requires some further explanation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	244	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	245	The resolution of 15 September 1999 was adopted by the committee against the background of a supplementary agenda which informed members : `` Critical to the assessment of this application is the proposed 106 agreement which needs to be understood as part of the overall proposal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	246	Without this proposal this proposal would be wholly unacceptable '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	247	The proposal for which members of the committee voted on 15 September 1999 was therefore inchoate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	248	It would be wrong to assume that the negotiation and conclusion of the agreement of the section 106 agreement was a formality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	249	It was only completed eight months after the initial resolution , and three months after the Secretary of State 's decision not to call in the application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	250	It was a complex agreement running to about 190 pages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	251	Some of the provisions were apparently in planning terms of major importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	252	While the House has not examined the agreement , counsel for Mrs Burkett pointed out that it included provisions regarding highway improvements , work on a roundabout nearby , the provision of 60 units of housing for a social landlord , and other material provisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	253	I did not understand this to be a matter of dispute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	254	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	255	The position is therefore that until 12 May 2000 it was uncertain whether the resolution of 15 September 1999 would be implemented . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	256	X . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	257	The Interpretation and Application of the Rules of Court 36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	258	I have already drawn attention to the provisions of section 31 -LRB- 6 -RRB- of the 1981 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	259	Nobody has suggested that the outcome of the appeal in the present case can be affected by section 31 -LRB- 6 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	260	The debate has centred on the correct interpretation and application of the rules of court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	261	That is how I will approach the matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	262	There is no material difference between the provisions of RSC Ord 53 , r 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and CPR r 54.5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	263	I will address the language of the former . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	264	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	265	The case was decided by the Court of Appeal not on the ground of a lack of promptitude in making the judicial review application but on the ground that more than three months had elapsed after the resolution of 15 September 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	266	Whether that is the correct date depends on the interpretation and application of the words `` from the date when the grounds for the application first arose '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	267	If in respect of a challenge to the actual grant of permission time runs -LRB- to use convenient shorthand for the statutory words -RRB- from the date of the resolution , the decisions below were correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	268	On the other hand , if in respect of a challenge to the actual grant of permission time runs from the date of the grant , the decisions below were wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	269	This is the critical issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	270	In considering this question one must bear in mind that RSC Ord 53 , r 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- and for that matter CPR r 54.5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- are not specifically targeted at town planning applications . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	271	These provisions apply across the spectrum of judicial review applications . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	272	Making due allowance for the special features of town planning applications , an interpretation is to be preferred which is capable of applying to the generality of cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	273	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	274	Leaving to one side for the moment the application of Ord 53 , r 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- on the running of time against a judicial review applicant , it can readily be accepted that for substantive judicial review purposes the decision challenged does not have to be absolutely final . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	275	In a context where there is a statutory procedure involving preliminary decisions leading to a final decision affecting legal rights , judicial review may lie against a preliminary decision not affecting legal rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	276	Town planning provides a classic case of this flexibility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	277	Thus it is in principle possible to apply for judicial review in respect of a resolution to grant outline permission and for prohibition even in advance of it : see generally Wade & Forsyth , Administrative Laws , 8th ed , p 600 ; Craig , Administrative Law , 4th ed , pp 724-725 ; Fordham , Judicial Review Handbook , 3rd ed -LRB- 2001 -RRB- , para 4.8.2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	278	It is clear therefore that if Mrs Burkett had acted in time , she could have challenged the resolution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	279	These propositions do not , however , solve the concrete problem before the House which is whether in respect of a challenge to a final planning decision time runs under Ord 53 , r 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- from the date of the resolution or from the date of the grant of planning permission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	280	It does not follow from the fact if Mrs Burkett had acted in time and challenged the resolution that she could not have waited until planning permission was granted and then challenged the grant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	281	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	282	As a matter of language it is possible to say in respect of a challenge to an alleged unlawful aspect of the grant of planning permission that `` grounds for the application first arose '' when the decision was made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	283	The ground for challenging the resolution is that it is a decision to do an unlawful act in the future ; the ground for challenging the actual grant is that an unlawful act has taken place . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	284	And the fact that the element of unlawfulness was already foreseeable at earlier stages in the planning process does not detract from this natural and obvious meaning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	285	The context supports this interpretation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	286	Until the actual grant of planning permission the resolution has no legal effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	287	It is unlawful for the developer to commence any works in reliance on the resolution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	288	And a developer expends money on the project before planning permission is granted at his own risk . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	289	The resolution may come to nothing because of a change of circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	290	It may fall to the ground because of conditions which are not fulfilled . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	291	It may lapse because negotiations for the conclusion of a section 106 agreement break down . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	292	After the resolution is adopted the local authority may come under a duty to reconsider its decision if flaws are brought to its attention : R v West Oxfordshire District Council , Ex p C H Pearce Homes Ltd -LRB- 1986 -RRB- 26 RVR 156 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	293	Moreover , it is not in doubt that a local authority may in its discretion revoke an outline resolution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	294	In the search for the best contextual interpretation these factors tend to suggest that the date of the resolution does not trigger the three-month time limit in respect of a challenge to the actual grant of planning permission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	295	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	296	The contrary argument is that it is disruptive of good administration for a citizen to delay his application until the actual grant of planning permission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	297	This is the view which Richards J and the Court of Appeal adopted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	298	It was also a view forcefully expressed by Laws J in the Divisional Court in R v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry , Ex p Greenpeace Ltd -LSB- 1998 -RSB- Env LR 415 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	299	In the context of a challenge to the award of North Sea licences he said , at p 424 : `` a judicial review applicant must move against the substantive act or decision which is the real basis of his complaint . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	300	If , after that act has been done , he takes no steps but merely waits until something consequential and dependent upon it takes place and then challenges that , he runs the risk of being put out of court for being too late ... '' This observation was cited with approval by Richards J and the Court of Appeal adopted this reasoning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	301	It is necessary to point out , however , that the judge in the Greenpeace case based his decision not only on the rules of court but also on broader considerations of his view of the function of the court in upholding the rule of law : see at p 422 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	302	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	303	The decision in the Greenpeace case was subsequently followed in a number of lower court decisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	304	There were also decisions to a contrary effect and there are cases where the court treated time as running from the date of the actual grant of planning permission without any examination of the issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	305	There is some discussion of such cases in two articles : Jones and Phillpot , `` When He Who Hesitates is Lost : Judicial Review of Planning Permissions '' -LSB- 2000 -RSB- JPL 564 and Roots and Walton , `` Promptness and Delay in Judicial Review - an update on the continuing saga '' -LSB- 2001 -RSB- JPL 1360 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	306	These cases involve judgments on applications for permission to apply for judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	307	Such cases are generally not regarded as authoritative : see Clark v University of Linconshire and Humberside -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 1 WLR 1988 , 1998-1999 paras 40-43 , per Lord Woolf MR. For my part the earlier decisions , other than the important judgment of Laws J in the Greenpeace case , can be regarded as overtaken by the Court of Appeal decision in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	308	It is therefore on the reasoning in the Greenpeace case and in the Court of Appeal judgment that I must concentrate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	309	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	310	The core of the reasoning of the Court of Appeal is that `` the impugned environmental impact statement was as necessary to the resolution as to any subsequent steps -LSB- and -RSB- the logic of measuring time from the resolution seems inescapable '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	311	In my view there is no such inevitable march of legal logic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	312	In law the resolution is not a juristic act giving rise to rights and obligations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	313	It is not inevitable that it will ripen into an actual grant of planning permission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	314	In these circumstances it would be curious if , when the actual grant of planning permission is challenged , a court could insist by retrospective judgment that the applicant ought to have moved earlier for judicial review against a preliminary decision `` which is the real basis of his complaint '' -LRB- the Greenpeace case , at p 424 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	315	Moreover , an application to declare a resolution unlawful might arguably be premature and be objected to on this ground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	316	And in strict law it could be dismissed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	317	The Court of Appeal was alive to this difficulty and observed that `` an arguably premature application can often be stayed or adjourned to await events '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	318	This is hardly a satisfactory explanation for placing a burden on a citizen to apply for relief in respect of a resolution which is still devoid of legal effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	319	For my part the substantive position is straightforward . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	320	The court has jurisdiction to entertain an application by a citizen for judicial review in respect of a resolution before or after its adoption . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	321	But it is a jump in legal logic to say that he must apply for such relief in respect of the resolution on pain of losing his right to judicial review of the actual grant of planning permission which does affect his rights . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	322	Such a view would also be in tension with the established principle that judicial review is a remedy of last resort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	323	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	324	At this stage it is necessary to return to the point that the rule of court applies across the board to judicial review applications . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	325	If a decision-maker indicates that , subject to hearing further representations , he is provisionally minded to make a decision adverse to a citizen , is it to be said that time runs against the citizen from the moment of the provisional expression of view ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	326	That would plainly not be sensible and would involve waste of time and money . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	327	Let me give a more concrete example . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	328	A licensing authority expresses a provisional view that a licence should be cancelled but indicates a willingness to hear further argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	329	The citizen contends that the proposed decision would be unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	330	Surely , a court might as a matter of discretion take the view that it would be premature to apply for judicial review as soon as the provisional decision is announced . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	331	And it would certainly be contrary to principle to require the citizen to take such premature legal action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	332	In my view the time limit under the rules of court would not run from the date of such preliminary decisions in respect of a challenge of the actual decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	333	If that is so , one is entitled to ask : what is the qualitative difference in town planning ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	334	There is , after all , nothing to indicate that , in regard to RSC Ord 53 , r 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , town planning is an island on its own . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	335	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	336	In R v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry , Ex p Greenpeace Ltd -LSB- 1998 -RSB- Env LR 415 and in the Court of Appeal in the present case the view was taken that the selection of the date of the resolution as the appropriate date would facilitate good administration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	337	There are two sides to this proposition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	338	It contemplates time running against a citizen before his rights are affected , thereby potentially involving a loss of a right to challenge what may perhaps be an abuse of power which in the interests of good administration should be exposed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	339	Undoubtedly , there is a need for public bodies to have certainty as to the legal validity of their actions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	340	That is the rationale of Ord 53 , r 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	341	On the other hand , it is far from clear that the selection of the actual grant of planning permission as the critical date would disadvantage developers and local authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	342	In their careful article Jones and Phillpot , `` When He Who Hesitates is Lost : Judicial Review of Planning Permissions '' -LSB- 2000 -RSB- JPL 564 , 588 argue : `` There would be a greater incentive for both the planning authority and the developer to move to ensure that the formal grant of planning permission is issued more speedily . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	343	This could be of advantage to developers wishing to progress the development of the site . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	344	From a public policy point of view it is important that speedy progress is made to issue the formal planning permissions for appropriate development . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	345	For my part the arguments in favour of time running from the date of resolution in the present case have been given undue weight by the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	346	In any event , there are a number of countervailing policy considerations to be considered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	347	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	348	First , the context is a rule of court which by operation of a time limit may deprive a citizen of the right to challenge an undoubted abuse of power . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	349	And such a challenge may involve not only individual rights but also community interests , as in environmental cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	350	This is a contextual matter relevant to the interpretation of the rule of court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	351	It weighs in favour of a clear and straightforward interpretation which will yield a readily ascertainable starting date . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	352	Entrusting judges with a broad discretionary task of retrospectively assessing when the complaint could first reasonably have been made -LRB- as a prelude to deciding whether the application is time barred -RRB- is antithetical to the context of a time limit barring judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	353	46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	354	Secondly , legal policy favours simplicity and certainty rather than complexity and uncertainty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	355	In the interpretation of legislation this factor is a commonplace consideration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	356	In choosing between competing constructions a court may presume , in the absence of contrary indications , that the legislature intended to legislate for a certain and predictable regime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	357	Much will depend on the context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	358	In procedural legislation , primary or subordinate , it must be a primary factor in the interpretative process , notably where the application of the procedural regime may result in the loss of fundamental rights to challenge an unlawful exercise of power . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	359	The citizen must know where he stands . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	360	And so must the local authority and the developer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	361	For my part this approach is so firmly anchored in domestic law that it is unnecessary , in this case , to seek to reinforce it by reference to the European principle of legal certainty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	362	47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	363	Unfortunately , the judgment in the Greenpeace case and the judgment of the Court of Appeal , although carefully reasoned , do not produce certainty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	364	On the contrary , the proposition in the Greenpeace case , at p 424 , `` that a judicial review applicant must move against the substantive act or decision which is the real basis of his complaint '' leaves the moment at which time starts to run uncertain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	365	This is illustrated by the way in which Laws J in a lengthy judgment proceeded retrospectively to assess the various dates by which the applicants could have applied for judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	366	In a case note published in -LSB- 1998 -RSB- JR 8 on the Greenpeace case , `` All Litigants are Not Equal : Delay and the Public Interest Litigant '' Dr Forsyth -LRB- co-author of the standard text book -RRB- commented , at p 10 , para 8 : `` This obligation resting upon applicants to apply for judicial review as soon as the real basis of their complaint had been identified is onerous and uncertain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	367	It may be pointed out that notwithstanding that he had the luxury of being able to view each event in its proper context as revealed by subsequent events , the judge found it difficult to decide what the precise date was . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	368	How much more difficult must it be for the applicant who lacks this perspective and to whom the significance of each event is obscure to judge when the real basis of their complaint has come to the fore ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	369	In truth , the basis of a complaint is often constructed ex post facto , but the judgment ignores this reality . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	370	Laws J saw it as a matter of the court imposing `` a strict discipline in proceedings before it '' and administering justice `` case by case '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	371	The difficulty with this approach is , however , that it does not provide the relative certainty in respect of the operation of the time limit under Ord 53 , r 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , which a citizen might be entitled to expect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	372	48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	373	While I must avoid distraction from the main point , it is of passing interest that the sequel to the Greenpeace case as decided by Laws J was a decision by Maurice Kay J in the same ongoing dispute in which a rather different approach on a number of public law points prevailed : R v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry , Ex p Greenpeace Ltd -LSB- 2000 -RSB- Env LR 221 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	374	49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	375	There is appended to the appellant 's printed case a list of dates which on the Court of Appeal judgment may be held to be the operative dates even where the challenge is to the grant of planning permission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	376	For my part I would not necessarily be willing to accept the realism of all the suggested dates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	377	But on the reasoning of the Court of Appeal and the arguments of the respondents dates earlier than the resolution -LRB- e g a recommendation to the planning committee -RRB- may in future have to be treated as operative dates . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	378	Indeed , on the rationale of the Court of Appeal judgment , and the argument for the respondents , time could start to run when a planning authority , before the adoption of any resolution , accepted a deficient environmental statement and placed it on the register pursuant to regulation 14 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1988 Regulations . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	379	Almost certainly there will be other potential dates even where the challenge is to the final decisions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	380	Not surprisingly , the practice in the Divisional Court has been inconsistent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	381	There has been criticism in professional journals of the failure of the Court of Appeal in the present case to bring a measure of certainty to this corner of the law : Edwards and Martin , Time gentleman , please , -LRB- 2001 -RRB- Estates Gazette , No 0103 , 20 January 2001 , p 128 ; comment on the Court of Appeal decision by Edwards , -LSB- 2001 -RSB- JPL 775 , 785-786 ; Roots and Walton , `` Promptness and Delay in Judicial Review - an update on the continuing saga '' -LSB- 2001 -RSB- JPL 1360 ; compare also the earlier article of Jones and Phillpot , `` When He Who Hesitates is Lost : Judicial Review of Planning Permissions '' , -LSB- 2000 -RSB- JPL 564 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	382	At present there now appears to be a confusing number of different potential starting points . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	383	They involve the court retrospectively assessing when it was reasonable for an individual to apply for judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	384	The lack of certainty is a recipe for sterile procedural disputes and unjust results . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	385	By contrast if the better interpretation is that time only runs under Ord 53 , r 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , from the grant of permission the procedural regime will be certain and everybody will know where they stand . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	386	50 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	387	Thirdly , the preparation of a judicial review application , particularly in a town planning matter , is a burdensome task . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	388	There is a duty of full and frank disclosure on the applicant : 053/14/57 to RSC Ord 53 , r 14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	389	The applicant must present to the court a detailed statement of his grounds , his evidence , his supporting documents in a paginated and indexed bundle , a list of essential reading with relevant passages sidelined , and his legislative sources in a paginated indexed bundle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	390	This is a heavy burden on individuals and , where legal aid is sought , the Legal Services Commission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	391	The Civil Procedure Rules and Practice Direction - Judicial Review Supplementing Part 54 contain similar provisions : see also the Pre-Action Protocol for Judicial Review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	392	An applicant is at risk of having to pay substantial costs which may , for example , result in the loss of his home . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	393	These considerations reinforce the view that it is unreasonable to require an applicant to apply for judicial review when the resolution may never take effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	394	They further reinforce the view that it is unfair to subject a judicial review applicant to the uncertainty of a retrospective decision by a judge as to the date of the triggering of the time limit under the rules of court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	395	51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	396	For all these reasons I am satisfied that the words `` from the date when the grounds for the application first arose '' refer to the date when the planning permission was granted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	397	In the case before the House time did not run therefore from the resolution of 15 September 1999 but only from the grant of planning permission on 12 May 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	398	It follows that in my view the decisions of Richards J and the Court of Appeal were not correct . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	399	XI . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn

40	401	52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	402	Given the conclusion I have reached it is unnecessary in this case to consider the arguments on European law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	403	And there is no need for a reference to the European Court of Justice pursuant to article 234 of the EC Treaty -LRB- OJ 1992 C 224 , p 6 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	404	XII Promptitude 53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	405	This case has not turned on the obligation of a judicial review applicant to act `` promptly '' under the rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	406	In these circumstances I confine my observations on this aspect to two brief matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	407	First , from observations of Laws J in R v Ceredigion County Council , Ex p McKeown -LSB- 1998 -RSB- 2 PLR1 the inference has sometimes been drawn that the three months limit has by judicial decision been replaced by a `` six weeks rule '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	408	This is a misconception . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	409	The legislative three months limit can not be contracted by a judicial policy decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	410	Secondly , there is at the very least doubt whether the obligation to apply `` promptly '' is sufficiently certain to comply with European Community law and the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms -LRB- 1953 -RRB- -LRB- Cmd 8969 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	411	It is a matter for consideration whether the requirement of promptitude , read with the three months limit , is not productive of unnecessary uncertainty and practical difficulty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	412	Moreover , Craig , Administrative Law , 4th ed , has pointed out , at p 794 : `` The short time limits may , in a paradoxical sense , increase the amount of litigation against the administration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	413	An individual who believes that the public body has acted ultra vires now has the strongest incentive to seek a judicial resolution of the matter immediately , as opposed to attempting a negotiated solution , quite simply because if the individual forbears from suing he or she may be deemed not to have applied promptly or within the three month time limit '' And in regard to truly urgent cases the court would in any event in its ultimate discretion or under section 31 -LRB- 6 -RRB- of the 1981 Act be able to refuse relief where it is appropriate to do so : see Craig , Administrative Law , 4th ed , 794 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	414	The burden in such cases to act quickly would always be on the applicant : see Jones and Phillpot , `` He Who Hesitates is Lost : Judicial Review of Planning Permissions '' -LSB- 2000 -RSB- JPL 564 , at 589 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord slynn, lord steyn

40	427	In my opinion the principle upon which the decision of this House in Lane v Esdaile -LSB- 1891 -RSB- AC 210 proceeded was correctly identified by Lord Esher MR in In re Housing of the Working Classes Act 1890 , Ex p Stevenson -LSB- 1892 -RSB- 1 QB 609 , 611 when he said : `` I am , on principle and on consideration of the authorities that have been cited , prepared to lay down the proposition that , wherever power is given to a legal authority to grant or refuse leave to appeal , the decision of that authority is , from the very nature of the thing , final and conclusive and without appeal , unless an appeal from it is expressly given . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	428	So , if the decision in this case is to be taken to be that of the judge at chambers , he is the legal authority to decide the matter , and his decision is final ; if it is to be taken to be that of the High Court , then they are the legal authority entrusted with the responsibility of deciding whether there shall be leave to appeal , and their decision is final . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	429	In either case there is no appeal to this court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	430	What was said in Lane v Esdaile -LSB- 1891 -RSB- AC 210 supports the view that I am taking . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	431	57 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	432	There is no doubt that this rule was extended in In re Poh 1983 -RSB- 1 WLR 2 when it was applied to an appeal from a refusal of leave to apply for judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	433	I also think that Lord Diplock 's observation , at p 3 , that this House is not concerned with the procedure by which the application in question moved to the Court of Appeal is difficult to reconcile with what was said in Ex p Stevenson . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	434	The fact that the Court of Appeal granted permission to the applicants to appeal from the decision of Richards J shows that the decision of the judge to refuse permission was not treated as final and conclusive and without appeal in that court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	435	58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	436	For these reasons I do not think that there is any sound basis for holding that , where the Court of Appeal has granted leave to appeal against a refusal of permission to apply for judicial review and then heard the appeal , this House has no jurisdiction to entertain a further appeal against a refusal of permission by the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	437	Promptitude 59 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	438	I share my noble and learned friend 's doubt as to whether the provision in CPR r 54.5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- that the claim form must be filed `` promptly '' is sufficiently certain to comply with the right to a fair hearing within a reasonable time in article 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms -LRB- 1953 -RRB- -LRB- Cmd 8969 -RRB- and , in that respect , also with European Community law . 	lord hope	lord steyn	partagr	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	439	But , as his point may have some implications for the law and practice of judicial review in Scotland and as the current state of the law and practice in Scotland might be of some interest if rule 54.5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- were to be reformulated , I should like to add these comments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	440	60 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	441	The principle of legality , which covers not only statute but also unwritten law , requires that any law or rule which restricts Convention rights must be formulated with sufficient clarity to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct : Sunday Times v United Kingdom -LRB- 1979 -RRB- 2 EHRR 245 , 270-271 , paras 47 , 49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	442	He must be able , if need be with appropriate advice , to foresee , to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances , the consequences which a given action may entail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	443	The problem is that the word `` promptly '' is imprecise and the rule makes no reference to any criteria by reference to which the question whether that test is satisfied is to be judged . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	444	61 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	445	As Lord Clyde and Denis Edwards , Judicial Review -LRB- W Green , 2000 -RRB- , para 13.14 point out , there is no specific time-limit for the making of an application for judicial review in Scotland nor is it thought that there is any need for one . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	446	The explanation for the absence of a specific statutory time limit is to be found in the history of the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court of Session which preceded the introduction of a new procedure for judicial review by rule of ourt 260B of the Rules of the Court of Session 1965 -LRB- SI 1965/321 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	447	A full account of it is set out in the opinion of the court in West v Secretary of State for Scotland 1992 SC 385 , 393-401 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	448	It had long been recognised that the Court of Session had jurisdiction to control any excess or abuse of power or a failure to act by an inferior body or tribunal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	449	But this jurisdiction was of little use in practice , as it took so long under the existing procedure to obtain a decision from the court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	450	What was needed , as Lord Fraser of Tullybelton pointed out in Brown v Hamilton District Council 1983 SC -LRB- HL -RRB- 1 , 49 , was a reform of the procedure for obtaining judicial review of decisions by public bodies which would provide litigants in Scotland with ready access to the court for the obtaining of the appropriate remedies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	451	62 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	452	The reforms introduced by rule 260B of the 1965 Rules are now to be found in Chapter 58 of the Rules of the Court of Session 1994 -LRB- 1994 No 1443 -LRB- s 69 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	453	They were essentially procedural in nature . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	454	It was not the intention to narrow the supervisory jurisdiction from what it had previously been . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	455	One aspect of that jurisdiction was that it had never been subject to any specific statutory time limit . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	456	A research study was carried out into the operation in practice of judicial review of administrative action in Scotland by staff at the School of Law at the University of Glasgow . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	457	They concluded that there was no case for the introduction of a strict time limit within which a petition must be brought : `` Judicial Review Research '' , 1996 SLT -LRB- News -RRB- 164-165 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	458	Rule 58.3 of the 1994 Rules , which provides for the making of applications for judicial review , says nothing about the time within which such applications must be made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	459	63 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	460	The principal protection against undue delay in applying for judicial review in Scotland is not to be found therefore in any statutory provision but in the common law concepts of delay , acquiescence and personal bar : see Clyde and Edwards , Judicial Review , para 13.20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	461	The important point to note for present purposes is that there is no Scottish authority which supports the proposition that mere delay -LRB- or , to follow the language of CPR r 54.5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , a mere failure to apply `` promptly '' -RRB- will do . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	462	It has never been held that mere delay is sufficient to bar proceedings for judicial review in the absence of circumstances pointing to acquiescence or prejudice : Singh v Secretary of State for the Home Department 2000 SLT 533 , 536 , para 8 , per Lord Nimmo Smith ; Uprichard v Fife Council 2000 GWD 14-514 , per Lord Bonomy -LRB- Transcript ; para 16 -RRB- Bett Properties v Scottish Ministers 2001 SLT 1131 , 1136G-1137A , paras 9-10 , per Lord Macfadyen , although he reserved his opinion on this point , at p 1137E . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	463	As Lord Nimmo Smith said in the Singh case , at p 536I , none of the cases in Scotland provide support for a plea of unreasonable delay , separate and distinct from a plea of mora , taciturnity and acquiescence , in answer to an application for judicial review . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	464	64 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	465	On the other hand it has repeatedly been acknowledged that applications in such cases should be brought as speedily as possible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	466	Ample support for this approach is to be found in the well-known observations of Lord Diplock in O'Reilly v Mackman -LSB- 1983 -RSB- 2 AC 237 , 280-281 to the effect that the public interest in good administration requires that public authorities and third parties should not be kept in suspense for any longer period than is absolutely necessary in fairness to the person affected by the decision ; see also R v Dairy Produce Quota Tribunal for England and Wales , Ex p Caswell -LSB- 1990 -RSB- 2 AC 738 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	467	But decisions as to whether a petition should be dismissed on the ground of delay are made in the light of the circumstances in which time was allowed to pass . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	468	As Lord President Rodger put it in Swan v Secretary of State for Scotland 1998 SC 479 , 487 : `` It is , of course , the case that judicial review proceedings ought normally to be raised promptly and it is also undeniable that the petitioners let some months pass without starting these proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	469	None the less , in considering whether the delay was such that the petitioners should not be allowed to proceed , we take into account the situation in which time was allowed to pass . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	470	65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	471	In Ex p Caswell -LSB- 1990 -RSB- 2 AC 738 , 749-750 Lord Goff of Chieveley said that he did not think that it would be wise to attempt to formulate any precise definition or description of what constitutes detriment to good administration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	472	As he pointed out , the interest in good administration lies essentially in a regular flow of consistent decisions and in citizens knowing where they stand and how they can order their affairs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	473	Matters of particular importance , apart from the length of time itself , would be the extent of the effect of the relevant decision and the impact which would be felt if it were to be reopened . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	474	These observations , which were made in the context of an application to extend the period under RSC Ord 53 , r 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , are consistent with the Scottish approach to the question whether the application should be allowed to proceed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	475	The question whether the delay amounts to acquiescence or would give rise to prejudice such as to bar the remedy is inevitably one of fact and degree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	476	66 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	477	There is clearly much force in the point which my noble and learned friend makes that the obligation to apply `` promptly '' is , without more , too uncertain to satisfy the requirements of Convention law . 	lord hope	lord steyn	partagr	1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	478	But in my opinion the factors which are relevant to a plea of mora , acquiescence and taciturnity in Scottish practice provide an appropriate context for the taking of decisions on this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	479	They provide a sufficiently clear and workable rule for the avoidance of undue delay in the bringing of these applications , as experience of the operation of judicial review in Scotland has shown . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord slynn, lord steyn
40	480	I do not think that it would be incompatible with his Convention rights for an applicant who must be taken to have acquiesced in the decision which he seeks to bring under review , or whose delay has been such that another interested party may be prejudiced , to be told that his application can not proceed because he has delayed too long in bringing it .
