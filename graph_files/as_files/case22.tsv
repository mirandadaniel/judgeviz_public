22	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	4	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	5	The Association is an unincorporated body whose members are private hire car drivers in Eastbourne . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	6	They pay a joining fee and they pay each year a proportion of the Association 's expenses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	7	Through salaried employees services are provided for the members such as advertising and arranging jobs by telephone or radio contact . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	8	The Association applied for registration and was registered with effect from 1 September 1991 for the purposes of value added tax . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	9	It was not disputed that the Association was making supplies for the purpose of value added tax which exceeded the registration threshhold . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	10	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	11	In August 1994 the constitution of the Association was revised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	12	The Association contended that thereafter it was not making supplies to its members and it applied for its registration to be cancelled under para 13 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of Schedule 1 to the Value Added Tax Act 1994 -LRB- `` The Act '' -RRB- on the basis that it was no longer registerable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	13	The Commissioners refused the application and their decision was upheld by the London VAT Tribunal , set aside by Turner J -LSB- 1996 -RSB- STC 1469 and restored by the Court of Appeal -LSB- 1998 -RSB- STC 669 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	14	The question on this appeal is whether the Association does make taxable supplies to its members in view of the changes to its constitution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	15	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	16	The Act provides that : `` 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- VAT shall be charged on any supply of services made in the United Kingdom , where it is a taxable supply made by a taxable person in the course or furtherance of any business carried on by him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	17	-LRB- 2 -RRB- A taxable supply is a supply of goods or services made in the United Kingdom other than an exempt supply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	18	5 -LRB- 1 -RRB- Schedule 4 shall apply for determining what is , or is to be treated as , a supply of goods or a supply of services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	19	-LRB- 2 -RRB- Subject to any provision made by that Schedule and to Treasury orders under subsections -LRB- 3 -RRB- to -LRB- 6 -RRB- ... -LRB- a -RRB- ` supply ' in this Act includes all forms of supply , but not anything done otherwise than for a consideration ; -LRB- b -RRB- anything which is not a supply of goods but is done for a consideration ... is a supply of services . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	20	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	21	There is no suggestion in this case that if the Association does make a supply for a consideration it is other than a supply of services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	22	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	23	The Act has two other provisions which deal with the position of an Association . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	24	Section 46 empowers the Commissioners to make regulations determining by what persons anything required to be done under the Act is to be done `` where a business is carried on in partnership or by a club , association or organisation the affairs of which are managed by its members or a committee or committees of its members '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	25	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	26	Section 94 provides that : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- In this Act `` business '' includes any trade , profession or vocation ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- Without prejudice to the generality of anything else in this Act , the following are deemed to be the carrying on of a business - -LRB- a -RRB- the provision by a club , association or organisation -LRB- for a subscription or other consideration -RRB- of the facilities or advantages available to its members ; '' 7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	27	The 1994 version of the constitution of the Association provides for the management of the Association to be entrusted to an elected committee which is given power not only to deal with admissions to and expulsion from membership and to determine the contributions of members to the expenses of the Association but also to determine such matters as the number of employees required , to appoint sub-committees for special purposes and generally to manage `` the affairs '' of the Association . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	28	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	29	Many of the articles of the 1994 Constitution repeat what was in the 1991 Constitution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	30	But there are differences deliberately introduced with VAT liability in mind and which the Association submits are not only important but crucial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	31	It is therefore necessary to consider these in some detail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	32	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	33	Thus para 3 of the 1991 Constitution provides that : `` The purposes for which the Association is established are the following : - -LRB- a -RRB- To provide for the members of the Association premises from which there shall be conducted the businesses of the members as independently contracting private car hire drivers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	34	-LRB- b -RRB- To provide by means of wireless telecommunications , telephone and such other means as may from time to time be deemed desirable , such communications network for the advancement of the members ' business as may be appropriate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	35	-LRB- c -RRB- To employ such Manager , telephonist and other staff as may , from time to time , be desirable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	36	-LRB- d -RRB- To conduct for and on behalf of the members from time to time , such negotiations and activities as may be deemed to be in the interests of the members in connection with their said businesses . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	37	-LRB- e -RRB- To do all other things as may from time to time , in the opinion of the Association , or of the Committee of the Association be deemed desirable and opportune for the development of the business interests of the members . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	38	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	39	The Constitution further provides : - `` 23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	40	The Committee shall have power : - -LRB- a -RRB- generally to manage the affairs of the Association in accordance with the rules and bye-laws ; -LRB- b -RRB- to appoint from their number sub-committees for special purposes and to delegate to them any of the powers of the Committee except those of electing and expelling and making , altering or revoking bye-laws '' .

22	41	`` 27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	42	At the Annual General Meeting any member may propose a new rule or bye-law or alteration or deletion of any existing rule or bring before the meeting any subject or proposal which relates to the affairs of the Association , provided that by not less than seven days before the meeting he shall have given the Secretary notice thereof in writing '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	43	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	44	These were replaced in the 1994 Constitution which contains the following paragraphs : `` 3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	45	The purposes for which the Association is established are the following : - -LRB- a -RRB- The employment by the members of such manager telephonist and other staff as may , from time to time , be desirable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord slynn

22	52	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	53	The entire income and property of the Association shall be applied solely towards the promotion of the purposes set out in paragraph 3 above . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	54	No portion shall be paid or transferred to the persons who at any time are or have been members of the Association or to any of them , or to any person claiming through any of them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	55	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	56	-LRB- g -RRB- Each member shall contribute such weekly or other periodical sum as the Committee shall from time to time resolve on account of his Share of the expenses of the Association . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	57	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	58	The Committee shall have power : - -LRB- a -RRB- Generally to manage the affairs of the Association as agents for the members in accordance with the rules and bye-laws ; -LRB- b -RRB- To appoint from their number sub-committees for special purposes and to delegate to them any of the powers of the Committee except those of electing and expelling and making , altering or revoking bye-laws . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	59	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	60	The Committee shall keep all proper and necessary records of all receipts and payments taken or made by them on behalf of the Association or its members and shall present an audited account thereof at the Annual General Meeting and the same shall be at the expense of the members of the Association . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	61	The total expenses of the Association thus ascertained will be divided equally among the members . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	62	Any member who has been a member for only a part of the period covered by the account shall be allocated a rateable proportion of the total epenses computed on a time basis . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	63	At the same time every member will receive a statement of his account with the Association covering the same period in which he will be charged his share of the total expenses and credited with the contributions he has made in accordance with clause 7 -LRB- g -RRB- above . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	64	The balance of each member 's account at the end of the period may be dealt with by reduction or increase or such member 's future contribution or in any other manner at the discretion of the Committee including demand for immediate payment of any debit balance in the books of the Association . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord slynn

22	67	In the Driver 's Rules attached to this Constitution the word ` subscription ' shall be read as if it referred to the contributions on account of expenses described in this Constitution under paragraph 7 -LRB- g -RRB- '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	68	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	69	Other changes may arguably point in the same direction of transferring the business from that of the Association to that of the members . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	70	Thus para 7 -LRB- g -RRB- in 1991 `` Each member shall contribute such weekly or other periodcial sum as the Committee shall from time to time resolve for the purposes of fulfilling the expenses of the Association '' became in 1994 '' -LRB- g -RRB- Each member shall contribute such weekly or other periodical sum as the Committee shall from time to time resolve on account of his share of the expenses of the Association . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	71	I doubt however whether there is any real difference between them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	72	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	73	But Mr Smouha contends that the emphasis in the clauses to which I have referred on the members rather than on the Association fundamentally changes the position in regard to VAT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	74	He further relies on the terms of the `` Statement of Conditions of Service '' under the Employment Protection -LRB- Consolidation -RRB- Act 1978 which is given to employees who normally work 16 hours per week or more . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	75	In that document the employer is stated to be `` each of the members for the time being of Eastbourne Town Radio Cars Association '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	76	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	77	The issue is thus whether that is enough to remove VAT liability from the Association bearing in mind that : `` First , as I have already said , the concept of ` supply ' for the purposes of VAT is not identical with that of contractual obligation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	78	Secondly , in consequence , it is perfectly possible that although the parties in any given situation may conclude their contractual arrangements in writing so as to define all their mutual rights and obligations arising in private law , their agreement may nevertheless leave open to question , what is the nature of the supplies made by A to B for the purposes of A 's assessment of VAT . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	79	In many situations , of course , the contract will on the facts conclude any VAT issue , as where there is a simple agreement for the supply of goods or services with no third parties involved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	80	In cases of that kind there is no space between the issue of supply for VAT purposes and the nature of the private law of contractual obligation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	81	But that is a circumstance , not a rule . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	82	There may be cases , generally -LRB- perhaps always -RRB- where three or more parties are concerned , in which the contract 's definition -LRB- however exhaustive -RRB- of the parties ' private law obligations nevertheless neither caters for nor concludes the statutory question , what supplies are made by whom to whom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	83	Nor should this be a matter for surprise : in principle , the incidence of VAT is obviously not by definition regulated by private agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	84	Whether and to what extent the tax falls to be exacted depends , as with every tax , on the application of the taxing statute to the particular facts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	85	Within those facts , the terms of contracts entered into by the tax - payer may or may not determine the right tax result . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	86	They do not necessarily do so '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	87	-LRB- Commissioners of Customs and Excise v Reed Personnel Services Ltd -LSB- 1995 -RSB- STC 588 , 595 per Laws J -RRB- 15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	88	It is also right to bear in mind the approach of Advocate General Jacobs in H J Glawe Spiel-und Unterhaltungsgeräte Aufstellungsgesellschaft mbH & Co KG v Finanzamt Hamburg-Barmbek-Uhlenhorst -LRB- Case C-38 / 93 -RRB- -LSB- 1994 -RSB- STC 543 , 547 , para 18 , where he said , in relation to a claim that tax was chargeable on the whole amount put into a gaming machine rather than on the net receipt after winnings had been taken : `` that view is inconsistent with the commercial reality of the transaction for all practical purposes the operator 's turnover consists in the amounts he is able to remove from the machine , and not in the total amounts inserted by players '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	89	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	90	The importance of `` the commercial reality , and not straying outside the four corners of the contract '' was also stressed in Commissioners of Customs and Excise v Sinclair Collis Ltd -LSB- 1999 -RSB- STC 701 , 708 , para 7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	91	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	92	If the terms of the 1994 Constitution and the Statement are looked at only as a matter of contract between the various drivers and the employees it may well be that since the Association is not a legal entity the employers would be the various drivers from time to time and the rights and obligations of the drivers would depend only on the contract between them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	93	In such a case the Association would be acting as agent for the drivers ; it would hold property in trust for the drivers and the drivers would be individually or jointly liable to third parties for what they did or what was done on their behalf . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	94	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	95	In the context of liability to register for and to pay VAT , however , the starting point is the provision of section 94 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	96	When an Association provides , for a subscription or other consideration , facilities or advantages available to its members , such provision is `` deemed to be the carrying on of a business '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	97	That does not of itself mean that the Association is automatically making a taxible supply but it does mean that the Association is carrying on a business and can be within the scope of value added tax . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	98	The intention of the Act is plainly that the activities of an Association should not be excluded from VAT merely because it was unincorporated and not a legal person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	99	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	100	It is plain that here there is an ` association ' within the meaning of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	101	If there were any doubt about that it is at least an ` organisation ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	102	The Association has members , a committee and a chairman . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	103	It has rules binding on the members which govern the activities of the Association and its members . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	104	There is provided an infrastructure for the provision of the various services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	105	The Association through its committee controls admissions and the discipline and removal of members . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	106	The Association is empowered to invest money . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	107	Only members of the Association are entitled to benefit from the activity of the Association . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	108	The members pay a joining subscription of # 50 or such other fee as shall be fixed by the Association in general meeting and they also pay a periodical sum fixed by the Association 's committee on account of the members ' share `` of the expenses of the Association '' -LRB- article 7 -LRB- g -RRB- -RRB- In the Drivers ' Rules attached to the Constitution the word `` subscription '' is taken to refer to such contributions on account of expenses -LRB- article 42 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	109	The subscriptions are paid direct to the Association and they do not go to other members who are said to provide the employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	110	A member 's share of the expenses is not calculated on specific services rendered for him -- e.g. in arranging a particular journey -- but on the total expenses for the year divided amongst the members and `` any member who has been a member for only a part of the period covered by the account shall be allocated a rateable proportion of the total expenses computed on a time basis '' -LRB- article 34 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	111	The subscription for 1994 included in each case a higher amount than the allocated share of expenses , the balance to be carried forward to the following year . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	112	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	113	It is to be noted that although the members are said in the statement of conditions of service to be the employer -LRB- which in itself creates difficulties of identification -RRB- the document is signed on behalf of the Association . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	114	Normal working hours are `` likely to be variable as agreed by yourself and the Association '' ; grievance and disciplinary procedures are to be carried out by committee members and members of the Association . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	115	`` The Association does not condone unnotified lateness or absenteeism . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	116	It puts undue pressure on other employees to cover duties , and expense to the Association if a driver has to be used instead '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	117	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	118	It seems to me that the joining subscription and the share of expenses paid constitute consideration for what is done by the Association in engaging staff -LRB- whether as employees of the Association or the members -RRB- on the terms of the Association 's constitition , in providing through the staff engaged the operation of a radio or telephone system to link customers to drivers , in advertising , procuring insurance and otherwise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	119	The Association is reimbursed by the members for the services supplied and there is a direct link between the services and the payment as required by Apple and Pear Development Council v Commissioners of Customs and Excise -LRB- Case 102/86 -RRB- -LSB- 1988 -RSB- STC 221 , 234 , 237 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	120	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	121	This is in my view so even though the sum is fixed annually and not by individual services specifically charged for . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	122	What is done thus constitutes the provision by an association for consideration of facilities or advantages available to members of the Association . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	123	It thus is deemed to be the carrying on of a business by the Association . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	124	In the course of its business the Association makes supplies of services -LRB- section 5 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- -RRB- to its members . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	125	That supply is not an exempt supply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	126	It is therefore a taxable supply -LRB- see section 4 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	127	Since the quantity of such supplies exceeds the threshhold figure for the payment of VAT -LRB- Schedule 1 to the Act -RRB- the Association is required to be registered ; it is therefore a taxable person : section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	128	The circle is thus complete -- there is a taxable supply made by a taxable person in the course or furtherance of a business carried on by the Association . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	129	VAT is chargeable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	130	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	131	It seems to me that this is not simply the provision of services by the Association as an administrative intermediary as the Association contends . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	132	Morevover there is not simply a sharing of expenses between two bodies as in Durham Aged Mineworkers ' Homes Association v Commissioners of Customs and Excise -LSB- 1994 -RSB- STC 553 upon which Mr Smouha strongly relied and the correctness of which decision on its own facts I do not doubt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	133	Nor does this case raise the same issues as those decided by your Lordship 's House in Nell Gwynn House Maintenance Fund Trustees v Commissioners of Customs and Excise -LSB- 1999 -RSB- 1 WLR 174 which reversed the decision of the Court of Appeal -LSB- 1996 -RSB- STC 310 to which the Courts below referred .

22	135	Such a conclusion is not contrary to what was said by Lord Russell of Kilowen in Commissioners of Inland Revenue v His Grace the Duke of Westminster -LSB- 1936 -RSB- AC 1 , 24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	136	On the contrary it is within the letter and spirit of the Act which implements the result intended in the Sixth VAT Directive -LRB- Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1997 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	137	It also fully reflects the commercial reality whatever the drafting changes in the Association 's constitution as to the providing of service for the drivers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	138	It follows that in my opinion in this case the Court of Appeal reached the right conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	139	Whether an unincorporated association or group can in other circumstances achieve the result that VAT is not payable it is not necessary to consider . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	140	Each case has to be looked at on its own facts and circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	141	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	142	Accordingly I would dismiss the appeal . 	lord slynn	self	outcome	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	143	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	144	LORD HOFFMANN 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	145	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	146	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	147	The issue in this case is whether the Eastbourne Town Radio Cars Association -LRB- `` the Association '' -RRB- is for the purposes of VAT a taxable person making taxable supplies of services to its members , who are independent car hire drivers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	148	The Association is unincorporated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	149	It has a constitution which contains a statement of its objects -LRB- the employment by the members of a manager , telephonist and other staff to provide a communications network for putting customers in contact with drivers and ancillary purposes -RRB- , provisions for admission to membership , governance -LRB- by an elected committee -RRB- and subscriptions by periodic payments , subject to adjustment so as to divide the expenses among the members . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	150	The committee have power to make bye-laws for the internal management of the Association , including the terms and conditions on which members may avail themselves of the services provided by the Association . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	151	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	152	Section 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the Value Added Tax Act 1994 provides : `` VAT shall be charged on any supply of goods or services made in the United Kingdom , where it is a taxable supply made by a taxable person in the course or furtherance of any business carried on by him . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	153	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	154	So the issue divides into two . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	155	First , is the Association a taxable person ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	156	Secondly , is it making a taxable supply to its members in the course or furtherance of a business which it carries on ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	157	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	158	There is no doubt that the Association is a person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	159	The term is not defined in the Act but Schedule 1 to the Interpretation Act 1978 provides that `` person '' includes a body of persons corporate or unincorporate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	160	For the purposes of VAT , the question is put beyond doubt by the terms of section 94 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Act , which provides : `` Without prejudice to the generality of anything else in this Act , the following are deemed to be the carrying on of a business - -LRB- a -RRB- the provision by a club , association or organisation -LRB- for a subscription or other consideration -RRB- of the facilities or advantages available to its members ... '' 30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	161	On its face , this provision does no more than deem certain activities to be the carrying on of a business when they might not otherwise be so regarded . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	162	It enables a taxable supply made by a taxable person , which otherwise might have been thought to fall outside section 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- because it was not in the course or furtherance of a business , to be brought within it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	163	It therefore obviously assumes that the provision of facilities by a club etc to its members can amount to a taxable supply by a taxable person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	164	This confirms the construction which the Interpretation Act gives to `` person '' in the term `` taxable person '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	165	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	166	The next stage is to ask whether the Association is not only a person but a `` taxable person '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	167	But this turns out to be linked with the second question about whether the Association is making taxable supplies to its members , because a taxable person is defined as a person who is , or is required to be , registered for VAT -LRB- section 3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- and a person is required to be registered -LRB- subject to a minimum turnover requirement and other immaterial qualifications -RRB- if he is making taxable supplies : see Schedule 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	168	So the critical question is whether the Association is making taxable supplies to its members . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	169	If so , it is a taxable person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	170	In fact , the question may be even narrower , because Mr Smouha -LRB- who appeared for the Association -RRB- said that unless the facilities provided by the persons employed on behalf of the members of the Association were a taxable supply to its members , the consideration for the other facilities would be insufficient to bring the Association within the registration requirement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	171	So the question is whether the Association is making a taxable supply by providing its members with the services of its employees or the right to avail themselves of those services . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	172	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	173	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	174	an unincorporated association is , as I have said , not a legal entity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	175	It is a number of legal persons having mutual rights and duties in accordance with rules which constitute the contract under which they have agreed to be associated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	176	The property of the Association is owned by or on trust for the individual members and subject to the rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	177	The liability of the individual members for the debts incurred for the purposes of the association is governed by the ordinary law of contract and agency . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	178	The rights of the members , as against each other , to avail themselves of the common property and facilities are governed by their contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	179	Nevertheless , Parliament contemplated that such a body could be treated as making supplies to its members . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	180	What did it regard as the badges of such a supply ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	181	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	182	I think that there are two . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	183	First , it is necessary that there should be something which can be described as an association . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	184	Secondly , the facility or service in question must be provided in accordance with the rules of the association and must be in consideration of a payment into the funds of the association . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	185	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	186	The first condition is the existence of an association rather than simply a contractual arrangement for jointly obtaining goods and services and sharing their expense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	187	Durham Aged Mineworkers ' Homes Association v Customs and Excise Commissioners -LSB- 1994 -RSB- STC 553 , much relied upon by Mr Smouha , illustrates an arrangement in the second category . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	188	An association can not be defined by the enumeration of a set of necessary and sufficient conditions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	189	What can be done is to list features which are normally present in an association . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	190	So , for example , it will usually have a set of rules which constitute a mutually binding contract between the members , a statement of its objects and provisions for its governance by a committee or committees , the admission of members and the cessation of membership -LRB- giving the association a continuity beyond its original members -RRB- and provisions -LRB- or a rule-making power -RRB- for the terms and conditions upon which members may enjoy the benefits of membership . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	191	This list of the paradigm characteristics of an association is not intended to be exhaustive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	192	Furthermore , it is perfectly possible for contractual arrangements to lack one or more of these features and still be regarded as constituting an association . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	193	But the further the arrangements depart from those of the standard case , the less likely they are to be treated as an association for the purposes of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	194	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	195	The second condition is to exclude arrangements which are not with members as such but involve the association acting simply as an ordinary third party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	196	For example , if two members of a club ask the wine steward to buy them a case of wine as part of the club 's next order , undertaking to reimburse the cost , there is no supply to the members by the club . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	197	It is simply acting as their purchasing agent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	198	On the other hand , if the club , acting in accordance with its rules , supplies wine out of its own stock to a member in return for payment into the funds of the club , that is a supply by the club to the member : see Carlton Lodge Club v Customs and Excise Commissioners -LSB- 1974 -RSB- STC 507 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	199	And when I say , `` out of its own stock '' , I mean out of wine which is held for the purposes of the club in accordance with its rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	200	It does not matter how or from whom the wine was acquired . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	201	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	202	In my opinion , both conditions are satisfied in the present case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	203	There is an association and the right of any member to the services provided by the employees engaged for the purposes of the association is governed by the rules or by-laws made under the rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	204	He enjoys those services in return for the payment of a subscription into the funds of the association . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	205	37 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	206	Mr Smouha said that what made the difference in the present case was the terms upon which the employees had been engaged and certain features of the constitution . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	207	The contracts of employment stated that the employee was engaged , not on behalf of the association , but on behalf of the members of the association for the time being . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	208	The objects of the association were not the provision of the services of the employees to the members , but the employment by the members of persons to provide such services to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	209	And the payment of subscriptions was on the basis of simply dividing the expenses of the association among the members pro rata in accordance with the time for which they had been members . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	210	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	211	In my opinion these features do not alter the character of the transaction as a supply by the association to the members . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	212	As between the association and its employees , the employer may be a nominated person , the committee , the body of members as a whole . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	213	In the same way , a club 's wine may have been bought by the wine steward , the committee or its chairman -LRB- who may or may not be the member buying a glass at the bar . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	214	All that seems to me quite immaterial . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	215	What matters is that , as between the members , the provision of services to the members is governed by the rules and bye-laws of the association . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	216	Whether or not a member is an employer in relation to an employee , he has no right to the services of that employee except such right as may be conferred by the rules and bye-laws . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	217	Likewise it seems to me immaterial that subscriptions are fixed pro rata by time of membership rather than by the occasions on which services are used or simply per capita or in any other way . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	218	What matters is that the consideration for the member 's entitlement to services under the rules is a payment into the funds of the association in accordance with the rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	219	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	220	Mr Smouha submitted that it was surely conceptually possible for persons in the position of the members of the Association to set up an arrangement which merely amounted to a joint purchase of services , with a central paymaster . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	221	If so , the only question was whether they had succeeded in doing so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	222	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	223	I would not like to engage in the question of whether it is conceptually possible . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	224	That question involves asking whether it can be done without interposing between the employees and the members something which is treated in VAT law as an association and therefore a separate person making supplies to those who receive services by virtue of its rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	225	I do not wish to speculate upon whether complex arrangements for common provision of services can be created without involving an association of the recipients . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	226	It is sufficient that in my opinion the present arrangements clearly do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
22	227	For these reasons , as well as those given by my noble and learned friend , Lord Slynn of Hadley , I would dismiss the appeal . 	lord hoffmann	lord slynn	fullagr	0.9	lord hoffmann, lord slynn
