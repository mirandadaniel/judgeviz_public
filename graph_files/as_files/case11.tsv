11	25	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord rodger
11	26	5 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord rodger
11	27	On 2 October 1998 at Sheffield Crown Court David Cadman Smith -LRB- `` the respondent '' -RRB- pled guilty to count 3 of an indictment alleging fraudulent evasion of excise duty contrary to section 170 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord rodger
11	28	His co-accused , John Anthony Marriott , pled guilty to the same charge . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord rodger
11	29	The respondent was sentenced to 21 months ' imprisonment and a confiscation order was made in the sum of # 46,250 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord rodger
11	30	The respondent appealed against the confiscation order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord rodger
11	31	On 16 June 2000 the Court of Appeal -LRB- Criminal Division -RRB- -LRB- Mance LJ , Newman and Burton JJ -RRB- allowed the appeal and quashed the order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord rodger
11	32	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord rodger
11	33	By letter dated 26 June 2000 the administrator of the chambers of counsel for Her Majesty 's Customs and Excise served on the registrar of the Court of Appeal an application for leave to appeal to this House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord rodger
11	34	The terms of the letter indicated that counsel would be content for the Court of Appeal to deal with the application without an oral hearing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord rodger
11	35	The papers were passed to the members of the Court of Appeal who considered the matter and , on 28 July 2000 , certified that the appeal involved a point of general public importance but refused leave to appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord rodger
11	36	This decision was incorporated into an order dated 31 July 2000 but the order was not despatched or notified to the legal representative of either party until it was sent by second class post on 9 August 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord rodger
11	37	The notice was not received by Customs and Excise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord rodger
11	38	On 21 August their solicitors telephoned the Court of Appeal office to ask about the position in regard to their application . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord rodger
11	39	The office sent a copy of the order . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord rodger
11	40	On the basis that the Court of Appeal had reached their decision on 28 July , the 14-day period for applying to this House for leave expired on 10 August , the day after the second class letter was posted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord rodger
11	41	Because they had not received the order by 10 August , the Crown were unable to exercise their right to apply to this House for leave to appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord rodger
11	42	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord rodger
11	43	The matter was re-listed before the Court of Appeal on 27 November . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord rodger
11	44	Despite the opposition of junior counsel for the respondent , on 20 December the Court of Appeal decided that they had power in the interests of justice to issue a fresh certificate so that the Crown could ask the House for leave to appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord rodger
11	45	The Court of Appeal accordingly certified that the case raised the same point of law of public importance as they had previously certified and again refused the Crown leave to appeal against their decision of 16 June . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord rodger
11	46	In due course , on report from an oral appeal committee , the House gave leave to appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord rodger
11	47	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord rodger
11	48	In his written case the respondent argued that the appeal raised the question whether the Court of Appeal had had jurisdiction to hear a `` renewed '' application for leave to appeal in these circumstances . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord rodger
11	49	At the start of the hearing , however , Mr Emmerson , who appeared for the respondent , explained that he did not propose to argue that matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord rodger
11	50	He pointed out that the Court of Appeal had not certified the question as one of public importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord rodger
11	51	Moreover , in their opinion of 20 December , delivered by Mance LJ , the Court of Appeal had indicated that the court intended to adopt a different procedure which was designed to prevent a similar difficulty occurring in future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord rodger
11	52	In these circumstances , understandably , counsel felt unable to argue that this procedural point was of general importance and therefore one that the House should consider . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord rodger
11	53	He was accordingly content for us simply to deal with the question certified by the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord rodger
11	54	On behalf of the Crown Mr Mitchell adopted a similar position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord rodger
11	55	In these circumstances , your Lordships decided that it would indeed be appropriate to proceed simply on the basis that , in their order of 20 December 2000 , the Court of Appeal had certified a point of public importance on which the House had then granted leave to appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord rodger
11	56	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord rodger
11	57	The point of public importance which the Court of Appeal certified is in these terms : `` Whether an importer of uncustomed goods , who intends not to enter them for customs purposes and not pay any duty on them , derives a benefit under section 74 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 through not paying the required duty at the point of importation , where the goods are forfeited by HM Customs following importation , before their value can be realised by the importer . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord rodger
11	58	The relevant facts which give rise to that issue can be stated fairly briefly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord rodger
11	59	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord rodger
11	60	Between June and November 1997 John Marriott made a number of trips abroad on his own boat to smuggle cigarettes and , on one occasion , spirits into the United Kingdom . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord rodger
11	61	In November 1997 he was arrested and made a full admission . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord rodger
11	62	His boat was confiscated but he was granted bail . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord rodger
11	63	While on bail , he approached the respondent and , it appears , put up # 55,000 with which the respondent bought a motor vessel , The Vertine . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord rodger
11	64	In the words of the judge when imposing sentence , the respondent allowed himself to be used as Marriott 's ship owner and captain . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord rodger
11	65	The Crown did not argue that the respondent himself had put up any of the money to buy the boat . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord rodger
11	66	The boat was used in April 1998 on a run to Heligoland to buy cigarettes and to smuggle them into this country without paying duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord rodger
11	67	On 8 May 1998 the respondent , Marriott and another man , David Russell , set sail once more for Heligoland . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord rodger
11	68	Two days later , on 10 May , they sailed The Vertine , laden with cigarettes , into the Humber estuary , past the customs houses at Immingham and Hull and so on for some 50 miles up the River Ouse until she reached Ocean Lock at the entrance to Goole . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord rodger
11	69	There is no customs house at this point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord rodger
11	70	When the boat arrived at Goole , customs officers stopped and searched her . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord rodger
11	71	They found 1.25 million cigarettes on board . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord rodger
11	72	The excise duty payable on that quantity of cigarettes would have been # 130,666.40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord rodger
11	73	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord rodger
11	74	Part VI of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 -LRB- `` the 1988 Act '' -RRB- , as amended by the Criminal Justice Act 1993 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1995 , contains the statutory provisions dealing with the confiscation of the proceeds of an offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord rodger
11	75	When the possibility of making a confiscation order arises , the court must first determine `` whether the offender has benefited from any relevant criminal conduct '' -LRB- section 71 -LRB- 1A -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord rodger
11	76	Subsections -LRB- 4 -RRB- and -LRB- 5 -RRB- of section 71 provide : '' -LRB- 4 -RRB- For the purposes of this Part of this Act a person benefits from an offence if he obtains property as a result of or in connection with its commission and his benefit is the value of the property so obtained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord rodger
11	77	-LRB- 5 -RRB- Where a person derives a pecuniary advantage as a result of or in connection with the commission of an offence , he is to be treated for the purposes of this Part of this Act as if he had obtained as a result of or in connection with the commission of the offence a sum of money equal to the value of the pecuniary advantage . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord rodger
11	78	In terms of section 102 -LRB- 1 -RRB- `` property '' includes `` money '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord rodger
11	79	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord rodger
11	80	When making the confiscation order against the respondent , the sentencing judge proceeded on the basis that , by evading the duty payable on the cigarettes , the respondent had derived a pecuniary advantage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord rodger
11	81	In terms of subsection -LRB- 5 -RRB- he was therefore to be treated as if he had obtained , as a result of the commission of the offence , a sum of money equal to the duty evaded , viz . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord rodger
11	82	# 130,666.40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord rodger
11	83	In addition , the judge held that , in terms of subsection -LRB- 4 -RRB- , the respondent had obtained The Vertine , worth # 55,000 , in connection with the commission of the offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord rodger
11	84	The judge therefore calculated that , for the purposes of Part VI of the Act , the respondent had benefited to the extent of # 185,666.40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord rodger
11	85	The respondent 's `` realisable property '' -LRB- section 74 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- was limited , however , to an apparent equity in his matrimonial home and the value of another boat which he owned , amounting in total to # 46 , 250 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord rodger
11	86	Applying section 71 -LRB- 6 -RRB- the judge therefore made a confiscation order for the sum of # 46,250 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord rodger
11	87	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord rodger
11	88	In the Court of Appeal counsel for the respondent argued that the judge had erred in holding that the appellant had actually evaded payment of the excise duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord rodger
11	89	Counsel contended that , since the respondent had smuggled the cigarettes and had not made entry of them , duty had not been payable on them in terms of section 43 of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord rodger
11	90	The Court of Appeal rightly rejected this argument by observing that under regulation 4 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the Excise Goods -LRB- Holding Movement , Warehousing and REDS -RRB- Regulations 1992 , the excise duty point was the time when the cigarettes were charged with duty at importation and the duty became payable at that point in terms of regulation 6 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord rodger
11	91	The respondent did not cross-appeal against that determination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord rodger
11	92	While rejecting the respondent 's argument , the Court of Appeal proceeded to allow the appeal on the basis of an argument that had not been advanced to them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord rodger
11	93	They held that , even though he had evaded payment of the duty , the respondent had not derived any pecuniary advantage from doing so and so had not benefited , in terms of section 71 -LRB- 4 -RRB- , from evading the duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord rodger
11	94	The Crown 's appeal to this House against that decision was argued on the agreed basis that , when The Vertine passed the customs posts at Hull and Immingham , the excise duty on the cigarettes had become payable and the respondent had not paid it when the boat reached Goole and the customs officers boarded it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord rodger
11	95	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord rodger
11	96	A number of other matters are not in dispute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord rodger
11	97	The customs officers at Goole seized both the cigarettes and The Vertine which were forfeited to the Crown . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord rodger
11	98	The respondent has never paid the duty on the cigarettes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord rodger
11	99	He remains liable to pay it , however , even though he has been imprisoned for the fraudulent evasion of the duty and even if a confiscation order is made against him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord rodger
11	100	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord rodger
11	101	The nub of the decision of the Court of Appeal , so far as it relates to the evasion of the excise duty , is to be found in paragraphs 34 and 35 of the judgment delivered by Burton J. Having referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal -LRB- Criminal Division -RRB- in R v Dimsey and Allen -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 1 CrAppR -LRB- s -RRB- 497 , Burton J said : `` 34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord rodger
11	102	It appears to us that the position in this case is very different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord rodger
11	103	It is true to say that the liability for duty on the cigarettes was incurred , in the light of our conclusions , and was evaded , and indeed is still due because , although the cigarettes themselves were forfeited , the appellant remains liable to the duty on those forfeited cigarettes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord rodger
11	104	But there was , and is , in the view of this court no benefit to the appellant as a result of that deferment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord rodger
11	105	He has never had or sold on the cigarettes ; he has not retained any sum from which he could be said to have benefited and indeed he now remains liable for the duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord rodger
11	106	In so far as he has not paid over a sum to the Customs and Excise as yet -LRB- for which he remains liable -RRB- , it is , in the view of this court , difficult to say that there has been a benefit in connection with the commission of the offence , and the unpaid duty certainly could not be said , as Laws LJ so persuasively said in R v Dimsey and Allen in relation to the moneys that the appellant retained , to have been the proceeds of the offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord rodger
11	107	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord rodger
11	108	In those circumstances , we are satisfied that the position is that if the cigarettes had been retained by the appellant , then the duty payable would have been part of the profit that he made as a result of selling on the cigarettes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord rodger
11	109	Given that the cigarettes were immediately forfeited , there remained the liability for duty , but the liability which remains can neither be said to be the proceeds of the crime nor indeed a benefit which arises to him in connection with the commission of the crime . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord rodger
11	110	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord rodger
11	111	In essence , the court held that the respondent had not derived any pecuniary benefit , in terms of section 71 -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the 1988 Act , from evading the payment of duty since he remained liable to pay the duty , but had `` never had or sold on '' the cigarettes because they had been seized by the customs officers when they boarded the boat . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord rodger
11	112	The position would have been different if the respondent had been able to sell the cigarettes , since then the duty evaded would have been part of the profit on that sale . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord rodger
11	113	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord rodger
11	114	The reasoning of the Court of Appeal involves a consideration of the fate of the cigarettes : since they were taken from the respondent before he could do anything with them , he could not be said to have derived a pecuniary advantage from evading payment of the duty on them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord rodger
11	115	That is not , however , by any means the only possible analysis of the situation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord rodger
11	116	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord rodger
11	117	Suppose that a captain had sailed his boat laden with cigarettes into the Humber and had stopped at Hull to pay the excise duty before going on to Goole where , before the cigarettes could be unloaded , the boat sank , making the waterlogged cigarettes unsellable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord rodger
11	118	The captain would not only have lost the cigarettes but would have paid the duty , which would not be recoverable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord rodger
11	119	Suppose , on the other hand , that , undetected by any Customs officers , the captain had sailed past the customs posts without paying the duty and had gone on to Goole where the ship sank and the cigarettes were ruined . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord rodger
11	120	All that he would have lost would have been the cigarettes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord rodger
11	121	So , even though the cigarettes were subsequently destroyed , by evading payment of the duty , the captain would be better off , or less badly off , than if had paid the duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord rodger
11	122	I would respectfully adopt the view of Laws LJ in R v Dimsey and Allen at p 500 , that `` the ordinary and natural meaning of pecuniary advantage must surely include the case where a debt is evaded or deferred . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord rodger
11	123	In the example which I have given , therefore , the captain would have derived a pecuniary advantage from evading payment of the excise duty , even though the cigarettes were subsequently spoiled . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord rodger
11	124	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord rodger
11	125	In the same way , it can be said that the respondent derived a pecuniary advantage when he evaded payment of the excise duty on the cigarettes at the customs posts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord rodger
11	126	This remains the case even though the cigarettes were seized by the customs officers when they boarded the boat at Goole . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord rodger
11	127	In my view , this analysis of the circumstances in which a smuggler derives a `` pecuniary advantage '' in terms of section 21 -LRB- 5 -RRB- is to be preferred to that of the Court of Appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord rodger
11	128	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord rodger
11	129	Laws LJ 's interpretation of `` pecuniary advantage '' as including the case where a debt is evaded or deferred was based on his view of the ordinary and natural meaning of the words . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord rodger
11	130	He went on to find support for that view in the observations of Lord Reid in R v Turner -LSB- 1974 -RSB- AC 357 on the meaning of the same words where they appeared in section 16 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- of the Theft Act 1968 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord rodger
11	131	Mr Emmerson analysed the history of that provision in considerable detail , in order to show why the observations of Lord Reid in R v Turner should be regarded as an unsafe guide to the meaning of the phrase in the 1988 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord rodger
11	132	On the other hand , Mr Mitchell for the Crown did not cite R v Turner in support of his argument . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord rodger
11	133	Since , like Laws LJ , I consider that evading or deferring a debt falls within the scope of the ordinary and natural meaning of deriving a `` pecuniary advantage '' , I find it unnecessary to consider R v Turner when interpreting the words in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord rodger
11	134	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord rodger
11	135	When considering whether to make a confiscation order , the court must first determine whether the offender has benefited from any relevant criminal conduct -LRB- section 71 -LRB- 1A -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord rodger
11	136	Subsections -LRB- 4 -RRB- and -LRB- 5 -RRB- of section 71 , which are closely linked , show how the court is to go about this task . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord rodger
11	137	Subsection -LRB- 4 -RRB- is the general provision which explains when , for the purposes of subsection -LRB- 1A -RRB- , a person benefits from an offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord rodger
11	138	He benefits if he obtains `` property '' as a result of , or in connection with , the commission of the offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord rodger
11	139	The measure of his benefit is the value of the property so obtained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord rodger
11	140	Since `` property '' includes `` money '' -LRB- section 102 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- , subsection -LRB- 4 -RRB- covers the case where the offender obtains money as a result of , or in connection with , the commission of an offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord rodger
11	141	Subsection -LRB- 5 -RRB- , on the other hand , deals with the situation where the offender derives a `` pecuniary advantage '' as a result of or in connection with the commission of an offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord rodger
11	142	Under subsection -LRB- 5 -RRB- , such a person is to be treated as if he had obtained a sum of money equal to the value of the pecuniary advantage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord rodger
11	143	Since `` a sum of money '' is `` property '' , he is in effect treated as having obtained `` property '' and , for that reason , in terms of subsection -LRB- 4 -RRB- , he has benefited from the offence : the benefit is the sum of money that is equal to the value of the pecuniary advantage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord rodger
11	144	By treating persons who derive a pecuniary advantage as persons who have obtained property , Parliament has indicated that , for the purposes of confiscation orders , the same approach is to be applied to both types of offender . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord rodger
11	145	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord rodger
11	146	In terms of subsection -LRB- 4 -RRB- the measure of the offender 's benefit is the value of the property which he obtains . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord rodger
11	147	Section 74 -LRB- 5 -RRB- and -LRB- 6 -RRB- provide : '' -LRB- 5 -RRB- References in this Part of this Act to the value at any time -LRB- referred to in subsection -LRB- 6 -RRB- below as ` the material time ' -RRB- of any property obtained by a person as a result of or in connection with the commission of an offence are references to - -LRB- a -RRB- the value of the property to him when he obtained it adjusted to take account of subsequent changes in the value of money ; or -LRB- b -RRB- where subsection -LRB- 6 -RRB- below applies , the value there mentioned , whichever is the greater .

'' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord rodger
11	149	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord rodger
11	150	These provisions show that , when considering the measure of the benefit obtained by an offender in terms of section 71 -LRB- 4 -RRB- , the court is concerned simply with the value of the property to him at the time when he obtained it or , if it is greater , at the material time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord rodger
11	151	In particular , where the offender has property representing in his hands the property which he obtained , the value to be considered is the value of the substitute property `` but disregarding any charging order '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord rodger
11	152	Except , therefore , where the actual property obtained by the offender has subsequently increased in value , the court is simply concerned with its value to the offender `` when he obtained it '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord rodger
11	153	It therefore makes no difference if , after he obtains it , the property is destroyed or damaged in a fire or is seized by customs officers : for confiscation order purposes the relevant value is still the value of the property to the offender when he obtained it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord rodger
11	154	Subsequent events are to be ignored , in just the same way as any charging order is to be ignored under subsection -LRB- 6 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord rodger
11	155	Such a scheme has the merit of simplicity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord rodger
11	156	If in some circumstances it can operate in a penal or even a draconian manner , then that may not be out of place in a scheme for stripping criminals of the benefits of their crimes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord rodger
11	157	That is a matter for the judgment of the legislature , which has adopted a similar approach in enacting legislation for the confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord rodger
11	158	In that context the courts have consistently held that `` payments '' received in connection with drug trafficking mean gross payments rather than net profit and that the `` proceeds '' of drug trafficking mean the gross sale proceeds , rather than the net profit after deducting the cost of the drug trafficking operation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord rodger
11	159	I give two examples by way of illustration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord rodger
11	160	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord rodger
11	161	R v Smith -LRB- Ian -RRB- -LSB- 1989 -RSB- 1 WLR 765 concerned a confiscation order under the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord rodger
11	162	The Court of Appeal had to consider what was meant by `` payments or other rewards '' received by the appellant in connection with drug trafficking -LRB- section 2 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord rodger
11	163	Lord Lane CJ said , at p 769 : `` The words ` any payments ' are on the face of them clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord rodger
11	164	They must mean , indeed it is clear from the wording , any payment in money or in kind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord rodger
11	165	It does not mean , in the judgment of this court , net profit derived from the payment after the deduction of expenses , whether the expenses are those of purchase , travelling , entertainment or otherwise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord rodger
11	166	The same consideration applies to the words ` other rewards ' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord rodger
11	167	They also have to be valued . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord rodger
11	168	If for example the receiver of the drugs had rewarded the appellant by providing him with an expensive holiday or an expensive motor car , it would not , we think , be legitimate to construe the words ` value of the rewards ' as meaning value of the holiday or motor car less the business expenses involved in earning the reward . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord rodger
11	169	It seems to us that the section is deliberately worded so as to avoid the necessity , which the appellant 's construction of the section would involve , of having to carry out an accountancy exercise , which would be quite impossible in the circumstances of this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord rodger
11	170	It may be that the wording is draconian , and that it produces a draconian result . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord rodger
11	171	But it seems to us that if that is the case , it was a result intended by those who framed the Act . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord rodger
11	172	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord rodger
11	173	In R v Banks -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 2 CrApp -LRB- s -RRB- 110 the applicant submitted that the sentencer had been wrong to assess the value of the proceeds of his drug trafficking on the basis of his gross receipts as opposed to his actual profits . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord rodger
11	174	Giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal and rejecting that argument , Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ said , at p 116 : `` All these provisions are in our judgment directed to trying to stamp on the transfer of funds which have been used for the purposes of financing drug trafficking . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord rodger
11	175	It would in our judgment reduce those provisions to absurdity if the expression ` proceeds ' were to be read as applying only to profits made from drug trafficking and to leave parties free to bank or transfer or conceal or disguise sums which are the product of drug trafficking but which do not represent profits . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord rodger
11	176	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord rodger
11	177	If , then , the value of property obtained as a result of or in connection with the commission of an offence is simply the value of the property to the offender when he obtained it , even if it is subsequently destroyed , damaged or forfeited , one would expect the same general approach to apply in the case of a pecuniary advantage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord rodger
11	178	And indeed subsections -LRB- 4 -RRB- and -LRB- 5 -RRB- of section 71 of the 1988 Act produce that result . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord rodger
11	179	As I have already noted , the combined effect of those subsections is that the offender who has derived a pecuniary advantage from his offence is treated as a person who has obtained `` property '' as a result of or in connection with the commission of the offence , the `` property '' in question being a sum of money equal to the value of the pecuniary advantage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord rodger
11	180	Under section 74 -LRB- 5 -RRB- for the purposes of making a confiscation order the value of the property is its value to the offender when he obtained it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord rodger
11	181	In this case the respondent derived a pecuniary advantage by evading the duty at the moment when he imported the cigarettes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord rodger
11	182	The sum equalling that pecuniary advantage is treated as property obtained by the respondent at that moment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord rodger
11	183	In terms of section 74 -LRB- 5 -RRB- , its value must therefore be determined at that moment , disregarding the fact that , soon after , the customs officers seized the cigarettes at Goole . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord rodger
11	184	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord rodger
11	185	That being so , the fact that the respondent and his co-accused were unable to realise the value of the contraband cigarettes is irrelevant to the question of whether they derived a pecuniary advantage from fraudulently evading the excise duty on them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord rodger
11	186	If the cigarettes had not been seized and the respondent and his co-accused had been able to sell them , then the money which they received from selling them would have been `` property '' in terms of section 71 -LRB- 4 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord rodger
11	187	In that situation , they would not only have derived a pecuniary advantage in terms of section 71 -LRB- 5 -RRB- from evading the duty but would also have obtained property in terms of section 71 -LRB- 4 -RRB- in the form of the sales receipts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord rodger
11	188	Their benefit from the commission of the offence would have been made up of these two elements . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord rodger
11	189	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord rodger
11	190	Mr Emmerson sought to support the approach of the Court of Appeal to the application of section 71 -LRB- 5 -RRB- by arguing that the question of whether an offender had derived a pecuniary advantage from his offence was a question of fact , to be determined in the particular circumstances of each case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord rodger
11	191	In some cases - for example , where the contraband goods were sold - the position would be clear . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord rodger
11	192	The same might apply where someone smuggled in a Cartier watch and subsequently wore it for some months . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord rodger
11	193	In this case , however , where the customs officers had forfeited the cigarettes as soon as the boat reached Goole , it was impossible to say that the respondent had derived any pecuniary advantage whatever from evading the duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord rodger
11	194	Apart from all the other difficulties , this approach introduces a degree of uncertainty that is out of place in the application of a penal provision of this kind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord rodger
11	195	This was highlighted by counsel 's understandable reluctance to indicate how long the respondent would have had to have the cigarettes after evading payment of the duty before he could be said to have derived a pecuniary advantage from his offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord rodger
11	196	Would a day have been enough ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord rodger
11	197	Or a week ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord rodger
11	198	The test to be applied in answering such a question is altogether obscure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord rodger
11	199	For this reason alone , the approach advocated by Mr Emmerson would be unworkable and must be rejected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord rodger
11	200	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord rodger
11	201	I am accordingly satisfied that the decision of the Court of Appeal on this point was wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord rodger
11	202	It is worth adding that , if adopted , their interpretation would go a long way to making the confiscation provisions ineffective against smugglers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord rodger
11	203	After all , there will be few , if any , cases where customs officers will fail to seize contraband goods which they find in the hands of smugglers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord rodger
11	204	The decision of the Court of Appeal would mean that in any such case , for the purposes of section 71 -LRB- 5 -RRB- , the smugglers would derive no pecuniary benefit from evading the excise duty and so no confiscation order could be made against them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord rodger
11	205	Fortunately , the terms of the legislation do not lead to that result . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord rodger
11	206	30 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord rodger
11	207	I would accordingly allow the appeal of the Crown and hold that the respondent derived a pecuniary advantage to the value of # 130,666.40 as a result of fraudulently evading the excise duty on the cigarettes . 	lord rodger	self	outcome	0.9	lord rodger
11	208	On that basis I would restore the order of the Crown Court dated 22 July1999 making a confiscation order in the sum of # 46,250 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord rodger
11	209	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord rodger
11	210	In their judgment the Court of Appeal touched only briefly on a further issue which `` was hardly pursued '' by counsel for the Crown in the proceedings before them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord rodger
11	211	This related to the value of The Vertine which had been purchased in the respondent 's name with moneys provided by Marriott . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord rodger
11	212	The argument for the Crown was that this was property which the respondent had obtained in connection with the commission of the offence . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord rodger
11	213	The Court of Appeal held that , even if the respondent had obtained any such benefit , he no longer had it at the date of the confiscation order since The Vertine had been forfeited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord rodger
11	214	Mr Emmerson did not seek to support this aspect of the reasoning of the Court of Appeal , which is plainly inconsistent with the terms of sections 71 -LRB- 4 -RRB- and 74 -LRB- 5 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord rodger
11	215	Not surprisingly , in view of the lack of prominence given to the issue before them , the Court of Appeal did not certify it as one of public importance and the House did not give leave to appeal in respect of it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord rodger
11	216	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord rodger
11	217	Nonetheless during the hearing Mr Mitchell argued that the respondent had obtained the boat in connection with the commission of the offence and that he had accordingly benefited to the extent of its value . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord rodger
11	218	Since I would allow the appeal and restore the confiscation order for # 46,250 , which exhausts the respondent 's realisable assets , this point is entirely academic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord rodger
11	219	In these circumstances I would say only this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord rodger
11	220	Even on the Crown approach , it was not entirely clear , on the available evidence , what the value of the boat would have been to the respondent at the time when he obtained it -LRB- section 74 -LRB- 5 -RRB- -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord rodger
11	221	For that reason I should not be taken as necessarily accepting the Crown 's submission that the respondent had obtained property worth # 55,000 to him by virtue of the transaction involving The Vertine . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord rodger
