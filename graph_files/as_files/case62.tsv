62	2	LORD BINGHAM OF CORNHILL 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
62	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
62	4	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
62	5	I would dismiss this appeal for the reasons given by my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann , whose opinion I have had the advantage of reading in draft and whose summary of the facts and the relevant legislation I gratefully adopt and need not repeat . 	lord bingham	lord hoffmann	fullagr	0	lord hoffmann

62	5	I would dismiss this appeal for the reasons given by my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann , whose opinion I have had the advantage of reading in draft and whose summary of the facts and the relevant legislation I gratefully adopt and need not repeat . 	lord bingham	lord hoffmann	factagr	0	lord hoffmann
62	6	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
62	7	Since the Trade Disputes Act 1906 , trade unions and their officials have enjoyed a measure of immunity from actions against them by employers based on the tort of inducing breaches of contract by employees . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
62	8	But the immunity has never been , and is not now , unqualified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
62	9	Under the law as it now stands , immunity is enjoyed only if the inducement is an act done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute -LRB- Trade Union and Labour Relations -LRB- Consolidation -RRB- Act 1992 , section 219 -RRB- and only if the breach induced has the support of a properly conducted ballot -LRB- 1992 Act , sections 226-234 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
62	10	This appeal raises issues concerning both these qualifications . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
62	11	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
62	12	The first issue turns on the definition of a trade dispute in section 244 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1992 Act as meaning -LRB- so far as relevant -RRB- `` a dispute between workers and their employers which relates wholly or mainly to ... -LRB- a -RRB- terms and conditions of employment ... '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
62	13	It is plain that most disputes between employers and employees which lead to strike action or industrial action short of a strike fall squarely within this definition however it is construed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
62	14	One might instance disputes about rates of pay ; ancillary benefits such as paid holidays , sick pay or pensions ; working hours ; overtime ; rostering and shift patterns ; and so on . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
62	15	In such situations , the employers or the employees -LRB- or their representatives -RRB- are seeking a change in some aspect of the employment relationship between them , whether strictly contractual or not , which the other party is resisting , and the action is taken to put pressure on the other party to accede . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
62	16	In such a case , if the ordinary processes of negotiation and collective bargaining break down , the inducement of breaches of contract -LRB- save in excepted employments , and subject to the balloting requirements -RRB- is not unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
62	17	So much is agreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
62	18	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
62	19	But Mr Giffin , for the appellant P , contended that the statutory definition of trade dispute covers nothing other than a dispute about terms and conditions of employment , giving that expression the broad meaning favoured by Lord Denning MR in British Broadcasting Corporation v Hearn -LSB- 1977 -RSB- 1 WLR 1004 at 1010 ; -LSB- 1977 -RSB- ICR 685 at 692 and approved by the House in Hadmor Productions Ltd v Hamilton -LSB- 1983 -RSB- 1 AC 191 at 227 , 233-234 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hoffmann
62	20	I was for a time attracted by this argument , which was skilfully deployed and appeared to reflect the language of the statute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	21	But I am persuaded that such a construction would be too narrow and would deny protection to genuine , employment-related disputes between employers and employees which have in the past been thought to be protected and ought in fairness to be so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	22	Suppose , for example , an employer introduced a new machine or a new working schedule , as the employer was in principle entitled to do , but which his employees resisted on the ground that the machine was potentially dangerous or the new working schedule too onerous . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	23	There could be no doubt of the employer 's duty to take reasonable care not to expose his employees to danger or to excessive stress , and it would accordingly be artificial to regard such a dispute as one about the terms and conditions of their employment , even on a broad construction of that expression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	24	It would in truth be a dispute about the job the employees were required to do , a matter going to the very heart of the employment relationship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	25	I would accordingly read the statutory definition as covering a genuine dispute between employees and their employer relating wholly or mainly to the job the employees are employed to do or the terms and conditions on which they are employed to do it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	26	If this test is applied to the facts of the present case , as summarised by my noble and learned friend , it is plain that the dispute between the teaching staff and the governing body as their employers related directly to the job the teachers were required to do and were unwilling to do , which was to teach P. 5 . 	lord bingham	lord hoffmann	partagr	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	27	The crux of the second issue , relating to the ballot , is whether the ballot was invalidated -LRB- and the trade union 's entitlement to immunity thereby lost -RRB- because the union failed to treat two of its members at the school , of whose existence it learned after ballot papers had been sent out but before the conclusion of the balloting process , as persons entitled to vote . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	28	At first blush , one would expect the union 's unintentional failure , which did not affect the result of the ballot , to be exonerated under section 232B . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	29	But section 232A is not one of the provisions listed in section 232B -LRB- 2 -RRB- , which refers only to sections 227 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , 230 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and 230 -LRB- 2A -RRB- , with the result that a breach of section 232A can not be excused under section 232B . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	30	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	31	It has been common ground between the parties throughout that the reference to section 230 -LRB- 2A -RRB- in section 232B makes no sense . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	32	Morison J inferred , reasonably enough , that the reference to section 230 -LRB- 2A -RRB- in section 232B was intended to be a reference to section 232A , since when spoken both sound the same -LRB- judgment , paragraph 25 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	33	The Court of Appeal -LRB- -LSB- 2001 -RSB- ICR 1241 -RRB- saw the force of this point -LRB- judgment of Waller LJ , paragraph 59 -RRB- but invited further argument , as a result of which it became clear -LRB- and was accepted by both sides -RRB- that the reference in section 232B -LRB- 2 -RRB- should have been , not to section 230 -LRB- 2A -RRB- , but to section 230 -LRB- 2B -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	34	Thus the House has the unenviable task , as did the courts below , of attempting to construe this complicated series of provisions with knowledge that they contain at least one blatant error . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	35	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	36	In the present case , the number of union members at the school was relatively small and it would not have been unduly onerous for the union both to establish with accuracy who was entitled to vote and also to ensure they received ballot papers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	37	But these statutory provisions would apply equally to industrial action to be undertaken by thousands or tens of thousands . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	38	It would be absurd if an immaterial and accidental failure to send a ballot paper to a single member were to invalidate the ballot , so as to deprive the union of immunity , and this contingency is provided for by sections 230 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and 232B . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	39	But it would be equally absurd if an immaterial and accidental failure to establish with accuracy who was entitled to vote were to invalidate the ballot so as to deprive the union of immunity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	40	It is inconceivable that Parliament intended these 1999 amendments to the 1992 Act to have that result . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	41	The House must attempt to give the provisions a likely and workable construction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	42	In my opinion , the construction advanced by my noble and learned friend achieves that result , and I also would adopt it . 	lord bingham	lord hoffmann	partagr	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	43	I would however hope , an error on the face of the statute having been exposed , that remedial legislative action may be taken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	44	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	45	LORD HOFFMANN 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	46	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	47	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	48	The appellant was a pupil at a voluntary aided school in inner London . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	49	He is subject to an order prohibiting disclosure of his identity and I shall call him P . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	50	The teachers found him disruptive in class and violent and abusive in the playground . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	51	On 6 June 2000 the headmaster directed that he should be permanently `` excluded '' , i e expelled , from the school . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	52	He appealed to the governors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	53	On 30 June 2000 they directed that he be reinstated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	54	So the headmaster instructed the teachers to take him back into their classrooms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	55	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	56	P went back to school and returned again after the summer holidays . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	57	At the end of the new academic year he was due to take his GCSEs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	58	But , after further incidents of disruption in the autumn term , some of the teachers complained to their union , the National Association of School Masters / Union of Women Teachers -LRB- `` NASUWT '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hoffmann
62	59	They said that they should not be required to go on teaching him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	60	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	61	On 6 November 2000 the NASUWT gave notice to the governors , as the teachers ' employers , that they intended to ballot their members at the school over whether they should strike or take industrial action short of a strike in furtherance of their objection to having to teach P . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	62	The giving of such notice is the opening shot in the series of steps which a union must take before it can lawfully call upon its members to take industrial action : see section 226A of the Trade Union and Labour Relations -LRB- Consolidation -RRB- Act 1992 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	63	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	64	On 14 November 2000 the union head office sent out ballot papers to 35 members . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	65	In fact there were 32 members teaching at the school but two had recently joined from other schools and the union had not been notified of their change of employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	66	The union 's representative at the school told head office some time before 16 November that two members had been left out but by then the ballot papers had been distributed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	67	The closing date for returning them to head office was the first post on 22 November . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	68	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	69	The result of the ballot was that 26 members voted in favour of industrial action , described as not accepting `` the unreasonable direction of the head teacher , acting under the instructions of the Governing Body , made in accordance with the Teachers ' Pay and Conditions Document , to teach a certain pupil . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	70	None voted against . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	71	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	72	The Teachers ' Pay and Conditions Document contains the statutory conditions of employment of school teachers in the public sector . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	73	They are given effect by statutory instrument made by the Secretary of State pursuant to section 2 of the School Teachers ' Pay and Conditions Act 1991 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	74	In November 2000 the conditions in force were those annexed to the Education -LRB- School Teachers ' Pay and Conditions -RRB- -LRB- No. 3 -RRB- Order 2000 -LRB- SI 2000/2321 -RRB- , which came into force on 1 September 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	75	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	76	The professional duties of teachers -LRB- other than head teachers -RRB- are set out in paras 56-59 of the Document . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	77	Para 56 says in general terms that a teacher shall carry out his professional duties `` under the reasonable direction of the head teacher '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	78	Para 57 says that he shall perform `` in accordance with any directions which may reasonably be given to him by the head teacher ... such particular duties as may reasonably be assigned to him . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	79	His professional duties are described in para 58 and they include -LRB- 58.1.2 -RRB- `` teaching ... the pupils assigned to him '' and -LRB- 58.7 -RRB- `` maintaining good order and discipline among the pupils . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	80	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	81	If , therefore , it was reasonable for the head teacher to direct the teachers to teach P , their industrial action in refusing to do so would have been a breach of their conditions of employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	82	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	83	After holding the ballot , the union wrote on 24 November to all its members at the school , including the two who had not received ballot papers , instructing them to take industrial action from 1 December 2000 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	84	After that date the teachers refused to teach P in their classes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	85	The head teacher arranged for him to sit in a separate room under the supervision of a supply teacher and do work which the other teachers had set for him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	86	There is a dispute over whether this arrangement was better or worse for his educational progress . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	87	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	88	On 19 March 2001 P commenced an action against the NASUWT pursuant to section 235A of the 1992 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	89	This gives a statutory cause of action to an individual who claims that a trade union '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- a -RRB- ... has done , or is likely to do , an unlawful act to induce any person to take part ... in industrial action , and -LRB- b -RRB- an effect , or a likely effect , of the industrial action is or will be to ... -LRB- ii -RRB- reduce the quality of ... services supplied to the individual making the claim '' Subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- says that for the purposes of the section , inducing a person to take part in industrial action is unlawful if it is `` actionable in tort by any one or more persons . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	90	The remedy available under section 235A is an injunction requiring the union to call off the industrial action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	91	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	92	The action was tried by Morison J on the basis of written witness statements without cross-examination . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	93	There was , as I have said , a dispute over whether the new regime under which P was taught did in fact reduce the quality of services with which he was supplied but the judge did not find it necessary to decide the point . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	94	Nor did he decide whether or not the direction of the headmaster requiring the teachers to teach P was reasonable or not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	95	If it was unreasonable , the teachers would not have been in breach of their conditions of employment and the industrial action would for that reason not have been unlawful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	96	On the other hand , from the headmaster 's point of view it must have been reasonable for him to give effect to the directions of the governors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	97	At any rate , the judge was willing to assume in favour of P that the industrial action was in breach of contract and that it reduced the quality of teaching which he received . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	98	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hoffmann
62	99	On those assumptions , the case turned upon whether the industrial action was protected by section 219 of the 1992 Act : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- An act done by a person in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute is not actionable in tort on the ground only - -LRB- a -RRB- that it induces another person to break a contract ... -LRB- 4 -RRB- -LSB- Subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- has -RSB- effect subject to ... section 226 -LRB- requirement of ballot before action by trade union -RRB- ... '' 20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	100	This section gives rise to two issues . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	101	The first is whether the industrial action was `` in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	102	The second is whether the statutory requirements for a ballot were complied with . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	103	The judge and the Court of Appeal decided both issues in favour of the union . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	104	P appeals to your Lordships ' House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	105	Since the decision of the Court of Appeal he has taken his GCSEs and left the school . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	106	But your Lordships have heard the appeal because it raises a point of general public importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	107	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	108	First , the trade dispute issue . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	109	A `` trade dispute '' is elaborately defined in section 244 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	110	The relevant parts of the definition are : `` In this Part a ` trade dispute ' means a dispute between workers and their employer which relates wholly or mainly to one or more of the following - -LRB- a -RRB- terms and conditions of employment , or the physical conditions in which any workers are required to work ; -LRB- c -RRB- allocation of work or the duties of employment between workers or groups of workers . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	111	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	112	The union argued that the dispute related to -LRB- 1 -RRB- their terms and conditions of employment -LRB- having to comply with the head teacher 's direction to teach P -RRB- , -LRB- 2 -RRB- the physical conditions in which they were required to work -LRB- with a disruptive person physically present in the classroom -RRB- and -LRB- 3 -RRB- the allocation of work between teachers -LRB- allocating P to union members -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	113	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	114	Morison J found for the union on -LRB- 1 -RRB- but rejected -LRB- 2 -RRB- and -LRB- 3 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	115	The Court of Appeal , in a judgment given by Waller LJ , agreed with the judge on -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 3 -RRB- but expressed no view on -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	116	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	117	In my opinion this was plainly a dispute over terms and conditions of employment , which I regard as a composite phrase chosen to avoid arguments over whether something should properly be described as a `` term '' or `` condition '' of employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	118	It is sufficient that it should be one or the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	119	Furthermore , the use of such a composite expression shows that it was intended to be given a broad meaning : see Roskill LJ in British Broadcasting Corporation v Hearn -LSB- 1977 -RSB- 1WLR 1004 , 1015 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	120	25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	121	In the present case , it seems to me that the dispute was about the contractual obligation of the teachers to teach P . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	122	It could be characterised as a dispute over whether there was such a contractual obligation : the union , as we have seen , contended that the head teacher 's direction was unreasonable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	123	Alternatively it could be characterised as a dispute over whether there should be such a contractual obligation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	124	It does not seem to me profitable to try to analyse it one way or the other . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	125	The dispute arose because the head teacher said that the teachers were obliged to teach P and they said that they were not willing to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	126	That seems to me a dispute which does not merely `` relate to '' but is about their terms and conditions of employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	127	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	128	Mr Giffin , who appeared for P , submitted that `` terms and conditions '' of employment '' meant the rules which governed the employment relationship . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	129	They need not be written out in the contract of employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	130	In Hearn 's case Lord Denning MR said , at p 1010 , that `` Terms and conditions of employment may include not only the contractual terms and conditions but those terms which are understood and applied by the parties in practice , or habitually , or by common consent , without ever being incorporated into the contract . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	131	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	132	But whether the rules are expressly agreed or implied from custom and practice , Mr Giffin says that they must be rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	133	The nature of a rule , he said , is that it is a normative statement at some level of generality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	134	In the present case , there was a rule that teachers should comply with the directions of the headmaster . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	135	A dispute over whether they should teach P was not a dispute about the rule but about the application of the rule . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	136	It might possibly have been formulated as a dispute about terms and conditions of employment if the union had claimed that the rule should be changed to provide that `` teachers should comply with the directions of the headmaster -LRB- except that they should not be required to teach P -RRB- . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	137	But the union never said that this was what they wanted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hoffmann
62	138	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	139	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	140	I do not think that Parliament could have intended the immunities conferred upon trade unions in industrial disputes to turn upon such fine distinctions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	141	It is in my opinion impossible in this context to formulate a coherent distinction between a rule and the application of the rule to particular cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	142	A dispute about what the workers are obliged to do or how the employer is obliged to remunerate them , at any level of generality or particularity , is about terms and conditions of employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	143	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	144	The main authority upon which Mr Giffin relied for his proposition was the actual decision of the Court of Appeal in Hearn 's case , which was subsequently approved by this House in Hadmor Productions Ltd v Hamilton -LSB- 1983 -RSB- 1 AC 191 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	145	In Hearn 's case , union members working for the BBC threatened to refuse to transmit its television signal to a satellite over the Indian Ocean during the Cup Final because the satellite broadcast would be receivable in , among many other countries , South Africa . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	146	The refusal was pursuant to a union policy of opposing apartheid and on the ground that , as Mr Peter Hain said in a letter of 22 April 1977 to the Director-General of the BBC , `` the screening of the Cup Final will give considerable satisfaction to the sports loving white population .

62	149	The Court of Appeal granted an interlocutory injunction restraining the industrial action on the ground that it was not in furtherance of a trade dispute . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	150	They gave brief unreserved judgments . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	151	Lord Denning MR said that the threat of industrial action was `` coercive interference and nothing more '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	152	It had nothing to do with terms and conditions of employment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	153	It did not become a trade dispute merely because the workers were threatening to break their contracts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	154	The work involved in transmitting the broadcasts was not what the dispute was about . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	155	Roskill and Scarman LJJ agreed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	156	31 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	157	The decision was , if I may respectfully say so , correct because the dispute did not relate to anything which the workers were called upon to do . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	158	They would have had to do exactly the same things if South Africa had not been among the countries from which the satellite broadcast was receivable . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	159	Unlike the teachers in this case , who objected to having to teach P , the BBC workers had no complaint about any aspect of their work . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	160	The objection was simply that one result of their work would be to give pleasure in South Africa . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	161	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	162	I can find nothing in the case which supports a distinction between a rule and a particular application of the rule . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	163	Mr Giffin relied upon the following observations of Lord Denning MR , at p 1011 : `` To become a trade dispute , there would have to be something of the kind which was discussed in the course of argument before us : ` We would like you to consider putting a clause in the contract by which our members are not bound to take part in any broadcast which may be viewed in South Africa because we feel that is obnoxious to their views and to the views of a great multitude of people . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	164	We would like that clause to be put in , or a condition of that kind to be understood . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	165	If the BBC refused to put in such a condition , or refused to negotiate about it , that might be a trade dispute . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	166	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	167	Mr Giffin says that this shows that a trade dispute must be about a rule . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	168	But in my opinion Lord Denning 's remarks were intended to suggest a way in which the concept of a trade dispute might be extended to include disputes over matters which did not concern what the workers had to do or how the employer had to remunerate them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	169	It was not intended to prevent disputes which were over such matters from being trade disputes unless they were formulated in terms of rules . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	170	In Universe Tankships Inc of Monrovia v International Transport Workers Federation -LSB- 1983 -RSB- 1 AC 366 , 392 Lord Cross of Chelsea cautioned against taking Lord Denning 's tentative observations too far : `` A trade union can not turn a dispute which in reality has no connection with terms and conditions of employment into a dispute connected with terms and conditions of employment by insisting that the employer inserts appropriate terms into the contracts of employment into which he enters . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	171	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	172	The point does not seem to have surfaced in subsequent cases and your Lordships may therefore well leave it there . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	173	Mr Giffin draws attention to the fact that the scope of the protection for industrial action was narrowed after Hearn 's case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	174	But the only relevant change is that a trade dispute must `` relate wholly or mainly '' to terms and conditions of employment and must not merely be `` connected '' with them : Mercury Communications Ltd v Scott-Garner -LSB- 1984 -RSB- Ch 37 , 75 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	175	But in my opinion the narrower requirement is entirely satisfied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	176	To say that the dispute was related to terms and conditions of employment is , if anything , inadequate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hoffmann
62	177	Terms and conditions of employment are what the dispute was about . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	178	It is therefore unnecessary to say anything about the other phrases in the definition of a trade dispute on which the union placed reliance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	179	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	180	The other point concerns the validity of the ballot . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	181	This depends upon an examination of some complicated provisions in the 1992 Act : `` 226 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann

NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	193	-LRB- 2 -RRB- The provisions are section 227 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , section 230 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and section 230 -LRB- 2B -RRB- . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	194	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	195	While the statutory provisions may be complicated , Mr Giffin 's argument is simple . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	196	By section 226 -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- bb -RRB- , industrial action does not have the support of a ballot if there has not been compliance with section 232A . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	197	That section says that it will not have that support if the specified conditions apply in the case of any person . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	198	Mr Giffin says that those conditions do apply in respect of the two who did not receive ballot papers : they were members of the union at the time the ballot was held , it was reasonable at that time for the union to believe that they would be induced to take part in industrial action , they were not accorded entitlement to vote in the ballot and they were in fact induced to take part in the industrial action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	199	It is true that the omission to accord them entitlement to vote was accidental in the sense that they were not intentionally denied a right to vote ; there was simply an omission to send them ballot papers because they were not recorded as being employed at that school . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	200	And their votes would have made no difference to the result . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	201	But Mr Giffin says that section 232A is not one of the sections to which the small accidental failures exception in section 232B applies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	202	Section 232A says expressly that failure to comply in respect of any person prevents the action from having the support of a ballot . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	203	Sections 232A and 232B were inserted into the 1992 Act by Schedule 3 , paras 8 and 9 of the Employment Relations Act 1999 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	204	In the usual hopeless attempt to obtain guidance from parliamentary debates under the rule in Pepper v Hart -LSB- 1993 -RSB- AC 593 , your Lordships were referred to the remarks of the Secretary of State Mr Byers at the Report stage in the House of Commons shortly before midnight on 30 March 1999 -LRB- Hansard -LRB- HC Debates -RRB- , col 988 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	205	He said that the purpose of the provisions was to ensure that the parties could concentrate on resolving a dispute `` rather than being bogged down in detailed discussions about whether the complexity of the present procedures has been followed in all its forms . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	206	Whatever else may be said about the amending legislation , it did not reduce complexity . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	207	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	208	In my opinion the key provision in section 232A is , for present purposes , condition -LRB- c -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	209	Is it the case that the two members were not accorded entitlement to vote in the ballot ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	210	For this purpose , one must consider what counts as being accorded entitlement to vote . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	211	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	212	Before the 1999 amendments , the concept of being accorded entitlement to vote was already being used in section 227 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	213	That provided that entitlement to vote must be accorded equally to all members of the union whom it was reasonable to believe would be induced to take part in the industrial action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	214	Subsection -LRB- 2 -RRB- , which was repealed by the 1999 Act , provided : `` The requirement in subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- shall be taken not to have been satisfied if any person who was a member of the trade union at the time when the ballot was held and was denied entitlement to vote in the ballot is induced by the union to take part ... in the industrial action . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	215	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	216	Here too , there were no exceptions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hoffmann
62	217	No one may be denied entitlement to vote . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	218	So the previous legislation also raised the question of what counted as being accorded entitlement to vote , or not being denied entitlement to vote . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	219	In particular , does the fact that one has not been sent a ballot paper mean that one has not been accorded entitlement to vote ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	220	If it did , then failure to send any person a ballot paper would have invalidated the ballot . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	221	41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	222	The answer to this question may be found in section 230 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , which provides that `` so far as is reasonably practicable '' every person who is entitled to vote must be sent a ballot paper . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	223	That provision in my opinion shows that , if it was not reasonably practicable , the omission to send a ballot paper to a person entitled to vote does not amount to a denial of his entitlement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	224	Otherwise there would be no point in the qualifying words `` so far as is reasonably practicable '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	225	The ballot would have complied with section 230 -LRB- 2 -RRB- but would nevertheless have been invalidated by section 227 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	226	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	227	Mr Giffin accepted this argument to the extent of agreeing that failure to receive a ballot paper does not necessarily mean that one has not been accorded entitlement to vote . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	228	It would have been sufficient , he said , if the names of the two members had been included in a list of the names of members whom the union regarded as belonging to the constituency to whom ballot papers should be sent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	229	Then , if it had not been reasonably practicable to send them papers , or now -LRB- by virtue of section 232B -RRB- if that omission was accidental , that would not have detracted from the fact that , by inclusion on the list , they had been accorded entitlement to vote . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	230	In the present case , however , the names of the two members had not been included in any list of those entitled to vote . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	231	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	232	In my opinion there is no requirement in the statute for a list to be drawn up . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	233	Section 227 -LRB- 1 -RRB- defines the constituency who must be accorded entitlement to vote , both positively and negatively . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	234	The constituency must include all members whom it is reasonable for the union to believe will be induced to take part in the industrial action and it must not include any others : see London Underground Ltd v National Union of Railwaymen , Maritime and Transport Staff -LSB- 1996 -RSB- ICR 170 , 178 , per Millett LJ . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	235	Furthermore , entitlement to vote must be accorded equally , with no members having any special privileges . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	236	But what counts as being accorded entitlement to vote must in my opinion be discovered from the other provisions of the Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	237	Section 227 -LRB- 1 -RRB- does not impose the additional requirement of doing some other unspecified act like drawing up a list . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	238	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	239	Sections 228-230 contain the provisions which deal with the conduct of the ballot . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	240	In my opinion , compliance with these provisions in respect of the constituency identified by section 227 -LRB- 1 -RRB- means that the members of that constituency have been accorded entitlement to vote . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	241	In the case of the distribution of ballot papers , section 230 -LRB- 2 -RRB- makes those requirements subject to the proviso of reasonable practicability and section 232B makes both sections 227 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and 230 -LRB- 2 -RRB- subject to the disregard of small accidental errors . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	242	If failure to send a ballot paper to a person within the constituency falls within either of these exceptions , he is not by reason of that failure to be treated as having not been accorded entitlement to vote . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	243	45 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	244	I do not think that the concept of being accorded entitlement to vote in section 232A -LRB- c -RRB- was intended to mean something different from what it meant in section 227 before the amending legislation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	245	As it seems to me clear that , before the 1999 Act , section 227 would have been treated as satisfied , I do not think that the negative condition in section 232A -LRB- c -RRB- should now be treated as satisfied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	246	46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	247	Mr Giffin said that giving section 232A -LRB- c -RRB- this construction would mean that section 232A made no difference to the previous law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	248	That may be right . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	249	The only clue to what section 232A was meant to do is in paragraph 137 of the Explanatory Notes to the Employment Relations Act 1999 , a final and consolidated version of the Notes published during the passage of the Bill through Parliament : see the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn in R -LRB- Westminster City Council -RRB- v National Asylum Support Service -LSB- 2002 -RSB- UKHL 38 ; -LSB- 2002 -RSB- 1 WLR 2956 , 2957 - 2959 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	250	It says of the new provision : `` This will enable unions to induce members who changed job after the ballot to take action . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	251	This suggests that it was previously doubtful whether it was lawful to induce industrial action by members of the union who , because they were not working for the relevant employer and therefore not reasonably contemplated at the time of the ballot as falling within the constituency defined by section 227 , had not been included in the ballot . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	252	47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	253	The argument that inducing such members would not have been lawful had the support of a dictum of Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR in Post Office v Union of Communication Workers -LSB- 1990 -RSB- ICR 258 , 268 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	254	But this dictum was -LRB- in my respectful opinion rightly -RRB- disapproved by the Court of Appeal in London Underground Ltd v National Union of Railwyamen , Maritime and Transport Staff -LSB- 1996 -RSB- ICR 170 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	255	It is true that the Court of Appeal confined its disapproval to the case of persons whom it is not reasonable for the union to believe will be induced to take part because they are not at the time of the ballot members of the union . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hoffmann
62	256	It said nothing about cases in which they were not at the time of the ballot working for the relevant employer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
62	257	The Explanatory Notes suggest that the purpose of section 232A was to close this perceived gap . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
62	258	But in my opinion the logic of the decision in the London Underground case must apply equally whether the reason why the union has not balloted a person afterwards induced to take part in industrial action is because he was not a member or because he was a member but not working for the relevant employer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
62	259	In either case , it would not have been reasonable for the union to believe at the time of the ballot that he would be induced to take part . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
62	260	48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
62	261	If this means that Parliament enacted superfluous legislation , it would not be the first time . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
62	262	It is certainly more likely than that Parliament intended , at one and the same time , by section 232B to create a proviso for some accidental errors and by section 232A to deprive the union of protection from liability in the case of the accidental error most likely to occur , namely an omission to include a member in the ballot paper mailing list . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
62	263	49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
62	264	For these reasons , which are substantially the same as those given by Waller LJ in the Court of Appeal , I think that the industrial action had the protection of a ballot . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
62	265	For the sake of completeness I should add that I do not think that it matters which particular time is meant by `` the time of the ballot '' in section 227 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and `` the time when the ballot was held '' in section 232A -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
62	266	The question is whether , looking at the balloting process as a whole , the two members were denied -LRB- or not accorded -RRB- entitlement to vote . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
62	267	50 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann

62	285	I add some comments of my own on the two issues -LRB- the trade dispute issue and the ballot issue -RRB- because of their importance and interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
62	286	The Trade Dispute Issue 54 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
62	287	For almost a century Parliament has recognised that strikes , overtime bans and other actions taken in the course of an industrial dispute call for special legislative treatment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
62	288	The legislation has had a tortuous history . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
62	289	Lord Scarman -LRB- speaking in 1979 about trade union and employment legislation enacted in 1974 and 1975 -RRB- observed in NWL Ltd v Woods -LSB- 1979 -RSB- 1 WLR 1294 , 1311 : `` It is wrong to attempt to construe any section or subsection of these Acts without reference to their legislative purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
62	290	And it is also necessary to have regard to the history of the statute law and the case law since 1906 for a full understanding of them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
62	291	This history I would summarise as a shifting pattern of Parliamentary assertions and judicial responses -- a legal point counter-point which has been more productive of excitement than of harmony . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
62	292	55 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
62	293	The shifting pattern can be clearly seen in the statutory definition of `` trade dispute '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
62	294	The first and simplest definition was in section 5 -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the Trade Disputes Act 1906 : `` any dispute between employers and workmen , or between workmen and workmen , which is connected with the employment or non-employment , or the terms of the employment , or with the conditions of labour , of any person '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hoffmann
62	295	56 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	296	So from the first `` trade dispute '' was defined -LRB- as Lord Diplock put it in NWL Ltd v Woods , at p 1301 -RRB- by reference to -LRB- i -RRB- the parties to it and -LRB- ii -RRB- the subject matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	297	Originally the requisite nexus between the subject matter and the dispute was the relatively undemanding formula `` in connection with '' , a form of words which continued through the changing legislation until an important amendment first made in 1971 , then reversed in 1974 , and finally restored by section 18 of the Employment Act 1982 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	298	This imposed the more demanding test that the dispute should `` relate wholly or mainly to '' subject matter falling within the statutory definition . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	299	The application of this test requires the court `` to consider not merely the occasion which caused the dispute to break out but also the reason why there was a dispute '' : -LRB- see Dillon LJ in Mercury Communications Ltd v Scott-Garner -LSB- 1984 -RSB- Ch 37 , 97 on section 29 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1979 , as amended -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	300	Dillon LJ then gave some examples from reported cases and continued : `` Indeed , rather than asking what the dispute is about , which can produce a variety of answers of different degrees of helpfulness , it is better to turn the question round , and , having isolated ` fear of job losses ' as the only factor within section 29 relied on by the union , to ask ` Is this dispute wholly or mainly about fear of job losses ? ' '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	301	57 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	302	In the Industrial Relations Act 1971 -LRB- which had a short and controversial life -RRB- the subject matter of an industrial dispute -LRB- the term used in that Act for a trade dispute -RRB- was by section 167 -LRB- 1 -RRB- extended -LRB- or at any rate particularised -RRB- so as to include suspension from and termination of employment , allocation of work and procedure agreements -LRB- an obsolete term which need not be considered further -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	303	It also recast the basic elements of the definition in the Trade Disputes Act 1906 , the first specified subject matter being '' -LRB- a -RRB- Terms and conditions of employment , or the physical conditions in which any workers are required to work '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	304	It is clear that `` conditions '' was here being used in two distinct senses , since the expression `` terms and conditions of employment '' was defined as the terms and conditions on which workers are employed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	305	That definition was not reproduced in the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 , but the two senses of `` conditions '' were carried forward to section 29 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of that Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	306	`` Terms and conditions of employment '' is to be widely construed -LRB- Hadmor Productions Ltd v Hamilton -LSB- 1983 -RSB- 1 AC 191 , 227 -RRB- and it is best construed as a single composite expression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	307	58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	308	Whether there is a trade dispute is a mixed question of fact and law , but -LRB- as Sir John Donaldson MR said in Mercury Communications Ltd v Scott-Garner -LSB- 1984 -RSB- Ch 37 , 75 -RRB- primarily one of fact . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	309	It is a question to be decided objectively , whereas the question whether action is taken in furtherance of a trade dispute is subjective : see the decisions of this House in Express Newspapers Ltd v McShane -LSB- 1980 -RSB- AC 672 , and , less than two months later , Duport Steels Ltd v Sirs -LSB- 1980 -RSB- 1 WLR 142 -LRB- in which the House made some important observations about the need for even-handed judicial interpretation of controversial legislation in this field -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	310	59 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	311	That is the background to the provisions now in force , which are to be found in Part V -LRB- Industrial Action -RRB- of the Trade Unions and Labour Relations -LRB- Consolidation -RRB- Act 1992 -LRB- `` the 1992 Act '' -RRB- as amended . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	312	My noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann has summarised all the relevant provisions but I will set out in full the definition in section 244 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of `` trade dispute '' -LRB- for the purposes of Part V -RRB- : `` a dispute between workers and their employer which relates wholly or mainly to one or more of the following -- -LRB- a -RRB- terms and conditions of employment , or the physical conditions in which any workers are required to work ; -LRB- b -RRB- engagement or non-engagement , or termination or suspension of employment or the duties of employment , of one or more workers ; -LRB- c -RRB- allocation of work or the duties of employment between workers or groups of workers ; -LRB- d -RRB- matters of discipline ; -LRB- e -RRB- a worker 's membership or non-membership of a trade union ; -LRB- f -RRB- facilities for officials of trade unions ; and -LRB- g -RRB- machinery for negotiation or consultation , and other procedures , relating to any of the above matters , including the recognition by employers or employers ' associations of the right of a trade union to represent workers in such negotiation or consultation or in the carrying out of such procedures . '' 	lord walker	lord hoffmann	partagr	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	313	60 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	314	It is important to note that the dispute must relate wholly or mainly to one or more of the topics identified in paragraphs -LRB- a -RRB- to -LRB- g -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	315	Those paragraphs are not mutually exclusive categories . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	316	The statutory definition has emerged in a piecemeal way and some of the later paragraphs seem to have been added only for the avoidance of doubt . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	317	The additions should not be used to narrow the wide natural meaning of the expressions in paragraph -LRB- a -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	318	61 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	319	I respectfully agree with Lord Hoffmann that in this case it is really quite clear that the dispute was about the teachers ' terms and conditions of employment . 	lord walker	lord hoffmann	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	320	That expression can not sensibly be restricted to a dispute which proceeds at some relatively high level of generality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	321	The Ballot Issue 62 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	322	Statutes dealing with employment , trade unions and labour relations are of the highest social importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	323	Parliament 's objective is to frame such statutes in language which is unambiguous and capable of being understood by the members of the general public who may not have ready access to legal advice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	324	This appeal shows that unfortunately that objective is sometimes imperfectly achieved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	325	The need to avoid ambiguity may actually pull against ready understanding , and sometimes the statutory text -LRB- especially when amended either in the course of the legislative process or by later statutes -RRB- seems to fall between two stools . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	326	That is , I fear , true of the provisions dealing with ballots in Part V of the 1992 Act , as amended by the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993 -LRB- `` the 1993 Act '' -RRB- and the Employment Relations Act 1999 -LRB- `` the 1999 Act '' -RRB- , with which your Lordships are concerned on this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	327	63 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	328	The provisions in question have been set out at length in the speech of Lord Hoffmann . 	lord walker	lord hoffmann	partagr	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	329	I draw attention to three particular difficulties on which your Lordships have heard a good deal of debate : -LRB- 1 -RRB- What is `` entitlement to vote '' and how is it `` accorded '' within the meaning of section 227 -LRB- 1 -RRB- of the 1992 Act ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	330	-LRB- 2 -RRB- What was the legislative purpose of replacing section 227 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1992 Act by section 232A -LRB- added , together with section 232B , by the 1999 Act -RRB- ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	331	-LRB- 3 -RRB- What points or periods of time are referred to by `` at the time of the ballot '' in section 227 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and `` at the time when the ballot was held '' in section 232A -LRB- a -RRB- -LRB- and , by reference , -LRB- b -RRB- -RRB- ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	332	64 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	333	In a parliamentary or local government election entitlement to vote is determined in the first place by statutory rules -LRB- in terms of nationality , age , residence and so on -RRB- and in the second place by an electoral roll , carefully prepared in accordance with detailed statutory procedures and then standing as a definitive record of entitlement until the next roll is prepared . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	334	The class of persons entitled to vote in a parliamentary or local government election -- the constituency of the poll -- is therefore defined by an official list of names . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hoffmann
62	335	But there is no close parallel with a ballot held under Part V of the 1992 Act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	336	65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	337	Every trade union is required by law to maintain a register of its members -LRB- see section 24 of the 1992 Act -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	338	But it is a fact of life that no trade union of any size can keep completely full and accurate records of the names and addresses of its ever-changing body of members , still less their current places of work , trade categories and pay grades -LRB- see for instance the evidence summarised in London Underground Ltd v National Union of Rail , Maritime and Transport Workers -LSB- 2001 -RSB- ICR 647 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	339	It is comparatively rare for a large union to call out on strike every one of its members . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	340	In practice , as in this case , the decision is often to call out members employed at a particular workplace where a dispute arises , or members in a particular job . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	341	As Millett LJ said , by way of explanation of section 227 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , in the earlier case of London Underground Ltd v National Union of Railwaymen , Maritime and Transport Staff -LSB- 1996 -RSB- ICR 170 , 178 : `` If the union intends to call out signalmen but not train drivers , the signalmen must be balloted ; the train drivers must not '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	342	Where that happens the constituency for the necessary ballot is most naturally described in those terms ; in this case , NASUWT members employed at the B school . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	343	As the agreed statement of facts and issues puts it -LRB- para 10 -RRB- the union `` intended to ballot all its members at B school '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	344	66 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	345	In theory the union should have been able to produce from its computerised records a printout showing all its members at the B school . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	346	In practice it produced a list which was reasonably accurate but not wholly accurate : it included the names of five teachers who had by then moved on , and it omitted the names of two teachers who had joined the school staff , in each case without letting the union know about their moves . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	347	The inaccurate printout was in practice the source of the error in distributing ballot papers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	348	But there is nothing in the statutory provisions , or in the way in which the union 's head office seems to have acted , to indicate that the printout was intended to be definitive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	349	Had either of the recently-joined teachers rung up the head office to protest at non-receipt of a ballot paper , the answer might have been , `` It is too late to do anything about it '' but it would not have been `` You are not entitled to vote '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	350	The printout was not a definitive document like an electoral roll . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	351	67 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	352	This tentative analysis is , I think , given support by the absence of any statutory requirement for a union to send to the employer anything like an electoral roll of those who are to be balloted and -LRB- if the ballot goes in favour of industrial action -RRB- to be called out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	353	On the contrary section 226A -LRB- 3A -RRB- of the 1992 Act , as amended by the 1999 Act , specifically disentitles the employer from a list of names , for reasons which appear from the judgment of Sir Thomas Bingham MR -LRB- on section 226A in the original form in which it was inserted by the 1993 Act -RRB- in Blackpool and the Fylde College v National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education -LSB- 1994 -RSB- ICR 648 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	354	68 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	355	Mr Giffin -LRB- in the reply which concluded his clear and well-informed submissions -RRB- described this approach as confusing two distinct elements -LRB- entitlement to vote and opportunity to vote -RRB- and as leading to ludicrous consequences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	356	To my mind it does not confuse entitlement with opportunity : on the contrary , it distinguishes these two elements . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	357	Nor does it lead to the result -LRB- which would indeed be ludicrous -RRB- that a union , having decided to call out all its members at a particular workplace , could then deliberately withhold ballot papers from those members at the workplace whom its officers suspected of being opposed to industrial action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	358	Any such action would be a clear breach of section 230 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and would not be saved by either limb of the `` belt and braces '' exceptions -LRB- that is the words `` so far as is reasonably practicable '' in section 230 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and the provisions of section 232B -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	359	69 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	360	In approaching the second problem -LRB- the legislative purpose of sections 232A and 232B -RRB- I start , therefore , from the proposition that if a union intends to call out a class of its members -LRB- here members employed at the B school -RRB- then that class , defined in that way , is the constituency . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	361	The union expects to be able to identify precisely the members in the constituency and give them all the opportunity to vote but it is apparent that this objective may not be achieved for a number of reasons : -LRB- i -RRB- inaccurate records ; -LRB- ii -RRB- further moves of members to or from the school staff while the ballot process is prepared and takes place ; -LRB- iii -RRB- -LRB- although unlikely on the facts of this case -RRB- moves in or out of union membership during that period ; and -LRB- iv -RRB- mistakes happening during the ballot process -LRB- such as letters getting lost on the way to the post , or in the post -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	362	70 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	363	Section 227 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the 1992 Act provided as follows until repealed by the 1999 Act : `` The requirement in subsection -LRB- 1 -RRB- shall be taken not to have been satisfied if any person who was a member of the trade union at the time when the ballot was held and was denied entitlement to vote in the ballot is induced by the union to take part or , as the case may be , to continue to take part in the industrial action '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	364	This provision reproduced -LRB- in almost identical language -RRB- section 11 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Trade Union Act 1984 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	365	In British Railways Board v National Union of Railwaymen -LSB- 1989 -RSB- ICR 678 , 683 , Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR said of this provision : `` Simplifying that a little bit and reading it with section 11 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , which defines who is qualified and entitled to vote , section 11 -LRB- 2 -RRB- is saying ` If you do not allow somebody to vote , if you say `` You are not entitled to vote , '' then you can not call him out on strike . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	366	He has not had an opportunity to express his view , and , if you do call him out on strike , then the whole ballot fails and the strike or other industrial action can not be justified . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	367	Nobody has suggested that anybody entitled to vote has been disqualified from voting . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	368	What Mr Carr says is that if they were not given an opportunity of voting they were denied their entitlement to vote . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	369	I disagree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	370	There is a profound difference , as I think , between denying someone 's entitlement to vote and inadvertently failing to give him an opportunity to vote '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	371	71 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	372	At the beginning of the appeal hearing I was inclined to the view that the purpose of the introduction of section 232A was to remove the strong significance which Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR placed on the word `` denied '' , and that the purpose of section 232B was to give statutory force and clarification to a reference to the de minimis principle referred to by Lord Donaldson in another case , Post Office v Union of Communication Workers -LSB- 1990 -RSB- ICR 258 , 268 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	373	I remain of the view that the purpose of section 232B is to extend the limited protection for innocent and immaterial errors in balloting procedure contained in the 1992 Act in its original form . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hoffmann
62	374	I have however altered my view about section 232A . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
62	375	72 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
62	376	In my view its main purpose was to replace section 227 -LRB- 2 -RRB- with a provision on the same general lines -LRB- that is , spelling out the consequences of any non-compliance with section 227 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- but in such a way as to take account of the complications identified by Millett LJ in the first case of London Underground Ltd v National Union of Railwaymen , Maritime and Transport Staff -LSB- 1996 -RSB- ICR 170 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
62	377	Millett LJ focussed on changes in union membership ; he did not -LRB- because of the facts of that case -RRB- focus on changes in an employee 's workplace -LRB- not accompanied by any change in the identity of the employer or the nature of the employee 's job -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
62	378	Section 232A -LRB- b -RRB- has the effect of covering both points , whereas section 227 -LRB- 2 -RRB- did not -LRB- at any rate expressly -RRB- cover both . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
62	379	Section 232A -LRB- c -RRB- uses the rather odd expression `` not accorded '' in place of `` denied '' but I am not satisfied that that was intended to mark a significant change of effect . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
62	380	If Parliament had intended such a change , it would have made its intention clearer , especially as the side note to the amending provision -LRB- Schedule 3 , para 8 -RRB- of the 1999 Act referred to `` denial '' of entitlement to vote . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
62	381	73 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
62	382	For these reasons I consider that the two teachers who had not told their union about their new employment at the B school were not persons who were `` not accorded entitlement to vote '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
62	383	The error made in their case fell within section 230 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , to which section 232B does apply . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
62	384	The ballot issue was raised on behalf of the appellant only on the morning of the hearing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
62	385	Had it been raised at an earlier stage , the judge would probably have had fuller evidence about this aspect of the matter . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
62	386	As it is , the only fair conclusion is that any defect in the ballot can be disregarded under one or both of the exceptions to section 230 -LRB- 2 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
62	387	74 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
62	388	On that approach the third problem , the point or period of time referred to in sections 227 -LRB- 1 -RRB- and 232A , ceases to be of critical importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
62	389	The fact that Parliament has not used the precise expression `` date of the ballot '' -LRB- defined in section 246 -RRB- suggests that the period of the ballot process , rather than a single date , is the intended meaning . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
62	390	If -LRB- as I think -RRB- paragraph -LRB- c -RRB- of section 232A is concerned with the deliberate denial of voting rights to any union member who would naturally be within the appropriate constituency , there is no reason not to give paragraphs -LRB- a -RRB- and -LRB- b -RRB- a wide scope . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
62	391	75 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hoffmann
62	392	For these reasons and for the fuller reasons stated in the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann I would dismiss this appeal . 	lord walker	lord hoffmann	fullagr	1	lord hoffmann
