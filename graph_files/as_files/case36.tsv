36	2	LORD SLYNN OF HADLEY 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	3	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	4	1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	5	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	6	I fully agree with my noble and learned friend Lord Woolf that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons he gives . 	lord slynn	lord woolf	fullagr	0	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	6	I fully agree with my noble and learned friend Lord Woolf that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons he gives . 	lord slynn	self	outcome	0	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	7	His analysis of the case law and the principles involved to my mind makes two things in particular abundantly clear . 	lord slynn	lord woolf	partagr	0	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	8	The first is that the jurisdiction recognised in Norwich Pharmacal Co v Customs and Excise Commissioners -LSB- 1974 -RSB- AC 133 to order disclosure of , inter alia , the identity of a source of information or documents does not depend on whether the person against whom the order is sought has committed a tort , a breach of contract or other civil or criminal wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	9	It is sufficient but , it is important to stress , also necessary that that person should be shown to have `` participated '' or been `` involved '' in the wrongdoing which is at the basis of the application for discovery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	10	2 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	11	This latter requirement together with the residual discretion of the court as to whether it is right that an order should be made in all the circumstances provide a safeguard against an unjustified order for discovery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	12	No one can or should forget the importance of the freedom of the press but it is plain as article 10 of the European Convention for the protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms -LRB- 1953 -RRB- and section 10 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 require , that there are restrictions which are to be accepted as necessary in a democratic society . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	13	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	14	The second point is that it is not a necessary precondition of the exercise of the jurisdiction that the applicant should have begun , or had an intention to begin , legal proceedings in respect of the allegedly wrongful act -- in cases like these against the source . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	15	My noble and learned friend 's reference to the speeches in British Steel Corp v Granada Television Ltd -LSB- 1981 -RSB- AC 1096 and in particular to the judgments of Lord Denning MR , at p 1127 , and of Templeman LJ , at p 1132 , in the Court of Appeal seems to me to establish this point conclusively despite the very well argued submissions of Mr Browne QC to the contrary . 	lord slynn	lord woolf	partagr	0	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	16	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	17	As to whether in this case the order was justified , I have no doubt that there was a sufficient and proportionate justification . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	18	The fact that Mr Brady may have initiated or consented to some publication of his medical records can not possibly deprive the hospital of the protection which they patently need . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	lord hobhouse, lord woolf

36	28	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	29	This appeal is concerned with the right of a newspaper to refuse to reveal its sources . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	30	It arises out of the publication on 2 December 1999 of an article in the `` Daily Mirror '' which was written by their investigations editor , Mr Gary Jones . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	31	The article included verbatim extracts of the medical records of Ian Brady -LRB- one of the Moors murderers -RRB- , a patient at Ashworth Security Hospital -LRB- `` Ashworth '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	32	He was , at the time of the publication , engaged on a well publicised hunger strike . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	33	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	34	Ashworth Hospital Authority is responsible for the management of Ashworth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	35	The authority is the claimant in the proceedings and respondent before your Lordships . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	36	The authority is one of the three special health authorities established by the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to sections 1 and 4 of the National Health Services Act 1977 , as amended , for persons subject to detention under the Mental Health Act 1983 as requiring treatment under conditions of special security on account of their dangerous , violent or criminal propensities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	37	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	38	On 19 April 2000 , Rougier J ordered the defendant , MGN Ltd , the publisher of the `` Daily Mirror '' , by its proper officer within two working days to make and serve upon the authority a witness statement : -LRB- i -RRB- explaining how it came to be in the possession or control of any medical records kept by the claimant in respect of Ian Brady whether that possession or control be of originals , copies or extracts ; -LRB- ii -RRB- identifying any employee of the claimant and the name of the person or persons -LRB- and any address , telephone and fax numbers known for such a person or persons -RRB- who were involved in the defendant acquiring possession or control of the said records . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	39	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	40	MGN appealed against that order and on 18 December 2000 the Court of Appeal dismissed that appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	41	In the course of the further appeal to their Lordships , MGN contend that Rougier J had no jurisdiction to grant the order , but that if he did have jurisdiction to grant the order , he was not entitled to do so in the circumstances of this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	42	Background facts 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	43	On 30 September 1999 , Ian Brady was transferred to another ward . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	44	He took objection both to the transfer and to the manner in which it was effected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	45	In addition to making complaints to the police and through the National Health Service complaints procedure he went on hunger strike . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	46	At the same time he began a media campaign , writing repeatedly to the BBC and others and issuing information through his solicitor complaining about the way that he had been treated , giving details of his hunger strike and the manner in which he was affected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	47	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	48	Because of the substantial media interest which Ian Brady generated , the director of communications of Ashworth found it necessary to make 12 press releases between 30 September 1999 and 11 January 2000 answering inquiries for information . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	49	The release of the 2 October 1999 began by stating : `` Ian Brady , a patient at Ashworth Hospital , has exercised his right to refuse permission for the hospital to disclose any clinical details about him '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	50	On 29 October , it was announced that he had refused food for a total of 30 days and that a program of `` refeeding '' had been introduced , which involved force feeding by means of a nasogastric tube . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	51	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	52	On 2 February 2000 , Ian Brady obtained permission to apply for judicial review , in order to challenge the continuing decision to force feed him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	53	The hearing was held in private but , due to the public interest in the case , Maurice Kay J delivered his judgment in open court : see R -LRB- Brady -RRB- v Ashworth Hospital Authority -LSB- 2000 -RSB- Lloyd 's Med R 355 ; -LRB- 2001 -RRB- 58 BMLR 173 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	54	Maurice Kay J ruled that force feeding was lawful since it was reasonably administered as part of the medical treatment given for the mental disorder from which Ian Brady was suffering . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	55	By virtue of section 63 of the 1983 Act consent was not needed for such treatment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	56	The judgment set out in detail particulars of Ian Brady 's clinical history which related to his decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	57	The source of the information sent to the Daily Mirror 13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	58	It was Mr Jones 's evidence that he did not know the identity of the initial source of the information , but that he assumed it to be an employee of Ashworth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	59	However , he accepted that he did know the identity of the intermediary who supplied the material to him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	60	It is also accepted that knowledge of the intermediary would in all probability lead to the identity of the original source . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	61	Mr Jones had previously dealt with the intermediary on the understanding that he would be paid for stories supplied . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	62	On this occasion he paid # 1,500 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	63	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	64	It was found by the Court of Appeal and was not disputed on this appeal that it was the overwhelming likelihood that the source provided the intermediary with a print out from Ashworth 's computer database which is used to record data about patients -LRB- `` PACIS '' -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	65	This meant the source was probably an employee of the authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	66	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	67	Rougier J found that the extracts of the information published in the article were no more than a watered down version of material which Ian Brady had placed already in the public domain in furtherance of his campaign . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	68	The importance of confidentiality in relation to patients medical records 16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	69	The importance of confidentiality of medical records is emphasised when a new member of staff is engaged at Ashworth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	70	The contract of employment contains a clause : `` Disclosure of information . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	71	You must not whilst you are employed or after your employment ends disclose to any unauthorised person information concerning the authority 's business or the patients in its care nor must you make any copy , abstract , summary or précis of the whole or part of a document relating to the authority . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	72	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	73	It is part of the agreed facts that leaks to the press have a detrimental effect on security ; treatment of patients and staff morale , because they may inhibit proper recording of information about patients ; may deter patients from providing information about themselves ; may damage the patient-doctor relationship , which rests on trust ; may lead to assaults by patients on a patient about whom information is disclosed ; may create an atmosphere of distrust amongst staff , which is detrimental to efficient and co-operative work ; and give rise to fear of future -LRB- and potentially more damaging -RRB- leaks . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	74	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	75	In the case of patients at Ashworth , it is particularly important that accurate records are kept because otherwise warning signs indicating that a patient is in a condition in which he could be a danger to himself , his fellow patients or the staff could be overlooked so inhibiting preventative action being taken . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	76	19 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	77	It is not in dispute that Ashworth has itself carried out an appropriate investigation in an attempt to discover the source of the leak without success , and that the only way in which the source is likely to be discovered is as a result of an order such as that made by Rougier J . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	78	It is also not in dispute that the reason for seeking an order for disclosure is to discipline the person responsible for the leak which in practice would mean that that person would be dismissed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	79	20 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	80	After the publication in the `` Daily Mirror '' , Ashworth tightened security and since then there has been no further breach of security . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	81	This increased security has involved reducing access to PACIS which has a detrimental effect on the running of Ashworth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	82	Furthermore , the judge concluded that if confidence in the security of a database is undermined , the use of the database for recording sensitive information would be inhibited and this would have the effect of dissuading patients from providing information about themselves . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	83	As the judge stated : `` Once it were known among patients that their records might well be leaked there would , in all probability , be a sharp downturn in the essential therapeutic patient-doctor relationship where trust is of fundamental importance . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	84	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	85	The judge also concluded that `` it is not so much the nature of this leak , but the fact that it happened at all , which is all-important , for , unless stopped , that which has occurred once may well occur again '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	86	The issues which MGN Limited raises on this appeal 22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	87	By a letter of 11 March 2002 , Kerman and Co. , the solicitors to MGN , wrote to the Judicial Office of the House `` to make it absolutely clear what issues are and are not in dispute on this appeal '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	88	The letter initially identified the points which MGN are not taking as follows : -LRB- i -RRB- They do not dispute that the authority has an independent right in the confidentiality of the records , assuming that the contents of the records were truly confidential . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	89	-LRB- ii -RRB- Nor do they contend that the jurisdiction , which they describe as the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction , should be confined to cases of tort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	90	-LRB- iii -RRB- On the assumption that the sending by the intermediary of Ian Brady 's running records to Mr Jones was a tortious act , MGN no longer contend that MGN was not innocently mixed up in that act `` so as to trigger the operation of the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction against them '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	91	23 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	92	The letter then goes on to identify the contentions which MGN were advancing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	93	These are : -LRB- iv -RRB- The authority had failed to establish that the unpublished material in Ian Brady 's running records was truly confidential in the sense that it was secret or not in the public domain -LRB- the confidentiality issue -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	94	-LRB- v -RRB- As all the published information had been placed in the public domain by Ian Brady himself , MGN was not a tortfeasor in publishing the extracts from the running records -LRB- the tortfeasor issue -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	95	-LRB- vi -RRB- The `` interests of justice '' exception to section 10 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 is limited to cases where disclosure is required for existing or intended proceedings -LRB- the section 10 issue -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	96	-LRB- vii -RRB- Whether , applying the article 10 jurisprudence to the proper construction of section 10 and to the facts of this case , the authority have established convincingly that an order for discovery was proportionate to a legitimate aim within article 10 -LRB- 2 -RRB- and strictly necessary in a democratic society -LRB- the article 10 issue -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	97	-LRB- viii -RRB- The Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction to order discovery is an aid to litigation and does not extend to cases where a claimant has neither brought nor intends to bring proceedings -LRB- the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction issue -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	98	24 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	99	The letter reflects conveniently the shape of the principle arguments advanced by Mr Desmond Browne QC on behalf of MGN on this appeal and I therefore propose to deal with the issues which the letter identifies as well as the issue as to the manner in which Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction was exercised in this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	100	Issues numbered one and two can be taken together and I turn to them now . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	101	The confidentiality and tortfeasor issues 25 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	102	If this was not already clear from the letter of 11 March 2002 , MGN made it clear both in their written and oral arguments in support of the appeal that it is a part of MGN case that if the information relating to Ian Brady which they published was not confidential , in the sense that it was neither secret nor in the public domain , and this meant that MGN was not a tortfeasor , then disclosure could not be ordered . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	103	26 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	104	This approach on the part of MGN Limited reveals a fundamental misconception as to the basis for ordering disclosure under the now well established Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	105	Under this jurisdiction , there is no requirement that the person against whom the proceedings have been brought should be an actual wrongdoer who has committed a tort or breached a contract or committed some other civil or criminal wrongful act . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	106	In Norwich Pharmacal Co v Customs and Excise Comrs -LSB- 1974 -RSB- AC 133 itself , the Customs and Excise Commissioners were an entirely innocent party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	107	The commissioners had , however , because of their statutory responsibilities become involved or mixed up in the illicit importation of the chemicals manufactured abroad which Norwich Pharmacal alleged infringed their patent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	108	The Norwich Pharmacal case clearly establishes that where a person , albeit innocently , and without incurring any personal liability , becomes involved in a wrongful act of another , that person thereby comes under a duty to assist the person injured by those acts by giving him any information which he is able to give by way of discovery that discloses the identity of the wrongdoer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	109	While therefore the exercise of the jurisdiction does require that there should be wrongdoing , the wrongdoing which is required is the wrongdoing of the person whose identity the claimant is seeking to establish and not that of the person against whom the proceedings are brought . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	110	27 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	111	The correct position is made clear from the speech of Lord Reid in the Norwich Pharmacal case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	112	The first passage of the speech of Lord Reid to which I would refer states , at p 174 : `` So discovery to find the identity of a wrongdoer is available against anyone against whom the plaintiff has a cause of action in relation to the same wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	113	It is not available against a person who has no other connection with the wrong than that he was a spectator or has some document relating to it in his possession . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	114	But the respondents are in an intermediate position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	115	Their conduct was entirely innocent ; it was in execution of their statutory duty . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	116	But without certain action on their part the infringements could never have been committed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	117	Does this involvement in the matter make a difference ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	118	28 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	119	Lord Reid answers this question in the affirmative without dealing in detail with the earlier authorities other than by making a general reference to the speeches of Lord Cross of Chelsea and Lord Kilbrandon which do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	120	However , Lord Reid goes on to state in further passages of his speech , at p 175 , to which I will now refer that : `` They -LSB- the authorities -RSB- seem to me to point to a very reasonable principle that if through no fault of his own a person gets mixed up in the tortious acts of others so as to facilitate their wrongdoing he may incur no personal liability but he comes under a duty to assist the person who has been wronged by giving him full information and disclosing the identity of the wrongdoers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	121	I do not think that it matters whether he became so mixed up by voluntary action on his part or because it was his duty to do what he did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	122	It may be that if this causes him expense the person seeking the information ought to reimburse him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	123	But justice requires that he should co-operate in righting the wrong if he unwittingly facilitated its perpetration . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	124	`` I am the more inclined to reach this result because it is clear that if the person mixed up in the affair has to any extent incurred any liability to the person wronged , he must make full disclosure even though the person wronged has no intention of proceeding against him . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	125	It would I think be quite illogical to make his obligation to disclose the identity of the real offenders depend on whether or not he has himself incurred some minor liability . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	126	I would therefore hold that the respondents must disclose the information now sought unless there is some consideration of public policy which prevents that . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	127	29 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	128	Lord Kilbrandon , having referred to the authorities and , like Lord Reid , been impressed by the views expressed by Lord Romiley MR in Upmann v Elkan -LRB- 1871 -RRB- LR 12 Eq 140 ; 7 Ch App 130 , summarises the position by saying , at pp 205-206 : `` There is no suggestion that in so doing he is pretending to exercise any right of relief against the discoverers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	129	`` In my opinion , accordingly , the respondents , in consequence of the relationship in which they stand , arising out of their statutory functions , to the goods imported , can properly be ordered by the court to disclose to the appellants the names of persons whom the appellants bona fide believe to be infringing these rights , this being their only practicable source of information as to whom they should sue , subject to any special right of exception which the respondents may qualify in respect of their position as a department of state . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	130	It has to be conceded that there is no direct precedent for the granting of such an application in the precise circumstances of this case , but such an exercise of the power of the court seems to be well within broad principles authoritatively laid down .

36	131	That exercise will always be subject to judicial discretion , and it may well be that the reason for the limitation in practice on what may be a wider power to order discovery , to any case in which the defendant has been ` mixed up with the transaction ' , to use Lord Romilly 's words , or ` stands in some relation ' to the goods , within the meaning of the decision in Post v Toledo , Cincinnati and St Louis Railroad Co -LRB- 1887 -RRB- 11 NERep 540 , is that that is the way in which judicial discretion ought to be exercised .

36	133	Similar statements can be found in the Norwich Pharmacal case in the other speeches of their Lordships . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	134	They make it clear that what is required is involvement or participation in the wrongdoing and that if there is the necessary involvement , it does not matter that the person from whom discovery is sought was innocent and in ignorance of the wrongdoing by the person whose identity it is hoped to establish . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf

36	136	Although initially I detected in Mr Browne 's argument a suggestion that because of the activities of Ian Brady in publicising his medical condition , there was no initial wrongdoing by the source who supplied the intermediary so that that intermediary could supply Mr Jones with the material for his article , this suggestion can not be sustained . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	137	The probabilities are that the source was a member of staff who had access to Ian Brady 's file within PACIS . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	138	-LRB- According to the agreed statement of facts and issues those who had access to the file `` included the staff on his ward , his patient care team , site managers , medical care staff , health records staff , the pharmacy , all doctors in the directorate and their medical secretaries , all psychologists and social workers and security staff '' . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	139	As was pointed out by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in the course of argument , any members of staff would have been acting in breach of their contracts of employment if they were responsible for transmitting the contents of a file to the intermediary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	140	They would undoubtedly be wrongdoers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	141	32 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	142	I also accept the conclusion of Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR in the Court of Appeal -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 1 WLR 515 , paras 50-54 that , while Ian Brady 's conduct in putting similar information into the public domain could well mean that he would not be in a position to complain about the publication , this did not destroy the authority 's independent interest in retaining the confidentiality of the medical records contained in Ashworth 's files . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	143	So the source who abstracted the information from the database not only acted in breach of confidence ; he or she also acted in breach of contract . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	144	33 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	145	The Master of the Rolls went on to conclude , in paragraph 63 : `` The intermediary , knowing that the information had been obtained in breach of confidence , passed it to MGN , through Mr Jones . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	146	MGN , knowing that the information had been transferred in breach of confidence , published extracts from it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	147	In these circumstances , claims for breach of confidence lie against MGN , the intermediary and the source . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	148	34 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	149	On the facts of the present case the Master of the Rolls is almost certainly correct in coming to this conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	150	However , for the purposes of the present appeal , as I have already explained , such a finding in favour of the authority is not necessary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	151	It is sufficient that the source was a wrongdoer and MGN became involved in the wrongdoing which is incontestably the position . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	152	Whether the source 's wrongdoing was tortious , or in breach of contract in my judgment matters not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	153	If there was wrongdoing then there is no further requirement that Mr Jones ' and MGN conduct should also be wrongful . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	154	It is sufficient if , in the words of Lord Dilhorne in the Norwich Pharmacal case , at p 188C , that there was `` involvement or participation '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	155	As MGN published the information which was wrongfully obtained , the answer as to whether there was involvement or participation must be an emphatic yes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	156	35 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	157	Although this requirement of involvement or participation on the part of the party from whom discovery is sought is not a stringent requirement , it is still a significant requirement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	158	It distinguishes that party from a mere onlooker or witness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	159	The need for involvement , the reference to participation can be dispensed with because it adds nothing to the requirement of involvement , is a significant requirement because it ensures that the mere onlooker can not be subjected to the requirement to give disclosure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	160	Such a requirement is an intrusion upon a third party to the wrongdoing and the need for involvement provides justification for this intrusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	161	36 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	162	It is not the only protection available to the third party . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	163	There is the more general protection which derives from the fact that this is a discretionary jurisdiction which enables the court to be astute to avoid a third party who has become involved innocently in wrongdoing by another from being subjected to a requirement to give disclosure unless this is established to be a necessary and proportionate response in all the circumstances : see John v Express Newspapers -LSB- 2000 -RSB- 1 WLR 1931 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	164	The need for involvement can therefore be described as a threshold requirement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	165	The fact that there is involvement enables a court to consider whether it is appropriate to make the order which is sought . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	166	In exercising its discretion the court will take into account the fact that innocent third parties can be indemnified for their costs while at the same time recognising that this does not mean there is no inconvenience to third parties as a result of becoming embroiled in proceedings through no fault on their part .

36	169	Section 10 of the 1981 Act provides : `` No court may require a person to disclose , nor is any person guilty of contempt of court for refusing to disclose , the source of information contained in a publication for which he is responsible , unless it be established to the satisfaction of the court that disclosure is necessary in the interests of justice or national security or for the prevention of disorder or crime .

36	170	Article 10 of the Convention provides : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- Everyone has the right to freedom of expression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf

'' -LRB- 2 -RRB- The exercise of these freedoms , since it carries with it duties and responsibilities , may be subject to such formalities , conditions , restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society , in the interests of national security , territorial integrity or public safety , for the prevention of disorder or crime , for the protection of health or morals , for the protection of the reputation or rights of others , for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence , or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary .

36	172	38 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	173	Judicial opinion differs as to the extent that section 10 was passed in order that our domestic law might reflect article 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	174	That this is the case can be seen by comparing the views of Schiemann LJ in Camelot Group plc v Centaur Communications Limited -LSB- 1999 -RSB- QB 124 , 128 with Sedley LJ 's in Financial Times Ltd v Interbrew SA -LSB- 2002 -RSB- EWCA Civ 274 -LRB- paragraphs 9 and 10 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	175	However , whatever was the objective of those promoting section 10 , there can be no doubt now that both section 10 and article 10 have a common purpose in seeking to enhance the freedom of the press by protecting journalistic sources . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	176	The approach of the European Court of Human Rights as to the role of article 10 in achieving this was clearly set out by the court in Goodwin v United Kingdom -LRB- 1966 -RRB- 22 EHRR 123 in these terms : `` 39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	177	The court recalls that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and that the safeguards to be afforded to the press are of particular importance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	178	Protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press freedom , as is reflected in the laws and the professional codes of conduct in a number of contracting states and is affirmed in several international instruments on journalistic freedoms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	179	Without such protection , sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public on matters of public interest . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	180	As a result the vital public watchdog role of the press may be undermined and the ability of the press to provide accurate and reliable information may be adversely affected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	181	Having regard to the importance of the protection of journalistic sources for press freedom in a democratic society and the potentially chilling effect an order of source disclosure has on the exercise of that freedom , such a measure can not be compatible with article 10 of the Convention unless it is justified by an overriding requirement in the public interest . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	182	The same approach can be applied equally to section 10 now that article 10 is part of our domestic law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	183	39 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	184	The decision in the Goodwin case followed on from the decision of their Lordships in X Ltd v Morgan-Grampian -LRB- Publishers -RRB- Ltd -LSB- 1991 -RSB- 1 AC 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	185	Lord Bridge of Harwich , with whom Lord Oliver of Aylmerton and Lord Lowry agreed , indicated how the approach to be adopted to section 10 involved very much the same balancing exercise as is involved in applying article 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	186	Lord Bridge expressed the position in these terms , at pp 43-44 : `` But the question whether disclosure is necessary in the interests of justice gives rise to a more difficult problem of weighing one public interest against another . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	187	A question arising under this part of section 10 has not previously come before your Lordships ' House for decision . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	188	In discussing the section generally Lord Diplock said in Secretary of State for Defence v Guardian Newspapers Ltd -LSB- 1985 -RSB- AC 339 , 350 : ` The exceptions include no reference to `` the public interest '' generally and I would add that in my view the expression `` justice '' , the interests of which are entitled to protection , is not used in a general sense as the antonym of `` injustice '' but in the technical sense of the administration of justice in the course of legal proceedings in a court of law , or , by reason of the extended definition of `` court '' in section 19 of the Act of 1981 , before a tribunal or body exercising the judicial power of the state . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	189	`` I agree entirely with the first half of this dictum . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	190	To construe ` justice ' as the antonym of ` injustice ' in section 10 would be far too wide . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	191	But to confine it to ` the technical sense of the administration of justice in the course of legal proceedings in a court of law ' seems to me , with all respect due to any dictum of the late Lord Diplock , to be too narrow . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	192	It is , in my opinion , ` in the interests of justice ' , in the sense in which this phrase is used in section 10 , that persons should be enabled to exercise important legal rights and to protect themselves from serious legal wrongs whether or not resort to legal proceedings in a court of law will be necessary to attain these objectives . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	193	Thus , to take a very obvious example , if an employer of a large staff is suffering grave damage from the activities of an unidentified disloyal servant , it is undoubtedly in the interests of justice that he should be able to identify him in order to terminate his contract of employment , notwithstanding that no legal proceedings may be necessary to achieve that end . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.4	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	194	`` Construing the phrase ` in the interests of justice ' in this sense immediately emphasises the importance of the balancing exercise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	195	It will not be sufficient , per se , for a party seeking disclosure of a source protected by section 10 to show merely that he will be unable without disclosure to exercise the legal right or avert the threatened legal wrong on which he bases his claim in order to establish the necessity of disclosure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	196	The judge 's task will always be to weigh in the scales the importance of enabling the ends of justice to be attained in the circumstances of the particular case on the one hand against the importance of protecting the source on the other hand . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	197	In this balancing exercise it is only if the judge is satisfied that disclosure in the interests of justice is of such preponderating importance as to override the statutory privilege against disclosure that the threshold of necessity will be reached . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	198	40 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	199	It will be seen immediately from this passage of the speech of Lord Bridge that Lord Bridge was adopting a broader approach to what is `` in the interests of justice '' for the purposes of section 10 than the approach suggested by Lord Diplock in the earlier case of Secretary of State for Defence v Guardian Newspapers Limited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	200	Lord Oliver in the Morgan-Grampian case , at pp 53G-54C , also questioned Lord Diplock 's construction which he regarded as imposing a limitation not easily defensible in logic . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	201	The Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction issue 41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	202	Both Lord Diplock and Lord Bridge were considering what amounts to `` the interests of justice '' in the context of section 10 as does the third issue identified in the letter of 11 March 2002 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	203	However , it is important to note that section 10 does not give the court any authority which it did not otherwise have to make orders for disclosure of sources of information . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	204	The way this section works is that it assumes the jurisdiction exists and places restrictions upon its exercise . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	205	The views of Lord Diplock and Lord Bridge therefore do not directly deal with the prior question as to whether the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction to order disclosure of sources extends beyond situations where the information to be disclosed is required for purposes other than existing or intended proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	206	42 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	207	As to this question , basing himself upon the historic sources of the jurisdiction which is founded upon the historic equitable bill of discovery , Mr Browne for MGN contends that as the reason that the authority requires the information is not to bring the proceedings against any individual but to dismiss the original source of the information , the objective of the authority does not fall within this exceptional jurisdiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	208	43 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	209	Mr Nigel Pleming QC on behalf of the authority contests Mr Browne 's approach . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	210	He submits that the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction is not as narrow as was submitted by Mr Browne . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	211	Alternatively , if he is wrong as to this he submits that , if this is necessary , in order to obtain an order , the authority is prepared to sue the source after the source is identified even though this will involve proceedings which are otherwise wholly unnecessary since the authority would be quite content if they were in a position to dismiss the source . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	212	44 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	213	It is clear that in the Norwich Pharmacal case itself , Lord Reid was contemplating situations where the intention of the claimant , once the source had been identified , was to bring proceedings against the source . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	214	The language used by Lord Reid can be explained by the fact that in that case , it was the intention of Norwich Pharmacal to bring proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	215	It is also to be noted that in the final paragraph already cited from his speech , Lord Reid was taking a common sense non-technical approach when justifying the jurisdiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	216	Furthermore , the other speeches do not link the jurisdiction to any requirement that the information should be available to the individual who had been wronged only for the purpose of enabling him to vindicate that wrong by bringing proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	217	In particular , Viscount Dilhorne in his speech says , at p 188 : `` discovery can be granted against a person who is not a mere witness to discover , the fact of some wrongdoing being established , who was responsible for it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	218	The ` mere witness ' rule has lost a great deal of its importance since the Common Law Procedure Act removed the bar to persons interested giving evidence , but it still has significance . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	219	Someone involved in the transaction is not a mere witness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	220	If he could be sued , even though there be no intention of suing him , he is not a mere witness . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	221	In Orr v Diaper -LRB- 1876 -RRB- 4 Ch D 92 -LSB- Diaper -RSB- were involved , so were Elkans in Upmann v Elkan LR 12 Eq 140 , so was the East India Company in Moodalay v Morton -LRB- 1785 -RRB- 1 BroCC 469 and it matters not that the involvement or participation was innocent and in ignorance of the wrongdoing .

36	226	In the later case of British Steel Corp v Granada Television Ltd -LSB- 1981 -RSB- AC 1096 , however , the point arose directly . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	227	In the Court of Appeal Lord Denning MR , at p 1127 , in my view correctly regarded the Norwich Pharmacal case as opening `` a new chapter in our law '' and then went on to add : `` Mr Irvine suggested this was limited to cases where the injured person desired to sue the wrongdoer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	228	I see no reason why it should be so limited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf

36	230	46 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	231	Templeman LJ 's remarks , at p 1132 , are even more apposite ; he stated : `` In my judgment the principle of the Norwich Pharmacal case applies whether or not the victim intends to pursue action in the courts against the wrongdoer provided that the existence of a cause of action is established and the victim can not otherwise obtain justice . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	232	The remedy of discovery is intended in the final analysis to enable justice to be done . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	233	Justice can be achieved against an erring employee in a variety of ways and a plaintiff may obtain an order for discovery provided he shows that he is genuinely seeking lawful redress of a wrong and can not otherwise obtain redress . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	234	In the present case BSC state that they will not finally determine whether to take legal proceedings or whether to dismiss the employee or whether to obtain redress in some other lawful manner until they have considered the identity , status and excuses of the employee . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	235	The disclosure of the identity of the disloyal employee will by itself protect BSC and their innocent employees now and for the future and is essential if B.S.C. are to redress the wrong . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	236	47 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.5	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	237	In their Lordships ' House , Lord Wilberforce and in particular Lord Fraser of Tullybelton , at p 1200 , were clearly of the view that the order could be made even if information was not required for the purposes of bringing an action against the informant .

36	239	Mr Browne 's arguments , based on the Parliamentary history of the section , I find totally unconvincing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	240	I have no doubt that the object of section 10 was to provide protection inter alia for the media . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	241	I also accept that the approach to the application of section 10 should be that which was reflected in the judgment on article 10 of the European Court in Sunday Times v United Kingdom -LRB- 1979 -RRB- 2 EHRR 245 , 281 , para 65 : `` The court is faced not with a choice between two conflicting principles , but with a principle of freedom of expression that is subject to a number of exceptions which must be narrowly interpreted . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	242	In the second place , the court 's supervision under article 10 covers not only the basic legislation but also the decision applying it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	243	It is not sufficient that the interference involved belongs to that class of the exceptions listed in article 10 -LRB- 2 -RRB- which has been invoked ; neither is it sufficient that the interference was imposed because its subject-matter fell within a particular category or was caught by a legal rule formulated in general or absolute terms : the court has to be satisfied that the interference was necessary having regard to the facts and circumstances prevailing in the specific case before it .

36	246	There are real disadvantages in not following those views . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	247	To do so will result in proceedings having to be brought for purely technical reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	248	Mr Browne suggested that to agree to bring proceedings for this purpose would be an abuse of process , but why would it be an abuse ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	249	Such a claimant would be doing no more than bringing proceedings which he is entitled to bring . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	250	The situation would be no different from joining an additional party as a claimant or defendant for procedural purposes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	251	The important protection which both section 10 and article 10 provide for freedom of expression is that they require the court stringently to scrutinise any request for relief which will result in the court interfering with freedom of expression including ordering the disclosure of journalists ' sources . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf

36	256	Having done so , he came to the conclusion that the detection of crime is not a proper object of the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction for both historical and contemporary reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	257	He recognised that he was taking a different view from the Master of the Rolls in this case , but he considered the issues were different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	258	This is to adopt an unduly restrictive approach to this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	259	Sedley LJ went on to state , in paragraph 20 : `` Even in the period before the mid-19th century , when the majority of prosecutions were privately brought , the identification of criminals does not feature in the reported cases as a proper purpose of the bill of discovery . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	260	Today , when prosecution , subject to rare exceptions , is the task of the state , I can see no justification for introducing it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	261	The prosecution of offences , notably in the field of financial services , is the business of specialised agencies equipped with statutory powers of search and seizure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	262	Each of these powers , none of them unlimited , represents a carefully struck balance between the needs of the community and the rights of the individual . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	263	To undercut them with a civil right to compel production of documents or data at the instance of a person claiming to be the victim of a crime would be to court catastrophe . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	264	For what purpose would the documents be exigible ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	265	If prosecution , that will rarely be the applicant 's intent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	266	Here , for instance , Interbrew say that they are entirely content to leave the question of criminal proceedings to the -LSB- Financial Services Authority -RSB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	267	If the purpose is civil process , what is the relevance of the commission of a crime ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	268	If it has to be crime of which the applicant is a victim , there is almost bound to be a civil cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	269	If it were able to be a crime of which the applicant is not a victim , the limited Norwich Pharmacal purpose would be replaced by a practically untrammelled right to disclosure . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	270	51 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	271	In paragraph 28 , Sedley LJ makes additional remarks upon which Mr Browne in particular relies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	272	They are in these terms : `` To this relatively modest extent , therefore , I agree with Lightman J that a breach of confidence is made out . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	273	What is not in my view made out is the bigger and better cause of action in respect of the ` lethal cocktail ' of fact and falsehood , since the element of falsehood can neither form part of the protected confidence nor stand on its own as a discrete tort . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	274	Nor , it seems to me , is it material to the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction that Interbrew will be able to dismiss the source , if they find him or her within their organisation , for misconduct in falsifying as well as leaking documents . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	275	That is well within the ambit of the interests of justice on the broad interpretation of section 10 of the 1981 Act if and when one reaches it ; but for the same reasons as are set out above in relation to the detection of crime , it can have no place in the jurisdiction to require disclosure in support of a cause of action . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	276	52 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	277	If Sedley LJ is correct in his views as to the restrictions on use of the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction to discover those who are responsible for crimes and for the purposes of dismissing a source who is an employee , then clearly this raises difficulties for the authority unless it adopts its alternative course of undertaking to bring proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	278	53 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	279	However , I do not agree with the views of Sedley LJ set out in the passages of his judgment I have cited . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	280	His views on the legitimacy of requiring the identification of the wrongdoer so that he can be dismissed are inconsistent with the statement of the position expressed in the British Steel case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	281	In relation to crime , I would not accept the distinction Sedley LJ makes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	282	As Sedley LJ recognises , it is likely that in the great majority of circumstances , if the wrongdoing constitutes a crime , it will also constitute a civil wrong so the different treatment is unjustified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	283	In addition the jurisdiction , as it has developed , enables an individual who has caused harm by wrongdoing , wrongdoing with which the defendant has become involved , to be identified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	284	If the law has developed so as to enable , in the appropriate circumstances , the wrongdoer to be identified if he has committed a civil wrong I can find no justification for not requiring the wrongdoer to be identified if he has committed a criminal wrong . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	285	To draw a distinction between civil and criminal wrongs can only be justified if , contrary to the views I have already expressed , disclosure can only be ordered to enable civil proceedings to be brought against the wrongdoer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	286	If the victim of the wrongdoing is content that the wrongdoer should be prosecuted by the appropriate prosecuting authority I can not see any objection to his obtaining the identity of the wrongdoer to enable that to happen . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	287	The prosecution may achieve for the victim the remedy which the victim requires just as dismissal of an employee can do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	288	The more restrictive approach attaches excessive significance to the historic origins of the jurisdiction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	289	If this approach had been adopted to the jurisdiction to grant injunctions , freezing orders -LRB- Mareva injunctions -RRB- would never have been developed from the late 1970s onwards . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	290	54 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	291	As I understand Sedley LJ 's reasoning , he is concerned that a claim to exercise the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction might be made by someone who is not a victim of the wrongdoing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	292	The answer to this concern is not to limit artificially the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction but to confine the remedy to the victim of the crime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	293	It is true that crimes are usually offences against the public as a whole but the courts and the law are now progressively showing greater concern for the protection of individual victims of crimes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	294	Certainly , I would agree that an individual who has not suffered in consequence of a crime would not be entitled to bring proceedings . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	295	Such proceedings would have to be brought on behalf of the public by the Attorney General . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	296	What would be the outcome of such an application I do not have to anticipate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	297	However , allowing the victim of a crime to obtain the identity of the wrongdoer should not involve the dramatic consequences that Sedley LJ fears . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	298	55 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	299	In the case of a proposed private prosecution surprisingly , having regard to the views he had already expressed , Sedley LJ accepted the position could be different . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	300	He said , in paragraph 22 : `` Private prosecutions are still permissible and from time to time prove their value as a longstop behind an inert public authority . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	301	I would want to leave open the situation where an applicant can show a genuine need or wish to bring a private prosecution but requires the respondent 's help in identifying the wrongdoer . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	302	It is not this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	303	In a case such as this , which is the ordinary case , I would hold that it is immaterial to the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction that the wrongdoer may have been guilty of a crime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	304	What matters is that the applicant means to bring a civil action , or otherwise to assert its legal rights -LRB- see the British Steel case , per Lord Wilberforce , at p 1174 -RRB- , as soon as it knows who the correct defendant is . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	305	56 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	306	Sedley LJ refers to Lord Wilberforce 's speech , at p 1174 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	307	There Lord Wilberforce stated : `` Now I would be prepared if necessary to hold that , given a cause of action , an intention to seek redress - by court action or otherwise - would be enough ... '' Clearly Lord Wilberforce anticipated that there would be a cause of action as there will be in the case of most crimes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	308	However , I would not myself regard Lord Wilberforce 's remark as meaning that in the appropriate circumstances wrongdoing which amounted to a crime would not suffice , albeit that it did not involve a cause of action . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	309	The very fact that Sedley LJ leaves open the situation where an applicant wishes to bring a private prosecution does indicate that the situation is not quite as black and white as his earlier remarks indicated . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	310	I do , however , find it just as objectionable to require a person who has been wronged to bring a private prosecution in order to obtain the identity of the source of the wrongdoing when the Crown Prosecution Service would prosecute as it is to require the victim to have to bring civil proceedings when this is unnecessary . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	311	57 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	312	The Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction is an exceptional one and one which is only exercised by the courts when they are satisfied that it is necessary that it should be exercised . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	313	New situations are inevitably going to arise where it will be appropriate for the jurisdiction to be exercised where it has not been exercised previously . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	314	The limits which applied to its use in its infancy should not be allowed to stultify its use now that it has become a valuable and mature remedy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	315	That new circumstances for its appropriate use will continue to arise is illustrated by the decision of Sir Richard Scott V-C in P v T Ltd -LSB- 1997 -RSB- 1 WLR 1309 -LRB- where relief was granted because it was necessary in the interests of justice albeit that the claimant was not able to identify without discovery what would be the appropriate cause of action -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	316	58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	317	What I have said in relation to the disclosure of the identity of the source with a view to possible criminal proceedings does not detract from the requirement that the person from whom disclosure is sought must have been involved , whether innocently or otherwise , in the wrongdoing which would in these circumstances be criminal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	318	It is this requirement that means the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction does not offend the general principle that at common law there is no legal duty to provide the police with information or otherwise to assist them with their inquiries : see Rice v Connolly -LSB- 1966 -RSB- 2 QB 414 , 419E , per Lord Parker CJ . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	319	59 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	320	One of the arguments Mr Browne placed before their Lordships for not adopting the non-technical approach , which I regard as being the correct was that if the disclosure was not linked with proceedings which would actually be brought , there would be no means of the court protecting a defendant against misuse of the material which was disclosed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	321	60 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	322	I agree that this is a matter for concern . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	323	However , this concern will be met if an order for disclosure is not made unless a claimant has identified clearly the wrongdoing on which he relies in general terms and identifies the purposes for which the disclosure will be used when it is made . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	324	The use of the material will then be restricted expressly or implicitly to the disclosed purposes unless and until the court permits it to be used for another purpose . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	325	Order for disclosure made in this case 61 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	326	It is contended that the order for disclosure was not proportionate or necessary on the facts of this case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	327	This argument is not based on technicalities and it raises considerations of considerable importance as to how section 10 and article 10 in practice protect journalist 's sources . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	328	Any disclosure of a journalists sources does have a chilling effect on the freedom of the press . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	329	The court when considering making an order for disclosure in exercise of the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction must have this well in mind . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	330	The position is analogous to the long recognised position of informers under the criminal law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	331	In D v NSPCC -LSB- 1978 -RSB- AC 171 their Lordships applied the approach of the courts to police informants to those who provided information to the NSPCC . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	332	Having referred , at p 218 , to Marks v Beyfus -LRB- 1890 -RRB- 25 QBD 494 Lord Diplock explained the rationale of the rule as being plain , if the identity of informers were too readily liable to be disclosed in a court of law the sources of information would dry up and the police would be hindered in their duty of preventing and detecting crime . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	333	Ordering journalists to disclose their sources can have similar consequences . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	334	The fact is that information which should be placed in the public domain is frequently made available to the press by individuals who would lack the courage to provide the information if they thought there was a risk of their identity being disclosed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	335	The fact that journalists ' sources can be reasonably confident that their identity will not be disclosed makes a significant contribution to the ability of the press to perform their role in society of making information available to the public . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	336	It is for this reason that it is well established now that the courts will normally protect journalists ' sources from identification . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	337	However , the protection is not unqualified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	338	Both section 10 and article 10 recognise this . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	339	This leads to the difficult issue at the heart of this appeal , namely whether the disclosure ordered was necessary and not disproportionate . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	340	The requirements of necessity and proportionality are here separate concepts which substantially cover the same area . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	341	In his submissions Mr Browne relied correctly on the decision of the European Court in Goodwin v United Kingdom 22 EHRR 123 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	342	I find no difficulty in accepting the approach that the European Court emphasised , in paragraph 40 of its judgment , that : -LRB- i -RRB- `` As a matter of general principle , the ` necessity ' for any restriction of freedom of expression must be convincingly established '' and -LRB- ii -RRB- `` limitations on the confidentiality of journalistic sources call for the most careful scrutiny by the court . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	343	62 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	344	Furthermore , I would also adopt Mr Browne 's contention that any restriction on the otherwise unqualified right to freedom of expression must meet two further requirements . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	345	First , the exercise of the jurisdiction because of article 10 -LRB- 2 -RRB- should meet a `` pressing social need '' and secondly the restriction should be proportionate to a legitimate aim which is being pursued . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	346	63 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	347	In applying these tests to the facts of this case to which I have already referred -LRB- in paragraphs 16 to 18 -RRB- it is also important to have in mind the evidence of Dr. James Collins who is the responsible medical officer for Ian Brady . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	348	He explains why it is essential for the care and safety of individual patients and the safety of other patients and staff that relevant information is entered in the patients notes and why those entries having been made , their integrity and confidentiality should be preserved . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	349	He refers to the fact that psychiatry , more than any other branch of medicine , depends on a trusting relationship between therapists and patients . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	350	In addition he draws attention to the fact that the basis of virtually all assessment , diagnosis , treatment and analysis of risk is dependent on information provided by others . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	351	He explains that if the staff feel that if there is a possibility of what they report entering the public domain their reporting will be inhibited as they will think that this will place staff or patients at risk . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	352	In addition , Mr Brewster -LRB- information manager -RRB- , in his statement , sets out the reasons why it is important that the authority should be able to identify the employee or employees who are responsible for the wrongful disclosure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	353	These include preventing further disclosure and removing the cloud of suspicion that at present hangs generally over the authority 's employees who have access to the records which were published . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	354	Medical records will always be confidential but this is particularly important in the case of the class of patients that the authority is responsible for caring for at Ashworth . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	355	This is confirmed by the approach of the European Court to medical records in relation to article 8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	356	I refer to the judgment of that court in Z v Finland -LRB- 1998 -RRB- 25 EHRR 371 , paragraphs 94 and 95 : `` 94 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	357	In determining whether the impugned measures were ` necessary in a democratic society ' , the court will consider whether , in the light of the case as a whole , the reasons adduced to justify them were relevant and sufficient and whether the measures were proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	358	`` 95 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	359	In this connection , the court will take into account that the protection of personal data , not least medical data , is of fundamental importance to a person 's enjoyment of his or her right to respect for private and family life as guaranteed by article 8 of the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	360	Respecting the confidentiality of health data is a vital principle in the legal systems of all the contracting parties to the Convention . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	361	It is crucial not only to respect the sense of privacy of a patient but also to preserve his or her confidence in the medical profession and in the health services in general . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	362	`` Without such protection , those in need of medical assistance may be deterred from revealing such information of a personal and intimate nature as may be necessary in order to receive appropriate treatment and , even , from seeking such assistance , thereby endangering their own health and , in the case of transmissible diseases , that of the community `` The domestic law must therefore afford appropriate safeguards to prevent any such communication or disclosure of personal health data as may be inconsistent with the guarantees in article 8 of the Convention . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	363	Those paragraphs of the judgment were of course addressing the question of whether medical data should be disclosed in a different context from the present and it was not necessary for the court to balance the conflicting interests which are at play as is essential here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	364	However , the court 's judgment provides a useful guide as to the significance of the wrongdoing which occurred here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	365	64 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	366	Mr Browne subjected the approach of the trial judge , Rougier J , and the judgment of the Master of the Rolls with which the other members of the Court of Appeal agreed , to criticism . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	367	In particular , he objected to the terms of the final paragraph of the Master of the Rolls judgment where he stated , -LSB- 2001 -RSB- 1 WLR 515 , 537 : `` 99 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	368	The disclosure of confidential medical records to the press is misconduct which is not merely of concern to the individual establishment in which it occurs . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	369	It is an attack on an area of confidentiality which should be safeguarded in any democratic society . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	370	The protection of patient information is of vital concern to the National Health Service and , I suspect , to health services throughout Europe . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	371	This is an exceptional case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	372	If the order made by Rougier J discourages press sources from disclosing similar information in the future , this will be no bad thing . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	373	65 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	374	Mr Browne submits that in that paragraph the Master of the Rolls is treating the chilling effect of an order on journalists as `` no bad thing '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	375	This he said stands the Strasbourg jurisprudence on its head because it claims to detect a social value in the deterrent effect of an order on other potential sources in the future . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	376	Mr Browne in making this submission has misunderstood the Master of the Rolls . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	377	Earlier in his judgment the Master of the Rolls had subjected the jurisprudence of the European Court to detailed analysis and clearly had in mind the importance of the protection of sources provided by both section 10 and article 10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	378	What the Master of the Rolls regarded as being `` no bad thing '' was not the disclosure of the identity of sources but the discouragement of the wrongful disclosure of the contents of medical records by sources . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	379	This was conduct which exceptionally justified ordering the disclosure of documents which would reveal the identity of the source . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	380	66 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	381	That Mr Browne has misunderstood the Master of the Rolls is apparent from the fact that notwithstanding Laws LJ repeated on two occasions that he agreed the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by the Master of the Rolls , he himself stated the situation with regard to the protection of sources of the press in terms to which no possible objection could be taken in paragraphs 101 and 102 of his judgment . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	382	The situation here is exceptional , as it was in Financial Times Ltd v Interbrew SA -LSB- 2002 -RSB- EWCA Civ 274 and as it has to be , if disclosure of sources is to be justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	383	The care of patients at Ashworth is fraught with difficulty and danger . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	384	The disclosure of the patients ' records increases that difficulty and danger and to deter the same or similar wrongdoing in the future it was essential that the source should be identified and punished . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	385	This was what made the orders to disclose necessary and proportionate and justified . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	386	The fact that Ian Brady had himself disclosed his medical history did not detract from the need to prevent staff from revealing medical records of patients . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf

36	404	I should also express my agreement with the judgment in the Court of Appeal of the Master of the Rolls , Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	405	70 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	406	I will add only an observation about two decisions of the European Court of Human Rights , Goodwin v United Kingdom -LRB- 17488/90 -RRB- -LRB- 1996 -RRB- 22 EHRR 123 and Bergens Tidende v Norway -LRB- 26132/95 -RRB- -LRB- 2000 -RRB- 31 EHRR 16 71 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	407	In Goodwin , the newspaper had been ordered to disclose the source from which it had obtained confidential material . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	408	The newspaper relied upon Article 10 ; the United Kingdom responded by invoking paragraph -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Article . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	409	The Court underlined the importance for press freedom of the protection of journalistic sources . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	410	`` Without such protection , sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public on matters of public interest . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	411	-LRB- paragraph 39 -RRB- However the Court went on to say that this was subject to the proportionate protection of legitimate concerns under paragraph -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Article . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	412	The justification proffered by the national authorities must be `` relevant and sufficient '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	413	-LRB- paragraph 40 , emphasis supplied . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	414	In that case , the justification given for making the disclosure order against the newspaper was accepted by the Court to have been relevant ; the Government failed because the Court did not accept that , on the facts of that case , the justification was sufficient or the order a proportionate response . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	415	Thus the Court said at paragraphs 44 - 46 : `` Unless aware of the identity of the source , -LSB- the company -RSB- would not be able to stop such further dissemination of the contents of the plan , notably by bringing proceedings against him or her for recovery of the missing document , for an injunction against further disclosure by him or her and for compensation for damage . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	416	It also had a legitimate reason as a commercial enterprise in unmasking a disloyal employee or collaborator who might have continuing access to its premises in order to terminate his or her association with the company . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	417	These are undoubtedly relevant reasons . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	418	... In sum , there was not , in the Court 's view , a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the legitimate aim pursued by the disclosure order and the means deployed to achieve that aim . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	419	... '' 72 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	420	The Bergens Tidende case concerned a complaint by the newspaper that its rights under Article 10 of the Convention had been infringed by a libel action which a cosmetic surgeon had successfully brought against it in respect of defamatory articles it had published saying he was incompetent . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	421	The European Court of Human Rights upheld the complaint but in doing so held that the rights of the press are balanced by responsibilities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	422	Under the heading ` General Principles ' , the Court referred to its well-established case law and the freedom of expression which constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society , subject to Article 10 -LRB- 2 -RRB- which leaves the national authorities with a certain margin of appreciation and continued : `` The Court further recalls the essential function the press fulfils in a democratic society . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	423	Although the press must not overstep certain bounds , particularly as regards the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information , its duty is nevertheless to impart - in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities - information and ideas on all matters of public interest . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	424	-LRB- paragraph 49 -RRB- In applying these principles , the Court came back to the same point -LRB- paragraphs 52 and 53 -RRB- : `` Where , as in the present case , measures taken by the national authorities are capable of discouraging the press from disseminating information on matters of legitimate public concern , careful scrutiny of the proportionality of the measures on the part of the Court is called for . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	425	However , the Court further observes that Article 10 of the Convention does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matters of serious public concern . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	426	Under the terms of paragraph -LRB- 2 -RRB- of the Article , the exercise of this freedom carries with it ` duties and responsibilities ' which also apply to the press . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	427	The freedom given to the press is thus not one which the press may exercise without having proper regard to the rights of others , including the right of preserving confidentiality . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	428	73 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	429	These judgments of the Court confirm the compatibility of the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction as formulated by my noble and learned friend and the Master of the Rolls , provided that it is only exercised to obtain disclosure of a journalist 's sources when it is proportionate to do so . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
36	430	I agree that on the facts of this case there was sufficient and proportionate justification . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	lord hobhouse, lord woolf
