6	8	This appeal concerns the words , `` a dwelling-house ... ... ... . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
6	9	let as a separate dwelling '' in section 1 of the Housing Act 1988 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
6	10	A single room , as part of a house , may be a dwelling-house ; and on this appeal there is no issue of shared accommodation or facilities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
6	11	The key issue is : whether the room which Mr Collins occupied , in the Viscount Hotel , Prince of Wales Terrace , Kensington , when proceedings were brought , could in law qualify as a `` dwelling '' only if cooking facilities were there available . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
6	12	Unless constrained to the contrary by authority , I would impose no such restrictive interpretation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
6	13	Such a restrictive interpretation would both be unwarranted by the statutory language and an inappropriate gloss on provisions designed to give some protection to tenants in modest rented accommodation under assured tenancies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
6	14	3 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
6	15	`` Dwelling '' is not a term of art , but a familiar word in the English language , which in my judgment in this context connotes a place where one lives , regarding and treating it as home . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
6	16	Such a place does not cease to be a `` dwelling '' merely because one takes all or some of one 's meals out ; or brings take-away food in to the exclusion of home cooking ; or at times prepares some food for consumption on heating devices falling short of a full cooking facility . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
6	17	4 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
6	18	Decisions on the infinite factual variety of cases are for judges of trial and their decisions on the facts of individual cases should neither be treated nor cited as propositions of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN
6	19	I would not myself , for example , regard a bed , any more than cooking facilities , as an essential pre-requisite of a `` dwelling '' : every case is for the judge of trial but I would have no difficulty with a conclusion that one could live in a room , which is regarded and treated as home , although taking one 's sleep , without the luxury of a bed , in an armchair , or in blankets on the floor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0	NAN

6	22	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	23	LORD BINGHAM OF CORNHILL 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	24	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	25	6 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	26	I gratefully adopt the factual narrative given by my noble and learned friend Lord Millett , and also his summary of the relevant legislation and authorities . 	lord bingham	lord millett	factagr	0.1	NAN
6	27	7 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	28	Section 1 of the Housing Act 1988 , which the House must construe , has a very long pedigree . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	29	For present purposes it poses two central questions . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	30	The first is whether the landlord has granted a tenancy of the premises in question or merely a licence to occupy them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	31	That was a live question in the present case but one which , if relevant when the second question had been answered , would have had to be remitted to the county court . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	32	The second question is whether , if a tenancy be assumed , the premises which were let are a dwelling-house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	33	8 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	34	Much of the case law on this section and its predecessors has been directed to the requirement that the premises be let as a `` separate '' dwelling : see , in particular , Neale v Del Soto -LSB- 1945 -RSB- KB 144 ; Cole v Harris -LSB- 1945 -RSB- KB 474 ; Kenyon v Walker -LSB- 1946 -RSB- 2 All ER 595 ; Winters v Dance -LSB- 1949 -RSB- LJR 165 ; Baker v Turner -LSB- 1950 -RSB- AC 401 ; Hayward v Marshall -LSB- 1952 -RSB- 2 QB 89 ; Goodrich v Paisner -LSB- 1957 -RSB- AC 65 ; Marsh Ltd v Cooper -LSB- 1969 -RSB- 1 WLR 803 ; Parkins v Westminster City Council -LSB- 1998 -RSB- 1 EGLR 22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	35	In these cases some space or facility was -LRB- or was said to be -RRB- enjoyed in common between the tenant and another or others , and the question was whether that which was enjoyed in common was of such a character or of such significance as to preclude description of what was let as a separate dwelling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	36	In this context , distinctions were understandably and rightly drawn between living rooms , such as bedrooms and kitchens , and ancillary offices , such as bathrooms and lavatories : common enjoyment of the former but not the latter tended to weigh against recognition of the premises let as a separate dwelling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	37	9 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	38	None of these problems arises here . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	39	It is accepted -LRB- rightly , on the long-standing authority of Curl v Angelo -LSB- 1948 -RSB- 2 All ER 189 -RRB- that a single room may be a dwelling-house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	40	Mr Collins did not enjoy any space or facilities in common with other occupants . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	41	So the short question is whether room 403 , the room let -LRB- as it is assumed -RRB- to Mr Collins , is a dwelling-house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	42	10 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	43	Save that a dwelling-house may be a house or part of a house -LRB- 1988 Act , section 45 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- , no statutory guidance is given on the meaning of this now rather old-fashioned expression . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	44	But the concept is clear enough : it describes a place where someone dwells , lives or resides . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	45	In deciding in any given case whether the subject-matter of a letting falls within that description it is proper to have regard to the object of the legislation , directed as it is to giving a measure of security to those who make their homes in rented accommodation at the lower end of the housing market . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	46	It is not to be expected that such accommodation will necessarily offer all the amenities to be found in more expensive accommodation . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	47	11 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	48	The time at which it has to be judged whether premises are entitled to protection is when action is brought : Baker v Turner -LSB- 1950 -RSB- AC 401 at 415 , 419-420 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	49	At that stage it is necessary to consider the terms of the letting , the premises let and , in my opinion , the use made of them by the tenant : see section 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- b -RRB- of the 1988 Act , which recognises that circumstances may change during the currency of a tenancy . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	50	12 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	51	It appears , in the present case , that Mr Collins habitually used some electrical devices to warm food in his room before eating it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	52	The room was equipped with a power point which permitted that . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	53	I doubt if what he did could properly be described as cooking , but I do not think it matters . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	54	It is in my view plain on the evidence that this room was Mr Collins ' home , the place where he lived , and this is so whether he had his meals out or warmed up food to eat in his room or did a little rudimentary cooking or a bit of all three . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	55	If a room were so small and cramped as to be unable to accommodate a bed , I should be inclined to doubt whether it would qualify to be called a dwelling-house because , although sleeping in premises may not be enough to make them a dwelling-house , premises will not ordinarily be a dwelling-house unless the tenant sleeps there . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	56	But in my view the courts should be very wary of laying down inflexible rules which come to be mistaken for rules of law even though they are very largely conclusions of fact based on particular cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	57	That is what , as I think , has happened in this field , as Lord Millett has shown . 	lord bingham	lord millett	partagr	0.1	NAN
6	58	13 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	59	I am of the clear opinion that room 403 , if let to Mr Collins under a tenancy , was let as a separate dwelling-house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	60	For these short reasons , as well as those given by the Lord Chancellor , Lord Steyn and Lord Millett , I would allow this appeal . 	lord bingham	lord steyn	fullagr	0.1	NAN
6	60	For these short reasons , as well as those given by the Lord Chancellor , Lord Steyn and Lord Millett , I would allow this appeal . 	lord bingham	lord millett	fullagr	0.1	NAN
6	61	For reasons given by Lord Millett it is now inappropriate to remit the matter to the county court to determine whether there was a letting to Mr Collins . 	lord bingham	lord millett	partagr	0.1	NAN
6	62	On 25 September 2000 the landlord , Uratemp Ventures Ltd , withdrew its opposition to this appeal . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	63	I agree with the costs order proposed by my noble and learned friend . 	lord bingham	lord millett	outcome	0.1	NAN
6	64	------------- NEW JUDGE --------------- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.1	NAN
6	65	LORD STEYN 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	66	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	67	14 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	68	The question is whether a modest room in the Viscount Hotel , Prince of Wales Terrace , Kensington , occupied by Mr Collins is a dwelling-house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	69	It arises under section 1 of the Housing Act 1988 which speaks of `` a dwelling-house let as a separate dwelling '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	70	Since Mr Collins did not share accommodation or facilities with other persons in the hotel the only issue before the House is whether the room occupied by Mr Collins is a `` dwelling-house '' within the meaning of section 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	71	Part of a house may be a dwelling-house : section 45 -LRB- 1 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	72	And it is common ground that a bed-sitting room may be a dwelling-house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	73	But the majority in the Court of Appeal held that the particular room could not be a dwelling-house because of the absence of cooking facilities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	74	They treated the presence of cooking facilities as an indispensable requirement for a person 's home being a `` dwelling-house '' within the meaning of section 1 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	75	They thought that an observation in the leading judgment of Lord Templeman in Westminster City Council v Clarke -LSB- 1992 -RSB- 2 AC 288 , 299A , compelled this conclusion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	76	On this question 14 decisions of which 11 were of the Court of Appeal were cited to the House . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	77	Acknowledging that such `` autopsies '' have their value at times , Justice Cardozo famously described such examinations as `` wearisome and gruesome scenes '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	78	In my view a resort to first principles points to a route through this jungle of judicial glosses on the meaning of dwelling-house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	79	15 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	80	The starting point must be that `` dwelling-house '' is not a term of art . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	81	It is an ordinary word in the English language . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	82	While I accept that dictionaries can not solve issues of interpretation , it nevertheless is helpful to bear in mind that dwelling-house has for centuries been a word of wide import . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	83	It is often used interchangeably with lodging . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	84	It conveys the idea of a place where somebody lives : see Johnson 's Dictionary , s.v. `` dwelling-house '' and Murray 's Oxford English Dictionary , s.v. `` dwelling-house '' and `` lodging '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	85	In ordinary parlance a bed-sitting room where somebody habitually stays is therefore capable of being described as a dwelling-house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	86	So much for generalities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	87	The setting in which the word appears in the statute is important . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	88	It is used in legislation which is intended to afford a measure of protection to tenants under assured tenancies . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	89	This context makes it inappropriate for the court to place restrictive glosses on the word `` dwelling '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	90	On the contrary , as counsel appearing as amicus curiae accepted , the courts ought to interpret and apply the word `` dwelling-house '' in section 1 the 1988 Act in a reasonably generous fashion . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	91	16 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	92	The social phenomenon of the person `` Who friendless in a London lodging lives , Dines in a dingy chop-house '' -LRB- O.E.D. , s.v. `` chop-house '' -LRB- 1861 -RRB- -RRB- goes back a very long time indeed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	93	Dickens has described this world for us in unforgettable scenes . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	94	It is to be contrasted with the world of ostentatious dinner parties in smart houses mocked again and again by Trollope in many of his novels . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	95	The world has changed . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	96	In recent years there have been great social changes which reinforce the view that it is artificial to place on the word `` dwelling-house '' the restrictive gloss that for a room or accommodation to qualify it must have cooking facilities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	97	First , there are nowadays many more people who live alone . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	98	Specifically , a survey in Spring 2000 recorded that three in ten households in Great Britain comprised one person living alone , more than two and a half times the proportion in 1961 : National Statistics , Social Trends , No 31 , 2001 ed , 41 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	99	Secondly , there has been an explosion in the growth of self-service cafeteria , sandwich shops , takeaway shops , home delivery services and other fast food outlets . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	100	One only has to look under the entry ` Food and Drink Delivered ' in the most recent edition of the Yellow Pages for Central London -LRB- 2000/2001 -RRB- to realise the scale of this development in the eating habits of large numbers of people of all ages . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	101	And it is necessary to interpret section 1 of the 1988 Act in the world of today : R v Ireland -LSB- 1998 -RSB- AC 147 , 158C-G . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	102	17 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	103	The observation in Westminster City Council v Clarke -LSB- 1992 -RSB- 2 AC 288 , 299A by Lord Templeman , that `` a bed-sitting room with cooking facilities may be a separate dwelling-house even though bathroom and lavatory facilities might be elsewhere and shared with other people '' was not part of the ratio decidendi of the case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	104	The point was not in issue and the House heard no argument on it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	105	Moreover , as Mance LJ convincingly demonstrated in the Court of Appeal in the present case the observation was not justified by the earlier authorities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	106	In my view the observation in Westminster City Council v Clarke was too restrictive . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	107	A bed-sitting room which a tenant occupies as his home may be a dwelling even if he brings in all his meals or goes out for all his meals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	108	There is no authority binding on the House which precludes this construction . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.2	NAN
6	109	In these circumstances it follows that the room occupied by Mr Collins was his dwelling-house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
6	110	18 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
6	111	How such cases are approached by judges at the coal-face is important . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
6	112	On this point I agree with the succinct statement of principles by Lord Bingham of Cornhill in paragraphs 10 and 11 of his speech . 	lord steyn	lord bingham	partagr	0.3	NAN

6	120	I will only add the further observation that the complications in the present case , as in some earlier cases , have arisen from treating factual decisions as if they involved the formulation of propositions of law . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
6	121	Consistency of approach is required from case to case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

6	124	LORD MILLETT 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
6	125	My Lords , 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
6	126	21 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
6	127	This case calls upon your Lordships ' House to consider , not for the first time , the familiar expression `` part of a house let as a separate dwelling '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
6	128	This formula was the cornerstone of the Rent Acts and as such the daily fare of generations of county court and appellate judges for much of the last century . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
6	129	Yet this is the first time that that your Lordships have been called upon to decide the meaning of the word `` dwelling '' which forms part of the statutory formula . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
6	130	The question for decision is whether a part of a house can constitute a dwelling if cooking facilities are not available or cooking is prohibited by the terms of the letting . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
6	131	22 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
6	132	In Westminster City Council v Clarke -LSB- 1992 -RSB- 2 AC 288 Lord Templeman observed , at pp 298H-299A : `` Under the Rent Acts , in order to create a letting of part of a house as a separate dwelling there must be an agreement by which the occupier has exclusive possession of essential living rooms of a separate dwelling house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
6	133	Essential living rooms provide the necessary facilities for living , sleeping and cooking . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
6	134	Thus a bed-sitting room with cooking facilities may be a separate dwelling house even though bathroom and lavatory facilities might be elsewhere and shared with other people : see Neale v Del Soto -LSB- 1945 -RSB- KB 144 ; Cole v Harris -LSB- 1945 -RSB- KB 474 and Goodrich v Paisner -LSB- 1957 -RSB- AC 65 , 79 '' Following the guidance seemingly offered by this passage , the Court of Appeal in the present case -LRB- Peter Gibson LJ and Moore-Bick J , Mance LJ dissenting -RRB- felt constrained to hold that the presence of cooking facilities was an essential characteristic of a dwelling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN
6	135	The question for your Lordships is whether the absence of such facilities prevents a person 's home from being a `` dwelling '' within the meaning of the statutory formula and so precludes the occupier from enjoying security of tenure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.3	NAN

6	242	It was established very early that it was the state of things at the date when the proceedings were brought that mattered : Prout v Hunter -LSB- 1924 -RSB- 2 KB 736 -LRB- a point which the majority judgments in the Court of Appeal in the present case appear to have overlooked -RRB- and the use to which the tenant put the premises once he had furnished them was taken to be indicative of their character and the purpose for which they were let . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
6	243	The Housing Acts have extended security of tenure -LRB- and the application of the statutory formula -RRB- to furnished lettings , but the question still has to be determined as at the date when proceedings are brought , by which time the premises will almost invariably have been furnished whether or not they were originally so let .

6	247	Their legislative purpose was , therefore , very different from that of the Representation of the People Acts , and it could be dangerous to rely on the Nineteenth century cases particularly in relation to the word `` separate '' ; but there is no reason to be chary of doing so in relation to the word `` dwelling '' .

6	257	Scott LJ said that `` the word ` dwelling ' , on its true construction , included all the major activities of life , particularly sleeping , cooking and feeding '' and that as one of those activities , sleeping , was not being carried on there , the room was not a dwelling and the tenancy was not protected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
6	258	Given that the tenant did not sleep on the premises , the decision is unremarkable ; it is not an authority for the proposition that the tenant must also be able to cook there , for at the date when the proceedings were brought he did . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.6	NAN
6	259	The case is simply one where at the relevant time the tenant did not dwell in his own flat , but partly there and partly in his parents-in-law 's flat , so that his flat was not a dwelling but only part of a dwelling : -LRB- see McCarthy v Preston -LSB- 1951 -RSB- NZLR 1091 at pp. 1092-1093 -RRB- .

6	270	He said : , at p 190 : `` It must not be thought for a moment that I am throwing any doubt on the proposition that where there is a letting to a man of one room which is the only place where he moves and has his being , that circumstance will prevent the room being a `` dwelling '' within the meaning of the Act , but here one has the activities connected with the dwelling of all these people divided between two tenements .

6	311	Neale v Del Soto was explained and distinguished in Cole v Harris -LSB- 1945 -RSB- 1 KB 474 where the premises consisted of a bedroom , living room and kitchen on the first floor of a dwelling-house together with the use of a bathroom and w.c. in common with the landlord and the tenant of the second floor . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
6	312	The county court judge had understood Neale v Del Soto to lay down a rule of law that `` the sharing of any part of the accommodation included in the tenancy contract which is essential to the conception of a dwelling-house , according to ideas held at the present day , prevents the letting from being a letting of part of a house as a separate dwelling . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
6	313	See p 478 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
6	314	This test was accepted by Lawrence LJ in the Court of Appeal but was firmly rejected by the majority , who said that Neale v Del Soto laid down no such principle . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
6	315	They drew the line in a different place , between the sharing of living accommodation , which took the case outside the Acts , and the use of shared facilities such as a bathroom and w.c. , which did not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
6	316	They agreed that a w.c. was an essential part of the accommodation according to current modes of living , but it was not a living room . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
6	317	Mackinnon LJ set out the test , at p. 479 : `` It is , I think , difficult to formulate any principle of law which separates what I have called the contrasted conceptions of -LRB- 1 -RRB- a demise of part of a house as a separate dwelling , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- an agreement to share the use and occupation of a house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
6	318	But I think Morton LJ provides the best formula by saying that to create -LRB- 1 . -RRB- 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
6	319	there must be an agreement by which the occupier has the exclusive use of the essential living rooms of a separate dwelling-house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
6	320	After all , a dwelling-house is that in which a person dwells or lives , and it seems reasonable that a separate dwelling should be one containing essential living rooms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
6	321	A w.c. may be essential in modern days , but I do not think it is a living room , whereas a kitchen , I think , is '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
6	322	-LRB- original emphasis -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
6	323	This provides no support for the contention that the availability of cooking facilities is an essential part of the concept of a dwelling-house . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
6	324	Both the kitchen and the w.c. were essential to ordinary living , but the one formed part of the living accommodation and the other did not . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.7	NAN
6	325	Mackinnon LJ emphasised the word `` living , '' not the word `` essential '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	326	Morton LJ did not even use the word `` essential '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	327	He said , at p 485 : `` I think that the true test , where the tenant has the exclusive use of some rooms and shares certain accommodation with others , is as follows : there is a letting of part of a house as a separate dwelling , within the meaning of the relevant Acts if , and only if , the accommodation which is shared with others does not comprise any of the rooms which may fairly be described as ` living rooms ' or ` dwelling rooms . ' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	328	To my mind a kitchen is fairly described as a ` living room , ' and thus nobody who shares a kitchen can be said to be tenant of a part of a house let as a separate dwelling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	329	In many households the kitchen is the principal living room , where the occupants spend the greater part of the day . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	330	Very often it is the warmest part of the house and the family tend to congregate there for that reason . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	331	On the other hand , both the bathroom and the w.c. are rooms which are only visited on occasions for a specific purpose , and I think they may fairly be classed with such a room as a box-room , though no doubt it is not visited so often '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	332	This explains why the kitchen was classified as a living room . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	333	It was not because it afforded the tenant the ability to cook his meals there , but because it was one of the rooms in which he could fairly be said to live . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	334	A kitchenette measuring seven feet by six feet and containing inter alia a kitchen table was held to be a living room in Winters v Dance -LSB- 1949 -RSB- LJR 165 : but this is because it was treated as being merely a small kitchen . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	335	In Marsh Ltd v Cooper -LSB- 1969 -RSB- 1 WLR 803 an even smaller room , probably no more than an alcove , which contained no furniture and in which it was impossible to do anything except cook and wash up -LRB- the tenant did not eat there -RRB- , was held not to be a living room . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	336	48 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	337	These decisions lost much of their importance after the passing of section 8 of the Landlord and Tenant -LRB- Rent Control -RRB- Act 1949 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	338	Henceforth the sharing of accommodation did not preclude the application of the Rent Acts unless it was shared with the landlord . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	339	The distinction was the key to the legislative policy which lay behind the requirement that the dwelling be `` separate '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	340	As later cases explained , the right of a tenant to share his living accommodation was such an invasion of the landlord 's privacy that Parliament can not be taken to have intended that the tenant should have security of tenure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	341	This was not so in the case of a right to share the use of a bathroom or w.c. 49 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	342	Not every right to make use of the facilities of the kitchen was sufficient to take the case out of the Rent Acts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	343	In Hayward v Marshall -LSB- 1952 -RSB- 2 QB 89 the tenant took a letting of three unfurnished rooms together with a right to draw water in the kitchen and once a week to use the gas stove in the kitchen to boil washing . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	344	These limited rights did not amount to a right to use the kitchen as part of the living accommodation provided by the tenancy , and the tenancy was held to be protected . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	345	Unfortunately in the course of their judgments both Jenkins LJ and Sir Raymond Evershed MR repeated the expression `` essential living accommodation '' -LRB- without emphasising the word `` living '' -RRB- , and this became something of a mantra in later cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	346	Sir Raymond Evershed MR said , at p 99 : `` The distinction rests rather upon the view that the ordinary uses and purposes of a kitchen are essential manifestations of living or residence , so that if a tenant of rooms has to rely upon some licence for the exercise of those essential manifestations , he is not , as I have said , the tenant of a separate dwelling '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	347	This comes perilously close to reviving the test which was rejected in Cole v Harris . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	348	Taken out of context and divorced from the reasoning in Cole v Harris , the use of the word `` essential '' is potentially misleading . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	349	The cases did not decide that a kitchen is an essential part of a dwelling , so that premises which lack cooking facilities are not a dwelling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	350	What they decided was that the essential feature of a dwelling is that it contains living accommodation , and that every room which forms part of the tenant 's living accommodation , including the kitchen if there is one , forms part of his dwelling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	351	It is fallacious to reason that , because a kitchen is a living room and therefore part of any dwelling which possesses one , premises which do not possess a kitchen are not a dwelling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

6	359	Lord Morton of Henryton considered the use of the word `` essential '' in the present context to be `` not particularly appropriate '' ; while Lord Radcliffe regarded it as a gloss on the statute which either begged the question or confused the issue -LRB- see pp 84 , 91 -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	360	Lord Radcliffe could see nothing more satisfying in the definition which had been offered in the course of argument : `` a living room is a room wherein you cook , eat , sleep and put your feet on the fender . '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	361	As he observed : `` Why ever should courts of law tie themselves down in this way ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

6	364	The House confirmed the test laid down by the majority of the Court of Appeal in Cole v Harris in the face of an attempt to revive the test which had been adopted by the county court judge and Lawrence LJ in that case . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	365	It was argued that the question should be : `` Do the rooms so let in fact contain the essentials of a separate dwelling , or is what is let a separate dwelling only if you include with it the other rights or conveniences which the tenancy agreement confers ? '' 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN

6	368	In Haywood v Marshall -LSB- 1952 -RSB- 2 QB 89 counsel had suggested that there might be a distinction between a concurrent sharing and a consecutive sharing , only the former being sufficient to take the tenancy out of the protection of the Rent Acts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.8	NAN
6	369	This idea was eventually taken up in Goodrich v Paisner , where the tenant 's right to have the occasional use of a bedroom in common with the landlord was held not to exclude the application of the Rent Acts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
6	370	It was assumed that the tenancy agreement did not contemplate simultaneous user ; there would have had to be some further arrangement by which there would be separate user at successive times . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

6	380	The restrictions placed on their use of the rooms , the facts that they were not entitled to any particular room and might be required to share a room , and above all the fact that the grant of exclusive possession would be inconsistent with the social purpose for which the accommodation was provided , all pointed to this conclusion .

6	384	It is certainly not authority for the proposition that a room is not a dwelling in the absence of cooking facilities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
6	385	In the first place , even a clear statement to that effect would have been obiter , since the room in question possessed them . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

6	391	The premises as a whole were not let as a separate dwelling , since while they provided cooking facilities the tenant did not have exclusive possession of them ; nor was the bedroom alone let as a separate dwelling , since while he did have exclusive possession of the room , it did not provide cooking facilities . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
6	392	Whether the correct view was that the tenant was entitled to occupy the whole of the premises or only the bedroom , there was no letting of a separate dwelling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

6	402	in Westminster City Council v Clarke -LSB- 1992 -RSB- 2 AC 288 Lord Templeman was merely summarising the result of the earlier cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
6	403	It was natural , but unfortunate , that in doing so he repeated , at 299 , the expression `` essential living rooms '' , an expression which , as I have already explained , is misleading when taken out of its original context . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
6	404	In agreeing with him , the other members of the House can not have intended to replace the statutory language by a rigid test which makes the availability of cooking facilities an essential precondition for security of tenure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
6	405	This would place a gloss on the statute which is not justified by the language or purpose of the statute or the decided cases ; and once again revive the heresy , twice previously rejected , that a room or set of rooms must possess `` all the features essential to the conception of a dwelling house '' in order to attract security of tenure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
6	406	Moreover such a conclusion would be productive of great difficulties in future cases . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
6	407	It would be necessary to consider just what is sufficient to constitute `` cooking facilities '' . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN

6	409	What more is required ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
6	410	And why should even this much be necessary to attract security of tenure ? 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
6	411	The legislative purpose of the Rent and Housing Acts is to protect people in the occupation of their homes , not to encourage them to cook their own meals . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	0.9	NAN
6	412	58 . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
6	413	In my opinion the position is relatively straightforward . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
6	414	The first step is to identify the subject-matter of the tenancy agreement . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
6	415	If this is a house or part of a house of which the tenant has exclusive possession with no element of sharing , the only question is whether , at the date when the proceedings were brought , it was the tenant 's home . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
6	416	If so , it was his dwelling . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
6	417	-LRB- He must also occupy it as his only or principal home , but that is a separate requirement -RRB- . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
6	418	If the tenancy agreement grants , in addition , the right to the shared use of other rooms , the question is whether the room or rooms of which he has exclusive possession are his dwelling place or only part of it . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
6	419	This depends on the nature and extent of the right and the character of the other rooms . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
6	420	The right to occupy a living room in common with and at the same time as the landlord is such an invasion of his privacy that Parliament can not be taken to have intended that the tenant should enjoy security of tenure . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
6	421	For this purpose a kitchen is a living room , at least if it is possible to occupy it and not merely cook and wash up in it ; so that a right to occupy a kitchen -LRB- as distinct from a right to make some limited use of its facilities -RRB- in common with the landlord will take the tenancy out of the Acts . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
6	422	The presence or absence of cooking facilities in the part of the premises of which the tenant has exclusive occupation is not relevant . 	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	NAN
