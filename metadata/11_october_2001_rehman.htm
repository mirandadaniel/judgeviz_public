<hr>
<p>		The security of the United Kingdom could be threatened indirectly by activities against other states. No particular standard of proof was appropriate to the Secretary of State's executive decision as to whether it was conducive to the public good that a person should be deported.<br>
	The House of Lords dismissed an appeal by Shafiq Ur Rehman from the Court of Appeal (Lord Woolf MR, Laws LJ and Harrison J) [2000] 3 WLR 1240 who had allowed an appeal by the Secretary of State from the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (&quot;SIAC&quot;). SIAC had allowed the immigrant's appeal against the Secretary of State's decision to deport him.</p>
<p>	LORD SLYNN OF HADLEY said that SIAC had held that the conduct of the immigrant relied on by the Secretary of State had to be targeted at this country or its citizens and that the test was whether it had been shown to a high degree of probability that he was a danger to national security. What could be &quot;conducive to the public good&quot; was not defined in the 1971 Act and it was primarily a matter for the Secretary of State's discretion. There had to be some possibility of risk or danger to the security or well-being of the United Kingdom, its people or its system of government, but the risk did not have to be the result of a &quot;direct threat&quot; or action &quot;targeted at&quot; the United Kingdom. In contemporary world conditions, action against a foreign state could indirectly affect the security of the United Kingdom. Preventative or precautionary action might be justified. Where the Secretary of State relied on specific acts that had already occurred, they should be established to the civil standard of proof, but, although there had to be material on which he could proportionately and reasonably conclude that there was a real possibility of activities harmful to national security, establishing a degree of probability did not seem relevant to his reaching a conclusion, as a matter of executive judgment, as to whether deportation would be conducive to the public good.<br>
	LORD STEYN, LORD HOFFMANN, LORD CLYDE and LORD HUTTON delivered opinions concurring in dismissing the appeal.</p>
