      <!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Work 
      carried out by a tenant reconverting a house to a single dwelling from a 
      conversion into flats by a previous tenant was an &quot;improvement&quot; 
      which increased the value of the house at the valuation date when the tenant 
      gave notice of his claim to acquire the freehold under the Leasehold Reform 
      Act 1967; he was accordingly entitled, under s 9(1A) (d), to a diminution 
      in the purchase price by the extent to which the house value was thereby 
      increased. <br>
      The House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by the tenant, Mr Peter 
      Shalson, from the Court of Appeal [2003] Ch 110 dismissing his appeal from 
      the Lands Tribunal (Mr N J Rose FRICS) whereby he uphold the decision of 
      a Leasehold Valuation Tribunal that works by the tenant and certain of his 
      predecessors at 98, Hamilton Terrace, London NW8 reconverting the house 
      to a single dwelling from the flats to which it had been converted in 1947 
      fell to be disregarded in determining the price to be paid by the tenant 
      in purchasing the freehold from the landlord, the Keepers and Governors 
      of the Free Grammar School of John Lyon.</font>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LORD HOFFMANN said 
        that the language of s 9(1A)(d) was clear. A diminution in the open market 
        value was to be allowed only by the extent to which that value had been 
        increased by &quot;any improvement&quot; which had been carried out by 
        the tenant or a predecessor at their own expense. To secure a reduction 
        the tenant had first to identify such works and secondly satisfy the tribunal 
        that but for them the house and premises would have been worth less.&quot;Improvement&quot; 
        in general meant additions or alterations which were not mere repairs 
        or renewals: it was a physical not an economic concept, referring to the 
        works themselves and not to the effect, if any, they had on the value 
        of the premises. On the second condition: what did it mean to say that 
        the value of the house and premises had been increased by the improvement 
        ? It signified a simple causal relationship: but for the improvement, 
        the house and premises would have been worth less. The comparison was 
        between the value of the house as it stood and what its value would have 
        been if the improvement had not been made. By that test the conversion 
        works and the reconversion were both improvements but the former made 
        no difference to the house value at the valuation date, because they had 
        ceased to exist. On the other hand, if reconversion had not taken place, 
        the 1947 improvements would still have existed and the house would have 
        been worth less. To the extent that it was worth more, the tenant was 
        entitled to a reduction in the open market value.<br>
        LORD BINGHAM OF CORNHILL and LORD MILLETT delivered concurring opinions; 
        LORD STEYN agreed with LORD HOFFMANN, LORD BINGHAM and LORD MILLETT; and 
        LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE agreed with LORD HOFFMANN.</font></p>
