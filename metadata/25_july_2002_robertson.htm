        <p><b>Robertson v Fife Council</b></p>
        <p><b>HL: Lord Slynn of Hadley, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, Lord Nicholls 
          of Birkenhead, Lord Hope of Craighead and Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough: 
          25 July 2002</b><br>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p> A local authority in Scotland was not entitled to take into account 
          a person's capital when deciding whether to provide residential nursing 
          care for that person under s 13A of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968. 
          <br>
          The House of Lords so held in allowing an appeal by Mrs Mary Robertson 
          from the order of the First Division of the Court of Session (the Lord 
          President (Rodger) and Lord Bonomy; Lord Weir dissenting) 2001 SLT 708 
          refusing her reclaiming motion against the decision of the Lord Ordinary 
          (Lady Cosgrove)2000 SLT 1226 dismissing her petition for judicial review 
          of Fife Council's decision, having assessed her as needing residential 
          care with nursing, to refuse to enter into a funding arrangement for 
          her to receive such care by reason of its determination that she had 
          notional capital, said to have arisen from her transfer of the ownership 
          of her house to her children in 1995, in excess of &pound;16,000. <br>
          S 12(1)(2) of the 1968 Act imposed a duty on local authorities in Scotland 
          to promote social welfare and provide assistance, including residential 
          accommodation, to relevant persons. By s 12(3A): &quot;In determining 
          for the purposes of this section whether to provide assistance by way 
          of residential accommodation to a person, a local authority shall disregard 
          so much of the person's capital as does not exceed [&pound;16,000].&quot; 
          <br>
          S 13A imposed a duty on authorities to provide residential accommodation 
          with nursing to persons in need of such accommodation.<br>
          <br>
          LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD said that Fife had argued that statutory authority 
          for their decision was to be found in s 12(3A). However, the provision 
          of residential accommodation with nursing under s 13A was a separate 
          exercise from the provision of residential accommodation under s 12. 
          The powers and duties described in the two sections were different. 
          The duty to be performed under s 13A was not to be seen as a particular 
          example of the general duties to be performed under s 12 but as a separate 
          and distinct duty. S 12(3A) did not apply on a s 13A determination. 
          Further, the direction in s 12(3A) to &quot;disregard&quot; capital 
          under the limit in the determination to which s 12(3A) referred did 
          not indicate that capital above the limit was to be brought into account 
          at that stage. <br>
          LORD SLYNN OF HADLEY, LORD MACKAY OF CLASHFERN, LORD NICHOLLS OF BIRKENHEAD 
          and LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH agreed.<br>
