      judge in the Crown Court was allowed to conduct two separate preparatory 
      hearings in respect of different defendants charged with criminal offences 
      in the same indictment.<br>
      The House of Lords so held in allowing an appeal by the Crown from the order 
      of Andrew Smith J, sitting in the Administrative Court of the Queen's Bench 
      Division, granting a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum to the respondent, 
      Andreas Kanaris, one of 11 defendants awaiting trial on a single indictment. 
      </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> LORD HUTTON said 
        that under reg 5(6B) of the Prosecution of Offences (Custody Time Limits) 
        Regulations 1987 the maximum period that the respondent could be held 
        in custody before the start of his trial was 182 days. That period had 
        been due to expire on 21 October 2001. On 7 September 2001 a hearing in 
        the case of all 11 defendants took place before a judge in the Crown Court 
        which the prosecution applied to be treated as a preparatory hearing under 
        s 29 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996. S 30 of that 
        Act provided that if a judge ordered a preparatory hearing the trial would 
        start with that hearing. The judge began a preparatory hearing in respect 
        of all the defendants except the respondent, whose counsel had raised 
        an issue as to his fitness to plead, and one other defendant who was applying 
        for the charges against him to be dismissed. Thereafter, on 5 October 
        2001, when the respondent's fitness to plead was no longer an issue, the 
        judge held a preparatory hearing in respect of him. The judge in the Administrative 
        Court had held, inter alia, that a preparatory hearing could not take 
        place against only some defendants charged on an indictment and, since 
        in his view there had been no valid preparatory hearing, the reg 5(6B) 
        custody time limit period had expired. <br>
        In His Lordship's opinion the judge in the Administrative Court had erred. 
        The law was clear that where a number of defendants were charged in the 
        same indictment or in the same count, each defendant was charged with 
        having himself committed an offence. There was no rule of statute or practice 
        which prevented a judge from ordering a separate preparatory hearing in 
        respect of one defendant jointly charged with other defendants in the 
        same indictment if he considered that it was in the interests of justice 
        to do so. The present case was one where the judge in the Crown Court 
        had been fully entitled to take the view that it was desirable to make 
        such an order. <br>
        His Lordship added that custody time limits were an important safeguard 
        for accused persons and the effect of a decision to hold a preparatory 
        hearing on an accused person's custody time limit had to be given careful 
        consideration by the prosecution and judge.<br>
        LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD delivered a concurrring speech and LORD NICHOLLS 
        OF BIRKENHEAD, LORD SLYNN OF HADLEY and LORD STEYN agreed.</font><br>
