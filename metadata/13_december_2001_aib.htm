          HL: Lord Irvine of Lairg LC, Lord Hutton, Lord Millett, Lord Scott of 
          Foscote and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: 13 December 2001</b></p>



<hr>
        <p> Under the terms of a joint mortgage taken out by two business partners 
          which provided that: "If the expression ‘the mortgagor' includes more 
          than one person it shall be construed as referring to all and/or any 
          one of those persons and the obligations of such persons hereunder shall 
          be joint and several" and "The mortgagor hereby covenants with … the 
          bank… that it will on demand pay or discharge to the bank … all sums 
          of money … advanced to the mortgagor by the bank…". one partner was liable 
          to the bank for the personal indebtedness, unconnected with the partnership, 
          incurred by the other partner. <br>
          <br>
          The House of Lords so held in dismissing an appeal by the second defendant, 
          Mr Alan Clive Gold from a decision of the Court of Appeal (Morritt and 
          Sedley LJJ and Sir Christopher Slade) given on 27 June 2000 dismissing 
          his appeal from a decision of Jacob J given on 15 March 1999 by which 
          he found that the second defendant was liable to the plaintiff bank, 
          AIB Group (UK) Plc (formerly Allied Irish Banks Plc and AIB Finance 
          Ltd) for debts incurred by the first defendant, Mr Martin. <br>
          <br>
          LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE said that it had been contended for the second 
          defendant that because "the mortgagor", as defined, included more than 
          one person it should be construed as referring first to the two of them, 
          next to one of them, and then to the other of them. If that were right, 
          the second defendant would not be liable to repay sums advanced to the 
          first defendant alone. However, the relevant clause started with a joint 
          covenant by the defendants. It was not three separate covenants, one 
          by them jointly and one by each of them individually. It was a single 
          joint covenant. Their liability under that joint covenant was declared 
          to be joint and several. That dealt with the effect of their joint covenant. 
          It did not turn a single covenant into three covenants. The critical 
          issue was not whether the defendants, as well as jointly covenanting 
          to pay, had severally covenanted to pay. The critical issue is what 
          had they covenanted to pay? Under the clause they had covenanted to 
          pay "all sums of money ... advanced to the mortgagor by the bank ... 
          ". The mortgagor meant the two of them and/or each of them. So they had 
          covenanted to pay all sums of money advanced by the bank to the two 
          of them and/or to each of them. They had covenanted to pay the sums 
          advanced by the bank to first defendant alone as well as the sums advanced 
          by the bank to them jointly. The clause constituted a covenant by the 
          first defendant and the second defendant to pay their joint debts to 
          the bank, to pay the first defendant's debts to the bank and to pay 
          the second defendant's debts to the bank. <br>
          <br>
          LORD IRVINE OF LAIRG LC, LORD HUTTON and LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY delivered 
          concurring judgments. LORD MILLETT delivered a judgment concurring in 
          the result. </p>
