<p><b>M (a minor) (by her father and litigation friend B) v Secretary of State for Social Security</b></p>
<p><b>HL: Lord Bingham of Cornhill, Lord Nichols of Birkenhead, Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough, Lord Millett and Lord Scott of Foscote: 5 July 2001</b>
<hr>
The transitional provisions in reg 12(3) of the Social Security (Persons from Abroad) Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations 1996 preserved the accrued rights to disability living allowance of those who were entitled immediately before the coming into force of the Regulations, but did not have the effect of extending the amount or duration of a claimant's entitlement beyond the amount or term for which it had been awarded, nor did it apply to new and repeat claims made after the Regulations came into force.<br>
	The House of Lords so held, dismissing an appeal by M, a child aged nine, from a decision of the Court of Appeal (Peter Gibson, Judge LJJ and Ferris J) on 30 November 1999 affirming the decision of the Social Security Commissioner on 21 June 1999 setting aside a decision of the Burnley Social Security Appeal Tribunal on 15 April 1997 allowing her appeal from the adjudication officer's ruling that she was not entitled to disability living allowance.</p>
<p>	LORD MILLETT said that M was a severely disabled child born in Pakistan and brought to the UK by her parents in 1993 aged one. On 8 September 1993 she claimed disability living allowance. She satisfied the conditions of residence and presence in Great Britain prescribed by reg 2 of the Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) Regulations 1991. On 16 December 1992 she was awarded an allowance for three years until 26 September 1996. On 5 February 1996 reg 4 of the 1996 Regulations imposed the additional condition of entitlement to the allowance that a claimant's right to reside or remain in Great Britain be not subject to any limitation or condition. M did not satisfy that condition having remained beyond the time limited by her leave to enter the UK. M and her parents were granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK on 19 July 2000 and M now satisfied the conditions for the allowance but only since 19 July. The present dispute concerned her entitlement to the allowance between 27 September 1996 and 18 July 2000. On 7 June 1996 in anticipation of the expiry of her award M claimed an allowance for a further period. The adjudication officer ruled that she did not satisfy the additional condition imposed by reg 4 and was not entitled to a further award. Her appeal was effectively an appeal from R v Chief Adjudication Officer, Ex p B [1999] 1 WLR 1695, CA and turned on the true construction of reg 12(3) of the 1996 Regulations which provided that where before the 1996 Regulations came into force a person was receiving disability living allowance under the 1991 Regulations those Regulations should, until such time as his entitlement to that benefit was reviewed under s 30 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, have effect as if reg 4 of the 1996 Regulations had not been made. The question for decision was whether the 1991 Regulations applied in their unamended form to a claim to disability living allowance made after the 1996 Regulations came into force by a claimant in receipt of the allowance immediately before that date under an award for a fixed term which had since expired.<br>
	His Lordship said that reg 12 was concerned to save or preserve accrued rights to benefit to which a claimant was entitled immediately before the amending Regulations came into force. The extent of the disapplication of reg 4 had to be derived from the terms of the precondition and the evident purpose of the regulation. Those limited it to the particular claimant's accrued right to the particular benefit which he was receiving immediately before the amending Regulations came into force. In M's case that was a right to disability living allowance under an award which entitled her to receive the allowance of a stated amount for a stated period of three years. That was the full extent of her accrued entitlement which it was the purpose of reg 12(3) to save, and reg 4 was disapplied only in regard to that entitlement. Reg 12(3) did not have the effect of extending the amount or duration of a claimant's award beyond the amount or term for which it was awarded. It preserved accrued rights to benefits under awards which predated the coming into force of the 1996 Regulations but did not apply to new and repeat claims made thereafter. Such claims had to be decided in accordance with the circumstances obtaining at the time of the new claim and any requirements imposed by the regulations then in force. R v Chief Adjudication Officer, Ex p B was correctly decided.</p>
<p>	LORD BINGHAM OF CORNHILL delivered a speech agreeing that the appeal be dismissed. LORD NICHOLLS OF BIRKENHEAD, LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH and LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE agreed with Lord Millett.</p>
