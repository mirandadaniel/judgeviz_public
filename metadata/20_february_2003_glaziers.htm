      The requirement that &quot;a statement setting out every amount&quot; of 
      the cost of insurance services supplied in association with a supply of 
      goods be provided to the customer pursuant to Note (5) of Group 2 of Sch 
      9 to the Value Added Tax Act 1994, as substituted by s 38 of the Finance 
      Act 1997, thus enabling the insurance cost to be exempt from VAT, was satisfied 
      when a formula for the calculation of such cost was provided. The supplier 
      was not required to provide the precise monetary figure.<br>
      The House of Lords so held (Lord Slynn of Hadley dissenting) in allowing 
      an appeal by the taxpayer, C R Smith Glaziers (Dunfermline) Ltd, against 
      a decision of the Inner House of the Court of Session (Lord Kirkwood, Lord 
      Cameron of Lochbroom and Lord Abernethy) of 16 February 2001 (2001 SC 646) 
      dismissing the taxpayer's appeal from a decision of the Edinburgh VAT and 
      Duties Tribunal (J Gordon Reid QC, RLH Crawford and JD Crerar) dated 22 
      October 1999 concerning an assessment to VAT by the Commissioners of Customs 
      and Excise.<br>
      <br>
      LORD HOFFMANN said that the taxpayer supplied double glazing. It gave a 
      10 year guarantee supported by an insurance policy to protect the customer 
      against the risk of its insolvency. The charge to the customer consisted 
      of the price of the double glazing and additional charges for the insurance 
      premium and services provided in arranging and administering the policy. 
      The supply of those additional services was prima facie exempt from VAT. 
      The question was whether the contractual document contained the &quot;statements&quot; 
      required by Note (5). There was no dispute that it stated the amount of 
      the premium, which was specified as &pound;16. But the Commissioners said 
      that it did not contain a statement &quot;setting out every amount that 
      the customer is&#133;required to pay otherwise than by way of such premium&quot;. 
      A reference to &quot;10%&quot; of the &quot;total contract price&quot; was 
      in their submission inadequate. Looking at the matter as an ordinary question 
      of construction, which required one to consider the language against the 
      background of the whole statutory scheme, the arguments were finely balanced. 
      What decisively tilted the balance against the Commissioners' construction 
      was the European dimension. The exemption of insurance-related services 
      from VAT was a mandatory requirement of art 13B(a) of the Sixth Council 
      Directive on turnover taxes (77/388/EEC) of 17 May 1977. The only way in 
      which, conformably with the Directive, the United Kingdom could justify 
      rules which deprived such services of exemption was by reliance on the provision 
      that exemption should be under conditions which member states had laid down 
      &quot;for the purpose of ensuring the correct and straightforward application 
      of the exemptions and of preventing any possible evasion, avoidance or abuse&quot;. 
      However, there was great difficulty in seeing how a provision insisting 
      not merely that the documents disclosed the apportionment of consideration 
      but did so in a particular form could be said to be &quot;suitable for the 
      purpose&quot; of preventing avoidance. Any additional formal requirement, 
      non-compliance with which might result in denial of exemption, was an additional 
      burden. A requirement that information be communicated in any particular 
      form was more burdensome than a requirement that it might be communicated 
      in any form. And where, as in the instant case, the addition of a requirement 
      of form appeared to serve no legitimate purpose, it was also disproportionate. 
      The Commissioners' construction did not conform to the terms of the Sixth 
      Directive and it was therefore necessary to adopt the alternative construction 
      which did. </font>
