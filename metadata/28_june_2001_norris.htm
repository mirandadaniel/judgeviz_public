<p>	In proceedings in the High Court to enforce a confiscation order made in the Crown Court under the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 which required a convicted drug trafficker to deliver up property which the Crown Court had determined was part of his assets (having rejected evidence from his wife that it belonged to her), it was not an abuse of the process for the wife to seek to re-open the question of ownership in the High Court proceedings.<br>
	The House of Lords so held in allowing an appeal by the wife from the order of the Court of Appeal [2000] 1 WLR 1094 upholding the refusal of Latham J to allow her to re-open the issue of ownership of her matrimonial home which was registered in her name.<br>
	The husband had been convicted in the Crown Court of drug trafficking offences in 1996.  Before sentence the Customs and Excise Commissioners had  applied for a confiscation order, making it necessary to assess his realisable property, which included any property he had given away during the previous six years.  The wife gave evidence on his behalf that the matrimonial home belonged either wholly or substantially to her by reason of her contributions to the purchase price of earlier matrimonial homes, the proceeds of which had been used to buy the house in question.  The judge disbelieved her evidence and made the confiscation order on the basis that the house formed part of the husband's realisable property.  On the Customs and Excise's application to the High Court under s 11 of the 1986 Act to enforce the order, the judge appointed a receiver.  The judge dismissed the wife's application to vary the order on the ground that she had an interest in the house.  The Court of Appeal upheld that decision on the ground that it would be an abuse of the process for the court to allow a third party to relitigate issues which had been already decided in the Crown Court on substantially the same evidence and submissions and where the third party, although not a party to the criminal proceedings and not separately represented, had had a fair opportunity to put her case. </p>
<p>	LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH said that the scheme of the 1986 Act was that the Crown Court, having convicted a person of a drug trafficking offence, was to assess the value of the convicted person's proceeds of drug trafficking and the amount of his realisable property for the purpose of making the necessary confiscation order against him in the criminal proceedings, whereas the subsequent enforcement of that order by way of empowering a receiver to take possession of the realisable property was a matter for the High Court as part of its civil jurisdiction, so allowing any assertion of interest in the property by a third party before its disposal.  A third party was not precluded from asserting his interest before the High Court, in reliance on the right to make representations to that court under s 11(8), by reason of having previously made assertions as to the ownership of the property when called as a witness for the defence in the criminal proceedings.  Since the wife had evidence to raise an arguable case that she had at least an interest in the matrimonial home, she was making proper use of the civil jurisdiction to protect her proprietary rights within the intention of the 1986 Act and there was no misuse of the litigational process such as would require her application to be dismissed as an abuse of the process.<br>
	The 1986 Act had been repealed and replaced by revised legislation but the treatment of third party rights and the role of the civil courts did not appear to have materially altered.<br>
	LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD delivered a concurring speech and LORD BROWNE-WILKINSON, LORD CLYDE and LORD HUTTON agreed.</p>
