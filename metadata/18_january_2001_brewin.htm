<p> The consideration for which a company entered into a transaction for the purposes of  s 238 of the Insolvency Act 1986 could include the value of a collateral agreement entered into by the company with a third party.   In assessing the value in money or money's worth of the agreement which constituted the consideration the court was entitled to give precedence to reality over speculation and to have regard to events which occurred after the agreement had been entered into.<br>
	The House of Lords so held, dismissing an appeal by the defendants, Brewin Dolphin Bell Lawrie Ltd (formerly Brewin Dolphin &amp; Co Ltd) and Private Capital Group Ltd (&quot;PCG&quot;) from the Court of Appeal [1999] 1 WLR  2052 which had affirmed Evans-Lombe J [1998] BCLC 700. He held on the application of the first plaintiff,  Ian Peter Phillips, the liquidator of the second plaintiff A.J. Bekhor &amp; Co(&quot;AJB&quot;), for declaratory relief pursuant to s 238 of the Insolvency Act 1968, that the sale of the second plaintiff 's business was at an undervalue.<br>
	In November 1989 AJB entered into linked agreements with Brewin Dolphin and with its parent company, PCG, to sell AJB's stockbroking business to Brewin Dolphin. In October 1989 AJB sold its business and assets to Bekhor Securities Ltd (&quot;BSL&quot;), a wholly owned subsidiary, for a consideration of &#163;1. Thus under one of the November agreements with Brewer Dolphin AJB transferred its shares in BSL to Brewin Dolphin;   AJB received in return (i) from Brewin Dolphin, their assumption of AJB's obligations to its employees,  and (ii) from PCG, under one of the November agreements between AJB and PCG, a covenant by PCG to pay AJB &#163;312,500 per annum for four years. That agreement was expressed to be a computer equipment leasing agreement and the payments to be rent payable for the right to use the equipment. The total  to be paid was &#163;1.25 million, which was the sum negotiated for the sale of AJB's stockbroking business.  However the head leases had been terminated in early 1990 and the computer equipment was recovered by the lessors. PCG therefore treated the sublease as having been brought to an end by the termination of the head leases and consequently made none of the &#163;312,500 payments. </p>
<p>	LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE said that s 238(4)(b) of the 1986 Act did not stipulate by whom the consideration was to be provided but simply directed attention to the consideration for which the company had entered into the transaction.  The identification of that &quot;consideration&quot; was a question of fact and could include a collateral agreement with a third party. On the facts here it was plain that the consideration for the BSL shares was, apart from obligations assumed by Brewin Dolphin under the share sale agreement itself, the entry by PCG into the sublease agreement. In valuing that agreement as at November 1989, the critical uncertainty was whether the sublease would survive  long enough to enable all or any of the payments to fall due. Where events on which the uncertainties depended had actually happened, it seemed unsatisfactory and unnecessary for the court to wear blinkers and pretend that it did not know what had happened..  Taking into account the events which took place in early 1990, the value of  PGC's covenant in the sublease was nil. Therefore, the value of the consideration for which AJB entered into the share sale agreement was confined to the value of the consideration under that agreement. It had not been demonstrated that the judge misdirected himself in valuing AJB's assets at &#163;1,050,000.  AJB succeeded in establishing that for the purposes of s 238 it had entered into a transaction at an undervalue.</p>
<p>	LORD STEYN, LORD HUTTON, LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH and LORD MILLETT agreed.
