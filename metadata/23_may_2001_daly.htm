<p>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Daly</p>

<p>		A policy requiring that prisoners must always be absent when privileged legal correspondence held by them in their cells was examined by prison officers was unlawful.<br>
	The House of Lords so held in allowing an appeal by the applicant, a serving prisoner, from the decision of the Court of Appeal on 25 May 1999 dismissing his application for judicial review of the decision of the Secretary of State for the Home Department (acting by the Director General of the Prison Service) to apply a policy of cell searches in all closed prisons in England and Wales which required prison staff, as part of the search, to examine (but not read) prisoners' legally privileged correspondence in their absence.</p>
<p>	LORD BINGHAM OF CORNHILL said that the policy infringed the applicant's common law right to legal professional privilege because there would necessarily be occasions when prison officers would do more than merely examine prisoners' legal documents, and apprehension that they might do so was bound to inhibit a prisoner's willingness to communicate freely with his legal adviser.  The current blanket policy could not be justified as a necessary and proper response to the acknowledged need to maintain security, order and discipline in prisons and to prevent crime.  Although any prisoner who attempted to intimidate staff or disrupt a search of his cell, or whose past conduct had shown that he was likely to do so, might properly be excluded even while his privileged correspondence was examined so as to ensure the efficacy of the search, there was no justification for routinely excluding all prisoners, whether intimidatory or disruptive or not, while that part of the search was conducted.  Accordingly, the policy, in so far as it provided that prisoners must always be absent when privileged legal correspondence held by them in their cells was examined, was unlawful.  It was similarly in breach of art 8.1 of  the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as scheduled to the Human Rights Act 1998, which gave the applicant a right to respect for his correspondence.  While interference with that right by a public authority could be permitted if in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society in the interests of  the prevention of disorder or crime, the policy interfered with that right to an extent much greater than necessity required.<br>
	LORD STEYN, LORD COOKE OF THORNDON, LORD HUTTON and LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE agreed.</p>
