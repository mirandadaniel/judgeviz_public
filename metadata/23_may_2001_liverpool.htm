<p>	&quot;Taxable supplies&quot; in reg 30(2)(d) of the Value Added Tax (General) Regulations 1985 meant supplies made in the United Kingdom and did not include out-of-country supplies which, if they had been made in the UK, would have been subject to value added tax.<br>
	The House of Lords so held in dismissing an appeal by the taxpayer, Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, from a decision of the Court of Appeal (Nourse, Judge and Tuckey LJJ) [1999] STC 424 on 17 March 1999 allowing an appeal by the Customs and Excise Commissioners from a decision of Carnwath J [1998] STC 274 who on 30 January 1998 dismissed the commissioners' appeal from a decision dated 10 October 1996 of a value added tax tribunal sitting in Manchester that the commissioners were wrong to hold that certain supplies made by the taxpayer were not to be treated as taxable supplies for the purpose of calculating the deductible proportion of input tax under partial exemption calculations.</p>
<p>	LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE said that the issue was the method to be adopted for calculating the amount of input tax for which the institute were entitled to credit when making their VAT returns. Since 1995 the institute had provided educational services in the field of performing arts. The supply of educational services did not attract VAT and was an exempt supply. But over three periods the institute provided advertising and publicity services to a German company, Grundig AG. The supply of those services, if the place of supply had been the UK, would have attracted VAT. However, by virtue of art 16 of the Value Added Tax (Place of Supply of Services) Order 1992, supplies of advertising were treated as made where the recipient belonged, in this case in Germany. So the institute's supply of advertising services to Grundig was an out-of-country supply that would, had it been made in this country, have attracted VAT. In order to supply goods or services that attracted VAT (the output tax) it would almost always be necessary for the supplier to utilise goods and services that had been supplied to him, and that, in turn, would have attracted VAT (the input tax). The taxpayer was entitled to deduct the input tax on the goods and services supplied to him and that he had used for the purpose of making goods and services that he supplied from the output tax on those goods and services. He had to account to the Commissioners of Customs and Excise only for the net amount. The purpose of the Sixth Council Directive (77/388/EEC) was to harmonise the VAT laws of member states and art 17 dealt with deductions of input tax. The problem arose in relation to so-called &quot;residual input tax&quot;, ie input tax on goods and services which were used indiscriminately for all transactions of the taxable person, some of which attracted VAT and some which might fall outside the VAT system. Art 17(5) proposed a formula in art 19 but allowed member states some flexibility to make other provision. S 1 of the Value Added Tax Act 1983 provided for VAT to be charged &quot;on the supply of goods and services in the United Kingdom&quot; and s 2 said that &quot;a taxable supply is a supply of goods or services made in the United Kingdom other than an exempt suppy&quot;. Reg 30(2)(d) of the 1985 Regulations provided that &quot;there shall be attributed to taxable supplies such proportion of the input tax on such of those goods or services as are used or to be used by him in making both taxable and exempt supplies as bears the same ratio to the total of such input tax as the value of taxable supplies made by him bears to the value of all supplies made by him in the period&quot;. It was dealing with residual input tax and prescribed a value-based method of apportionment. &quot;Taxable supplies&quot; had surely to have the same meaning there as elsewhere in reg 30. It had to be limited to supplies in the United Kingdom which were taxable. It had therefore to exclude exempt supplies, out-of-country supplies and supplies made otherwise than in the course or furtherance of a business. None of those constituted &quot;taxable supplies&quot;. In reg 30(2)(d) &quot;all supplies&quot; did not include include out-of-country supplies that would, if made in the United Kingdom, have been taxable. Those supplies were dealt with under reg 32.<br>
	LORD SLYNN OF HADLEY, LORD COOKE OF THORNDON, LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD and LORD MILLETT agreed.
