        <hr>
        <p> A squatter who asserted possessory title had to establish an intention 
          to possess, not to own, the relevant land and to exclude the paper title 
          owner only so far as was reasonably possible; accordingly his willingness 
          to pay for occupation of the land, if asked to do so, was not inconsistent 
          with his being in possession in the meantime. <br>
          The House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by the defendants, 
          Caroline Graham, in her own capacity and with Charles Denton, as personal 
          representatives of the late Michael Graham, from the Court of Appeal 
          [2001] Ch 804, which had allowed an appeal by the claimants, J A Pye 
          (Oxford) Ltd and J A Pye (Oxford) Land Ltd, from the decision of Neuberger 
          J [20002] Ch 676, who had dismissed their claim, inter alia, for possession 
          to 25 hectares of agricultural land at Henwick, Thatcham, Berkshire 
          on the ground that the defendants had established possessory title to 
          the land for the purposes of s 15(1) of and Schedule 1, paras 1, 8(1) 
          to the 1980 Act.<br>
          In February 1983 the claimants in a written agreement permitted G to 
          occupy the land for grazing; when the agreement expired in December 
          he remained in occupation although required to vacate it. The claimants 
          refused requests to renew the agreement, indicating that they wanted 
          the land not to be grazed while they sought planning permission for 
          development. In August 1984 with the claimants' permission they took 
          a cut of hay for payment and thereafter, without permission, continued 
          to use the land for grazing and other agricultural uses. The land, which 
          adjoined their farmland, was at all times enclosed by hedges and was 
          only accessible, save on foot, via a padlocked gate to which only they 
          had the key. </p>
        <p> LORD BROWNE-WILKINSON said that for the purposes of the 1980 Act the 
          words &quot;possession&quot; and &quot;dispossession&quot; bore their 
          ordinary meaning so that &quot;possession&quot;, as in the law of trespass 
          or conversion, connoted a sufficient degree of occupation or physical 
          control coupled with an intention to possess and &quot;dispossession&quot; 
          occurred where the squatter assumed &quot;possession&quot; as so understood; 
          the old notions, predating 1833, that the squatter should be required 
          to oust or exclude the paper owner as well as all others or to act inconsistently 
          with his user or adversely towards him had no place in the 1980 Act 
          and the phrase &quot;adverse possession&quot; in para 8(1) was directed 
          not to the nature of the possession but to the capacity of the squatter. 
          To establish factual possession the squatter had to show absence of 
          the paper owner's consent, a single and exclusive possession and such 
          acts as demonstrated that in the circumstances he had dealt with the 
          land as an occupying owner might normally be expected to do and that 
          no other person had done so. The requisite intention was, not to own, 
          but to possess and on one's own behalf in one's own name to exclude 
          the world at large, including the paper owner, so far as was reasonably 
          possible. It was not therefore inconsistent for a squatter to be willing 
          , if asked, to pay the paper owner and to be in possession in the meantime. 
          On the claimants' concession that the 1998 Act did not have retrospective 
          effect, the principle of interpretation that legislation should be construed 
          consistently with the Convention did not apply since the language of 
          the 1980 Act was not ambiguous. On the evidence as a whole and the facts 
          found by the judge, G was in factual possession and from September 1984 
          onwards had used the land as his own in a way normally to be expected 
          of the owner; the claimants had done nothing on the land and were effectively 
          excluded from it throughout that period. G had accordingly manifestly 
          intended to assert possession, possessory title had been established 
          and the judge's order would be restored.<br>
          Lord Mackay agreed; Lord Bingham, Lord Hope and Lord Hutton delivered 
          concurring opinions.<br>
