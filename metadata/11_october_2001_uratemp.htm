<p><b>Uratemp Ventures Ltd v Collins</b></p>
<p><b>HL: Lord Irvine of Lairg LC, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, Lord Steyn, Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough and Lord Millett: 11 October 2001</b></p>



<hr>
<p>		A &quot;dwelling&quot; within the meaning of section 1(1) of the Housing Act 1988 connoted a place where a person lived, treating it as home; it might consist of a single room but there was no requirement of statute or case law that cooking facilities had to be available for premises to fall within that interpretation; whether premises did so qualify was to be judged at the time proceedings commenced, and would depend on all the individual circumstances. <br>
	The House of Lords so held, when allowing an appeal by the defendant, John Collins, from the majority of the Court of Appeal, The Times, 10 December, 1999 which reversed the decision of Judge Cotran, sitting at the West London County Court. He had dismissed a claim by the plaintiffs, Uratemp Ventures Ltd, for possession of Room 403, the Viscount Hotel, Prince of Wales Terrace, Kensington, and concluded that Mr Collins was a tenant of the room and as such was entitled to an assured tenancy under the 1988 Act.<br>
	The defendant occupied a single room as a long-term resident in a hotel. The room contained a bed, some furniture, a shower and a basin, but no cooking facilities. It also had a power point which the defendant used for his electrical equipment, such as a kettle and a warming plate to reheat ready-cooked food. Following his removal to another room in the hotel the plaintiffs took no further part in his appeal to the House of Lords.</p>
<p>	LORD MILLETT said that in both ordinary and literary usage, residential accommodation was &quot;a dwelling&quot; if it was the occupier's home: it was the place where he lived and to which he returned and which formed the centre of his existence. Just what use he made of it when living there depended on his mode of life. No doubt he would sleep and usually eat there. He would often prepare some of his meals there, but his home was not less his home because he did not cook there but preferred to eat out or bring in ready-cooked meals.	It had never been a legislative requirement that cooking facilities had to be available for premises to qualify as a dwelling. His Lordship referred to 19th century cases relating to the Parliamentary franchise and to 20th century cases relating to the Rent Acts, in which a single room might constitute a &quot;dwelling&quot; and the presence of cooking facilities had not been regarded as determinative. He referred to &quot;sharing&quot; cases from which the supposed requirement as to cooking facilities derived. He said that such cases had not decided that a kitchen was an essential part of a dwelling, so that premises which lacked cooking facilities were not a dwelling. What they decided was that the essential feature of a dwelling was that it contained living accommodation, and that every room which formed part of the tenant's living accommodation, including the kitchen if there was one, formed part of his dwelling. It was fallacious to reason that, because a kitchen was a living room and therefore part of a dwelling which possessed one, premises which did not were not a dwelling.  </p>
