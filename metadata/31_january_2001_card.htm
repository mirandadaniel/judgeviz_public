<p>The taxpayers' credit card protection scheme had as its essential purpose the securing of insurance cover for customers against financial loss arising out of loss or misuse of credit cards, and other benefits of the scheme were ancillary to that essential purpose; accordingly, the transactions were exempt from VAT as being &#145;insurance &#133; transactions.&quot;<br>
	The House of Lords so held, following a reference to the Court of Justice of the European Communities (Case C-349/96) [1999] 2 AC 601, in allowing an appeal by the taxpayers, Card Protection Plan Ltd, from the Court of Appeal (Balcombe and Butler-Sloss LJJ and Sir John Megaw) [1994] STC 199, who had dismissed their appeal from Popplewell J [1992] STC 797 and allowed a cross-appeal by the Customs and Excise Commissioners.<br>
	The commissioners had held that the taxpayers' transactions with customers were liable to VAT. The London VAT Tribunal (Judge Medd QC) had dismissed the taxpayers' appeal. Popplewell J had allowed the taxpayers' appeal and directed apportionment of the transactions.</p>
<p>	LORD SLYNN OF HADLEY said that the taxpayers' scheme provided customers with, inter alia, insurance cover against financial loss in the event of fraudulent use of credit cards and registration of cards. To cover customers' claims they arranged a policy of insurance with an insurance company covering the various benefits to which customers were entitled. The Court of Justice (para 22, p 626) had held that &#145;insurance &#133; transactions' in art13(B)(a) of Council Directive (77/388/EEC) (&#145;the Sixth Directive') was broad enough in principle to cover such an arrangement and (para 32, p 627) that it was for the national court to determine, in the light of criteria stated by it, whether the taxpayers' transactions with their customers were to be regarded for VAT purposes as comprising two independent supplies (an exempt insurance supply and a taxable card registration service), or whether one of those was the principal supply to which the other was ancillary so as to receive the same tax treatment. The court was to have regard to the essential features of the transaction, and what from en economic point of view was in reality a single service should not be artificially split. An overall view should be taken. The essential feature of the taxpayers' scheme &#151; perhaps why objectively people were likely to want to join it &#151;  was to obtain a provision of insurance cover against loss arising from the misuse of credit cards or other documents. Other benefits were ancillary or incidental to the main objective of financial protection against loss. For VAT purposes the transactions thus comprised a principal exempt supply and other supplies ancillary thereto and was thus to be treated as exempt.</p>
<p>	LORD JAUNCEY OF TULLICHETTLE, LORD NOLAN, LORD STEYN and LORD HOFFMANN agreed.</p>
