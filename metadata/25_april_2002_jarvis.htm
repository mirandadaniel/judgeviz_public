        <p>&quot;Deliberate concealment&quot; in s 32(1)(b) and (2) of the Limitation 
          Act 1980 did not include failure to disclose a breach of duty that the 
          actor was not aware of committing.<br>
          The House of Lords, overruling Brocklesby v Armitage &amp; Guest (Note) 
          [2002] 1 WLR 598, so held in allowing an appeal by the defendants, Robinson 
          Jarvis &amp; Rolf, from the Court of Appeal [2002] 1 WLR 581. The Court 
          of Appeal, holding themselves bound by the decision in the Brocklesby 
          case, had dismissed the defendants' appeal from Newman J, who had held 
          that an action against them by the claimant, Martin William Cave, was 
          not statute-barred.</p>
        <p> LORD SLYNN OF HADLEY agreed with Lord Scott of Foscote.<br>
          LORD MACKAY OF CLASHFERN and LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH agreed with 
          Lord Millett and Lord Scott of Foscote.<br>
        </p>
        <p>LORD MILLETT said that s 32 deprived a defendant of a limitation defence 
          in two situations: where he took active steps to conceal his own breach 
          of duty after he had become aware of it, and where he was guilty of 
          deliberate wrongdoing and concealed or failed to disclose it in circumstances 
          where it was unlikely to be discovered for some time. It did not do 
          so in a case of negligence if, being unaware of his failure to take 
          proper care, there had been nothing for him to disclose and neither 
          his original wrongdoing nor his failure to disclose it had been deliberate.<br>
        </p>
        <p>LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE said that the claimant had instructed the defendants 
          to act for him in connection with a transaction securing him mooring 
          rights for 100 years over a company's land. The transaction had been 
          completed in March 1989. In February 1994 the company's receivers had 
          told him that the rights were no longer exercisable. Letters by him 
          to the defendants in 1995 and 1996 had been unanswered. On 16 January 
          1998 he had issued a writ against them for damages for negligence, complaining 
          that the document drafted or approved by one C on behalf of the defendants 
          had granted him merely contractual rights instead of rights enforceable 
          against the company and its successors and that C had failed to protect 
          the rights by registration. The defendants pleaded that the action was 
          time-barred. In reply, the claimant alleged that the defendants' failure 
          to answer his letters had constituted &quot;deliberate concealment&quot; 
          within s 32(1)(b) of the 1980 Act and that their negligent drafting 
          had been a deliberate commission of a breach of duty within s 32(2). 
          It had been held in the Brocklesby case that s 32(2) came into play 
          whenever there was an intentional act that constituted a breach of duty, 
          whether or not to the knowledge of the actor. That was not correct. 
          A breach of duty that the actor was not aware he was committing was 
          excluded.</p>
