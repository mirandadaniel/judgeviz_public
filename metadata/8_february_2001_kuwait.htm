<p>A party seeking a variation of an order of the House of Lords on the grounds that it had been made in reliance on perjured evidence should commence a fresh action at which the new evidence relied upon could be fully tested.<br>
	The House of Lords so held in giving reasons for refusing a petition by Kuwait Airways Corporation (KAC) for an order that the decision of the House given on 24 July 1995 [1999] 1 WLR 1147, in proceedings brought by KAC against Iraq Airways Corporation (IAC) and the Republic of Iraq, be varied.</p>
	LORD SLYNN OF HADLEY said it was alleged that a finding in the House's earlier decision was not only wrong but based on false and perjured evidence given with the intention of deceiving the court. KAC submitted that the House had an inherent jurisdiction to vary its order:  what was sought was not a review of the relevant legal principles but a review of their application on the basis of perjured evidence. On the material produced to the House it seemed that the issues raised by KAC were prima facie relevant, serious and substantial.  They could not be brushed aside as being insignificant. Whether in the end KAC was right, if KAC wished to raise those matters it should be able to do so. The question, however, was whether those issues should be raised in a petition before the House.  Their Lordships decided that they should not and so notified the parties at the end of the oral arguments. His Lordship arrived at that decision for two reasons. In the first place there was well established authority that where a final decision had been made by a court a challenge to the decision on the basis that it had been obtained by fraud had to be  made by a fresh action alleging and proving the fraud: see Flower v Lloyd (1877) 6 Ch D 297, Cole v Langford [1898]  2 QB 36, Jonesco v Beard [1930]  AC 298 and De Lasala v De Lasala [1980]  AC 546. The second reason was that even if there was a discretion to review the previous decision of the House the instant case would not be a suitable or convenient case in which to do so. The facts were complex.  It would be necessary to investigate the evidence both written and oral provided in 1991 and 1992 and the new evidence which it was said was obtained later.  It would also involve a question as to whether KAC knew of what it now said was the actual position at a much earlier stage and whether it had waived any right to object.  It might well be that there would be agreement as to some of the facts alleged but the question whether fraud was established would require a detailed and perhaps lengthy examination.  It was not appropriate for five of their Lordships to undertake such an inquiry nor would it be convenient for the House to refer the matter to one member or three members for an investigation and report.  The most convenient and appropriate course was for KAC, if it chose to raise those matters, to do so in a separate action.  For those reasons the petition was refused. 	<br>
	LORD GOFF OF CHIEVELEY, LORD JAUNCEY OF TULLICHETTLE and LORD NICHOLLS OF BIRKENHEAD agreed.
