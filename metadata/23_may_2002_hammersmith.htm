        <p><b>R v Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council and another, Ex 
          p Burkett and another</b></p>
        <p><b>HL: Lord Slynn of Hadley, Lord Steyn, Lord Hope of Craighead, Lord 
          Millett and Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers: 23 May 2002</b></p>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Grounds for applying for judicial review of a planning permission first 
          arose, under RSC Ord 53, r 4(1), on the grant of permission rather than 
          on the resolution to grant it. <br>
          The House of Lords so held in allowing an appeal by Sonia Maria Burkett 
          from the Court of Appeal (Sedley, Ward and Jonathan Parker LJJ) which 
          had on 13 December 2000 dismissed a renewed application by her and her 
          late husband for permission to apply for judicial review of a grant 
          by the local planning authority to the interested party, St George West 
          London Ltd, of an outline planning permission. Richards J had refused 
          their application on the ground of delay.</p>
        <p> LORD SLYNN OF HADLEY delivered an opinion agreeing with Lord Steyn 
          in allowing the appeal. <br>
          LORD STEYN said that a renewed application to the Court of Appeal under 
          RSC Ord 59, r 14(3) for permission to apply for judicial review was 
          a true appeal: see Kemper Reinsurance Co v Minister of Finance [2000] 
          1 AC 1. Where the Court of Appeal had granted leave to appeal and heard 
          the appeal, the House of Lords had jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal 
          against the Court of Appeal's refusal of permission. Lord Diplock's 
          extempore observation in In re Poh [1983] 1 WLR 2, 3 was not correct. 
          As to whether, under Ord 53, r 4(1) (now CPR r 54.5(1)), grounds for 
          the application, in respect of a grant of planning permission, first 
          arose at the date of the resolution or at the date of the actual grant 
          of permission, a readily ascertainable starting date was desirable. 
          Legal policy favoured simplicity and certainty, which the judgments 
          of the Court of Appeal and of Laws J in R v Secretary of State for Trade 
          and Industry, Ex p Greenpeace Ltd [1998] EnvLR 415 did not produce. 
          The better interpretation was that time only ran from the grant of permission. <br>
          LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD delivered an opinion agreeing with Lord Steyn 
          in allowing the appeal. <br>
          LORD MILLETT and LORD PHILLIPS OF WORTH MATRAVERS agreed with Lord Slynn 
          and Lord Steyn. <br>
