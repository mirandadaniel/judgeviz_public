<p>The six-month limitation period for bringing proceedings in s 2(4) of the 1970 Act was not incompatible with Community law, but the two-year periods in s 2(5) and reg 12(1)(b) of the 1976 Regulations was.<br>
	The House of Lords so held in applying rulings by the European Court of Justice (Case C-78/98) [2000] ICR 961 in response to questions referred to it [1998] 1 WLR 280 and varying accordingly, on appeals by the applicants, Mrs Shirley Anne Elizabeth Preston and 12 others in the first appeal and Mrs Dorothy Mary Elizabeth Fletcher and eight others in the second appeal, the order of the Court of Appeal [1997] ICR 899. The Court of Appeal had dismissed the applicants' appeals from the Employment Appeal Tribunal [1996] IRLR 484, which had dismissed their appeals from an industrial tribunal.<br>
	The applicants, mostly women, were, or had been, part-time workers and claimed to have been unlawfully excluded from various occupational pension schemes. The industrial tribunal had held that their claims were out of time under s 2(4) of the 1970 Act unless brought during employment or within six months of its termination and that under s 2(5) they would be entitled to only two years' backdated membership of the schemes with effect from the commencement of proceedings.</p>
<p>	LORD SLYNN OF HADLEY said that the Court of Justice had ruled that in the absence of Community rules it was for the domestic legal system of each member state to determine the procedural conditions governing actions to protect Community law rights; those conditions must not, however, make the enforcement of those rights impossible in practice or be less favourable than those applying to similar domestic claims. The six-month period in s 2(4) of the 1970 Act did not make the exercise of Community law rights impossible or excessively difficult. The two-year rule in s 2(5) and reg 12(1)(b) of the 1976 Regulations did do so and was therefore incompatible with Community law and precluded by it. Future pension benefits were to be calculated by reference to full- and part-time periods of service subsequent to 8 April 1976. As to whether the six-month period in s 2(4) was less favourable than for similar domestic actions, the question arose of a similar domestic action to take as comparator. That depended on whether the purpose, cause of action and essential characteristics were similar. An action for breach of the 1970 Act was not similar to a claim for breach of art 119. A claim in contract might, however, in his Lordship's view, provide a sufficiently similar comparison. Where there was a continuing contractual obligation, the contractual limitation period of six years did not begin to run only from the termination of the employment: there were successive breaches and the period ran from each complete cause of action in respect of each separate breach. The rules of procedure for a claim under s 2(4) were not, in all the circumstances, less favourable than those applicable to a claim in contract. Where contracts of service had been concluded at regular intervals within a stable employment relationship the six-month period would run from the end of the last contract within that relationship. In default of agreement the question of which applicants had had such a relationship must be referred back to the tribunal.<br>
	<br>
	LORD GOFF OF CHIEVELEY and LORD NOLAN agreed with Lord Clyde; LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD agreed with LORD SLYNN OF HADLEY; LORD CLYDE delivered an opinion agreeing with LORD SLYNN OF HADLEY.
