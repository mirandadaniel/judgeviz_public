<p><b>R v Independent Television Commission, Ex p TVDanmark 1 Ltd [2001] UKHL 42</b></p>
<p><b>HL: Lord Slynn of Hadley, Lord Nolan, Lord Hoffmann, Lord Hutton and Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough: 25 July 2001</b></p>
<hr>
<p> The rights of the public in one member state to watch a sporting or other event which had been designated as being of major importance for society should not be affected by whether the broadcaster was in that or another member state.<br>
	The House of Lords so held in allowing an appeal by the Independent Television Commission (ITC) from the order of the Court of Appeal (Kennedy, Waller and Jonathan Parker LJJ) [2001] 1 WLR 74 allowing an appeal by a UK broadcaster, TVDanmark 1 Ltd (TVD), from the dismissal by a deputy judge of the Queen's Bench Division of its application for judicial review to quash the refusal of the ITC to give its consent to TVD to televise to Denmark five of its national team's designated football matches.<br>
	Art 3a(3) of Directive 89/552/EEC imposed a duty upon every member state to ensure that its own broadcasters did not exercise exclusive rights to televise an event designated by another member state as being of major importance for society in such a way that a substantial proportion of that other member state's public was deprived of the possibility of watching. In implementation of art 3a, s 101B of the Broadcasting Act 1996 required UK broadcasters to obtain the consent of the ITC to exercise rights for the exclusive broadcasting of events designated by another member state. S 104 of the Act required the ITC to publish and have regard to a code setting out the criteria it would use.<br>
	Since TVD was only available to 60% of the Danish public, it required consent from the ITC. Despite finding that it complied with the relevant requirements of its code, in particular that all interested broadcasters had been given a genuine opportunity to acquire the rights on fair and reasonable terms at the auction and that the price paid for the exclusive rights had been fair and reasonable, the ITC had refused consent because it also had regard to the Danish provisions, which imposed an additional requirement that a successful non-qualifying broadcaster should offer to share the rights with qualifying broadcasters at a reasonable price, and TVD had refused to negotiate any such agreement.</p>
<p>LORD HOFFMANN said that the ITC had to take account of the other member state's system of regulation so as to give effect to the system of reciprocal enforcement created by art 3a requiring that regulation should as far as possible be harmonised so that the rights of the public to watch an event of national importance in a member state should not be affected by whether the broadcaster was situated in that or another member state. The ITC had made a proper exercise of discretion under s 101B.<br>
	LORD SLYNN OF HADLEY, LORD NOLAN, LORD HUTTON and LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH agreed.</p>
