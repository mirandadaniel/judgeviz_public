        <p><b>Ashworth Hospital Authority v MGN Ltd</b></p>
        <p><b>HL: Lord Slynn of Hadley, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Woolf, Lord 
          Nolan and Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough: 27 June 2002</b></p>
        <hr>
        <p> An order against the defendants for disclosure of the source of information 
          originating in the claimant authority's medical records and used in 
          a newspaper article had been rightly made.<br>
          The House of Lords so held in dismissing an appeal by the defendants, 
          MGN Ltd, from the order of the Court of Appeal (Lord Phillips of Worth 
          Matravers MR, May and Laws LJJ) [2001] 1 WLR 515 affirming Rougier J. <br> </br>
          LORD SLYNN OF HADLEY delivered an opinion agreeing with Lord Woolf.<br>
          LORD BROWNE-WILKINSON agreed with Lord Woolf and Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough.<br>
          LORD WOOLF said that an article in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; had 
          included verbatim extracts from the medical records of Ian Brady, one 
          of the Moors murderers, a patient at Ashworth Security Hospital. The 
          claimant authority, responsible for the management of the hospital, 
          wished to discover the source of the leak of information, probably an 
          employee at the hospital, and the judge had ordered the defendants to 
          make and serve a witness statement to that end. Under the Norwich Pharmacal 
          jurisdiction to order disclosure (Norwich Pharmacal Co v Customs and 
          Excise Comrs [1974] AC 133) there was no requirement that the person 
          against whom the proceedings were brought should himself be a wrongdoer: 
          it was sufficient that he was involved in or participated in the wrongdoing 
          of the person whose identity it was sought to establish. An order could 
          be made although the information was required not for the purpose of 
          bringing proceedings against the informant but with a view to his dismissal. 
          The situation had to be exceptional to justify an order for disclosure 
          of a journalist's sources, but disclosure of patients' records increased 
          the difficulty and danger involved in care of patients at the authority's 
          hospital and it was essential, to deter the same or similar wrongdoing 
          in the future, that the source should be identified and punished. The 
          fact that the patient himself had put similar material into the public 
          domain did not detract from the need to prevent staff from revealing 
          patients' medical records.<br>
          LORD NOLAN agreed with Lord Woolf and Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough.<br>
          LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH delivered an opinion agreeing with Lord 
          Woolf.<br>
