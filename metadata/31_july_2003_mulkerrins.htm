      <!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
      a bankruptcy court ruled that a trustee in bankruptcy had no interest in 
      a right of action in negligence which the bankrupt intended to bring, that 
      decision could not be challenged by the defendants to the action in an application 
      to strike out. <br>
      The House of Lords so held, allowing an appeal by the claimant, Barbara 
      Anne Mulkerrins, from a decision of the Court of Appeal [2001] BPIR 106 
      allowing an appeal by the defendants, PricewaterhouseCoopers (formerly trading 
      as Coopers &amp; Lybrand), from a decision of Jules Sher QC sitting as a 
      deputy judge of the High Court ([2000] BPIR 506), who had dismissed the 
      defendants' application to strike out the claimant's action against the 
      defendants brought following a declaration, granted by District Judge Henson 
      in the Reading County Court sitting in bankruptcy on 3 February 1999, that 
      the claimant's trustee in bankruptcy had no interest in the action.</font> 
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LORD MILLETT, agreeing 
        with Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, said that the claimant sought damages 
        from her former professional advisers, the defendants, for having negligently 
        failed to protect her from bankruptcy. It did not matter whether the district 
        judge's decision was right or wrong. Res judicata was a form of estoppel 
        which gave effect to the policy of the law that parties to a judicial 
        decision should not afterwards be allowed to re-litigate the same question, 
        even though the decision might be wrong. If it was wrong, it must be challenged 
        by appeal or not at all. The district judge's order therefore, bound the 
        trustee and through him the creditors. As between the claimant and the 
        creditors, her claim against the defendants and its proceeds belonged 
        to her and did not form part of the bankrupt estate available to them. 
        The defendants were not parties to the proceedings in the county court. 
        They were not given notice of and took no part in them. They were not 
        therefore bound by the district judge's order. But that did not mean that 
        they could simply ignore it or that they were unaffected by it. It meant 
        only that they could not be prejudiced by it. They could not re-litigate 
        the issue, not because it was res judicata as against them, but because 
        they had no legitimate interest in doing so. It would have been inappropriate 
        to allow the defendants to take any part in the proceedings in the county 
        court. Those proceedings were brought to resolve a dispute between the 
        claimant on the one hand and her creditors, represented by the trustee 
        on the other. The defendants were debtors with an adverse interest to 
        the claimant and her estate. They could not be prejudiced by the vesting 
        of the claim in her trustee; and a fortiori they could not be prejudiced 
        if it remained in her. They had no legitimate interest in the question 
        to be decided.<br>
        LORD WALKER OF GESTINGTHORPE agreeing, said that since the defendants 
        had no right to be heard, it was irrelevant that it was not bound by the 
        district judge's order in such a way as to create an estoppel per rem 
        judicatam. Since the trustee in bankruptcy who was the only other possible 
        contender for title to the right of action was bound by the order, its 
        practical effect was not open to challenge by the defendants.<br>
        <br>
        LORD BINGHAM OF CORNHILL and LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE agreed with LORD MILLETT 
        and LORD WALKER. LORD NICHOLLS OF BIRKENHEAD agreed with LORD WALKER.</font></p>
