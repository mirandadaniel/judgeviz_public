      <!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
      defendant seeking to prove a defence of diminished responsibility under 
      s 2(1) of the Homicide Act 1957 in a case where he had taken drink prior 
      to killing the victim, did not have to show that if he had not taken drink 
      he would still have killed as in fact he did. He was entitled to the defence 
      if the jury was satisfied that, despite the disinhibiting effect of the 
      drink on the defendant's mind, his mental responsibility for his fatal acts 
      was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from a cause 
      specified in s 2(1).<br>
      The House of Lords so ruled in the appeal of the defendant, Anthony Dietschmann, 
      from the dismissal by the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) ( Rose LJ, 
      Bell and Stanley Burnton JJ) on 5 October 2001, of his appeal from his conviction 
      for murder before Maurice Kay J and a jury at Liverpool Crown Court on 7 
      April 2000.<br>
      The case was remitted to the Court of Appeal to decide whether to allow 
      the appeal and quash the conviction for murder and order a new trial or 
      to substitute a verdict of guilty of manslaughter for the verdict of murder 
      found by the jury and to pass an appropriate sentence for that offence.</font> 
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LORD HUTTON said 
        that the defendant killed Nicholas Davies by punching him and kicking 
        him in the head in a savage attack. At the time of the killing the defendant 
        was heavily intoxicated and was also suffering from a mental abnormality 
        . The judge, in summing up, told the jury that the defendant was entitled 
        to the defence of diminished responsibility only if they were satisfied 
        on the balance of probabilities that, (1) if the defendant had not taken 
        drink he would still have killed and (2) he would have been under diminished 
        responsibility when he did so. His Lordship said that s 2(1) meant that 
        if the defendant satisfied the jury that, notwithstanding the alcohol 
        he had consumed and its effect on him, his abnormality of mind substantially 
        impaired his mental responsibility for his acts in doing the killing, 
        the jury should find him not guilty of murder but, under s 2(3), guilty 
        of manslaughter. That was because in referring to substantial impairment 
        of mental responsibility s 2(1) did not require the abnormality of mind 
        to be the sole cause of the defendant's acts in doing the killing. Even 
        if the defendant would not have killed if he had not taken the drink, 
        the causative effect of the drink did not necessarily prevent an abnormality 
        of mind suffered by the defendant from substantially impairing his mental 
        responsibility for his fatal acts.<br>
