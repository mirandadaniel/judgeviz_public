<p>A general attitude of helpfulness was insufficient to found liability under s 33(1) of the Race Relations Act 1976; it was aid to another to do the unlawful act in question which had to be shown.<br>
	Where therefore a council was told by police officers that a forthcoming reception booked at its premises might be a gipsy wedding with a potential risk of disorder, its decision to impose additional booking conditions amounted to unlawful discrimination of racial grounds but the officers, who took no part in the council's decision, could not be shown to have aided it, within the meaning of s 33(1), to do that unlawful act.<br>
	The House of Lords so held when dismissing an appeal by the plaintiffs, Lisa Hallam and Deborah Smith, from the Court of Appeal [2000] 1 WLR 966 which concluded that the officers did not have sufficient knowledge to found liability under s 33(1) and dismissed the plaintiffs' appeal from Judge Rutherford, sitting at Bristol County Court with assessors, who had rejected their claim against the officers.</p>
	LORD BINGHAM OF CORNHILL said that the officers had supplied information to alert the council to what the officers considered a serious potential problem and their general relations with the council were, properly, friendly and co-operative. But, as the judge had rightly highlighted the important point was that it was aid to another to do the unlawful act in question which had to be shown, and that the plaintiffs had failed to do, because neither officer was a party to or had been involved in the making of the council's decision. There were plainly a number of different ways in which the council could have responded , several of which would have been lawful. The judge's decision was open to him on the evidence and there were no grounds for disturbing it.<br>
	  LORD BROWN-WILKINSON, LORD STEYN, LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD agreed and LORD MILLETT delivered a concurring opinion.
