        <p><b>HL: (Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Hobhouse 
          of Woodborough, Lord Millett and Lord Scott of Foscote): 18 April 2002<br>
          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b> <font color="#FF0000">Now

        <hr>
        <p> When equipment which was the subject-matter of proceedings or as to 
          which a question arose in proceedings was sold pursuant to an interim 
          order of the court, the proceeds of sale took the place of the equipment 
          for the purposes of the litigation. The rights of the parties remained 
          unaffected and the court was entitled to make an order in relation to 
          the proceeds of sale so as to give effect to those rights.<br>
          The House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by the claimants, 
          On Demand Information plc and On Demand Information International plc, 
          from a decision dated July 31 2000 of the Court of Appeal ( Pill and 
          Robert Walker LJJ, Sir Murray Stuart-Smith dissenting) ( [2001] 1 WLR 
          155) upholding the dismissal by Mr George Laurence QC sitting as a deputy 
          judge of the Chancery Division ([1999] 2 All ER 811) on March 5 1999 
          of the claimants' application for relief from forfeiture of four finance 
          leases for video equipment granted to them by the defendants, Michael 
          Gerson (Finance) plc and Michael Gerson (Investments) Ltd. By the time 
          of the hearing before the judge the video equipment had been sold pursuant 
          to an interim order granted on the application of the claimants' administrative 
          receiver.</p>
        <p> LORD MILLETT said that the sole question was: what was the effect 
          of the sale on the lessee's claim for relief from forfeiture ? RSC Ord 
          29, r 4 did not give the court power to make a free-standing order for 
          sale as a form of independent relief. The property in question must 
          either form the subject-matter of the proceedings in which the order 
          was made or be property as to which a question arose in those proceedings. 
          The purpose of the court in exercising the power to order a sale was 
          to avoid the injustice that would otherwise result by the property becoming 
          worthless or significantly reduced in value during the interval between 
          the application for sale and the determination of the proceedings or 
          question. Given the purpose of Ord 29, r 4, it was clear that the conversion 
          of the property into money effected by the sale was not intended to 
          prejudice the parties' rights. The whole purpose of the sale was to 
          preserve the value of their rights and particularly the rights of the 
          party which was eventually successful in the proceedings. But while the 
          proceeds of sale were merely a substitute for the property in question, 
          the sale inevitably affected the nature of the remedy which the court 
          could grant. The subject-matter of the proceedings and ultimately of 
          the court's order was no longer property but money. The fact that by 
          the time the case was heard the court could no longer give the lessee 
          the particular relief claimed in the writ did not mean that the claim 
          was bound to be dismissed. If (i) the lessee would have been entitled 
          to the relief claimed in the writ immediately before the sale and (ii) 
          the only reason the court could not grant that relief was that the equipment 
          had since been sold pursuant to an order of the court which was not 
          intended to affect the parties' rights, then it should give effect to 
          those rights by making whatever order in relation to the proceeds of 
          sale best reflected them. There was no real difficulty in formulating 
          an appropriate order in the present case.<br>
          LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH and LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE delivered concurring 
          opinions; LORD NICHOLLS OF BIRKENHEAD and LORD BROWNE-WILKINSON agreed.<br>
