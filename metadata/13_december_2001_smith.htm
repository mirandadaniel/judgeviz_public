          <br>
          HL: Lord Bingham of Cornhill, Lord Nolan, Lord Hoffmann, Lord Hutton 
          and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: 13 December 2001</b></p>



<hr>
        <p> The defendant had derived a pecuniary advantage within s 71 of the 
          Criminal Justice Act 1988 when he had passed customs posts at the mouth 
          of a river without paying excise duty on a cargo of cigarettes even 
          though he had been stopped up river by customs officers and the cigarettes 
          had been seized and forfeited.<br>
          <br>
          The House of Lords so held in allowing an appeal by the Crown from the 
          Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) (Mance LJ, Newman and Burton JJ), 
          which on 16 June 2000 had allowed an appeal by the defendant, David 
          Cadman Smith, against a confiscation order made by Judge Moore at Sheffield 
          Crown Court. <br>
          <br>
          LORD BINGHAM OF CORNHILL, LORD NOLAN, LORD HOFFMANN and LORD HUTTON 
          agreed with Lord Rodger of Earlsferry. <br>
          <br>
          LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY said that he agreed with Laws LJ in R v Dimsey 
          and Allen [2000] 1 Cr App R(S) 497 when he had said, at p 500, that 
          the ordinary and natural meaning of "pecuniary advantage" included the 
          case where a debt was evaded or deferred. Thus the defendant had derived 
          a pecuniary advantage when he had evaded payment of the customs duty 
          at the customs posts at Immingham and Hull, and that remained the case 
          even though the cigarettes had been seized by the customs officers when 
          they had boarded the defendant's boat at Goole. Under s 71(4) of the 
          1968 Act the court was concerned simply with the value of the property 
          to the offender "when he obtained it" (s 74(5)(a)); it made no difference 
          if, after he had obtained it, it was destroyed or damaged or forfeited 
          by customs officers. The defendant had, accordingly, benefited from 
          the offence under s 71 and the order of the Crown Court should be restored.
