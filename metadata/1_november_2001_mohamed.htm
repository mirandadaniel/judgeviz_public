          <br>
          HL: Lord Lord Slynn of Hadley, Lord Steyn, Lord Hoffmann, Lord Hutton 
          and Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough: 1 November 2001 </b></p>



<hr>
        <p> On a statutory review of a local housing authority's decision to refer 
          an application for accommodation to another authority under s 198 of 
          the Housing Act 1996 on the basis that the applicant had no local connection 
          with itself but had such a connection with that other authority, any 
          occupation by the applicant of interim accommodation within the first 
          authority's district prior to the date of the review could constitute 
          normal residence for the purpose of s 199(1)(a) of the Act and so be 
          taken into account as evidence of a local connection. <br>
          <br>
          The House of Lords so held in dismissing an appeal by Hammersmith and 
          Fulham London Borough Council against the decision of the Court of Appeal 
          (Henry and Potter LJJ) [2001] QB 97 (1) allowing an appeal by the applicant, 
          Abdulrahman Mohamed, against the decision of the county court judge 
          to confirm a reviewing officer's decision that the applicant had no 
          local connection with Hammersmith; and (2) ordering a fresh review in 
          which the applicant's occupation of interim accommodation within its 
          district was taken into account.<br>
          <br>
          The applicant and his wife had arrived in Hammersmith and sought housing 
          assistance. They were placed in interim accommodation within the borough 
          pending a decision. The authority's decision was that although it had 
          a duty to arrange accommodation for them, it would transfer their application 
          to another authority under s 198 on the ground that they had no local 
          connection with Hammersmith but the wife had a local connection with 
          that other authority. The applicant had sought a review of the decision 
          under s 202 of the Act, but the reviewing officer, having disregarded 
          the period spent in interim accommodation, had affirmed the decision. 
          <br>
          <br>
          LORD SYLNN OF HADLEY said that the authority's principle argument was 
          that the occupation of interim accommodation pending a decision on an 
          application under the Act could not be "normal residence" for the purposes 
          of s 199(1)(a). However, the prima facie meaning of normal residence 
          was a place where at the relevant time the person in fact resided. So 
          long as that place where he ate and slept was voluntarily accepted by 
          him, the reason why he was there rather than somewhere else did not 
          prevent that place from being his normal residence. Interim accommodation 
          could therefore be taken into account in deciding whether a local connection 
          existed. The correct date to decide whether a person had a local connection 
          was not the date of the making of the application but the date of the 
          decision or, if there was a review, the date of the review. As to the 
          material which might be looked at on the review, the reviewing officer 
          could have regard not only to the facts known to the original decision 
          maker but to information relevant to the period before the first decision 
          but only obtained thereafter and to matters occurring after the initial 
          decision.<br>
          <br>
          LORD STEYN, LORD HOFFMANN, LORD HUTTON and LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH 
          agreed. </p>
