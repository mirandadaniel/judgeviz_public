        <p><b>R v Pope</b></p>
        <p><b>HL: Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Hobhouse 
          of Woodborough, Lord Millett and Lord Scott of Foscote: 20 June 2002</b></p>
        <hr>
        <p> S 42 of the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973 was clear and unambiguous 
          and it gave the Crown Court power to deal with an offender who had been 
          convicted in the magistrates' court and committed for sentence to the 
          Crown Court as if he had just been convicted on indictment in the Crown 
          Court. Subsequent legislative amendments did not create any lacuna in 
          the law so as to restrict the Crown Court's powers to make confiscation 
          orders pursuant to s 71 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 in respect 
          of offenders who had been committed for sentence by the magistrates' 
          court and whose offences had been committed before 30 September 1998.<br>
          The House of Lords so held allowing an appeal by the Crown appeal from 
          a decision of the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) on 5 April 2001, 
          allowing an appeal by the defendant, Alan Pope, against a confiscation 
          order in the sum of &pound;127,000 imposed by the Crown Court at Peterborough 
          (Judge Morell sitting with justices) on 26 May 2000 on the defendant's 
          committal for sentence pursuant to s 38 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 
          1980 after he pleaded guilty at Huntingdon Magistrates' Court on 20 
          January 2000 to 17 offences, committed between 1993 and 1997, of procuring 
          the execution of a valuable security by deception contrary to s 20(2) 
          of the Theft Act 1968 .</p>
        <p>LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH said that the Court of Appeal had concluded 
          that they were bound by R v Whellem [2000] 1 Cr App R (S) 200 to hold 
          that the Crown Court had no jurisdiction to make the confiscation order. 
          The question of statutory construction had arisen from the manner in 
          which the 1988 Act and other relevant Acts had been amended from time 
          to time. Having referred to the course of the amending legislation and 
          to the parties' submissions his Lordship said that s 42 was clear and 
          so was the function of the s 38 scheme of which it formed part. The 
          purpose was to enable the question of guilt in a case triable either 
          way to be settled in the magistrates' court where the defendant did 
          not opt for trial on indictment and for the Crown Court to deal with 
          sentence where it was necessary to ensure that the sentencing court 
          had the appropriate sentencing powers to reflect the gravity of the 
          case. S 42 used wholly appropriate words to achieve that result. The 
          supposed lacuna in the powers of the Crown Court to make confiscation 
          orders did not exist even for the short period between the introduction 
          of the new subsection (1E) to s 71 by the Proceeds of Crime Act in 1995 
          and the introduction, by the Crime and Disorder Act, of subsection (9A) 
          to s 71 which came into force on30 September 1998. R v Whellem was overruled. 
          <br>
          Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Millett and 
          Lord Scott of Foscote agreed.</p>
