<p><b>McGrath v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and another</b></p>

<p>Where police in Northern Ireland arrested a person named in a lawfully-issued Scottish warrant as required to be arrested (for failure to answer bail to re-appear in a Scottish court), but the person was in fact the innocent victim of another's deceit (that other having stated when arrested that his name was that of the innocent person), the police were not liable for false arrest.  <br>
	The House of Lords so held in allowing an appeal by the defendants, the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Chief Constable of the Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary, from the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland [2000] NI 56 which had allowed an appeal by the plaintiff, Terence Joseph McGrath, from the order of McDermott LJ, sitting in the High Court of Justice in Northern Ireland, who had dismissed his claim for damages against the defendants for false arrest.<br>
	In 1991 a person named Macken was arrested in Scotland.  When charged in the sheriff court with the theft of a motor vehicle, he falsely used the name of the plaintiff, whom he had known in Belfast, and when he failed to appear at court for sentencing a warrant was issued for his arrest in that name.  The Royal Ulster Constabulary duly arrested the plaintiff, relying on  s 38(3) of the Criminal Law Act 1977 which provided that &quot;a warrant issued in England, Wales or Scotland for the arrest of a person charged with an offence may be executed in Northern Ireland ...&quot;, and he was held until it was discovered that he was not the person who had appeared before the sheriff court.</p>
<p>	LORD CLYDE said that the warrant had been lawfully and validly issued under the law of Scotland.  That it might be possible to strike it down on the ground of the mistake of fact in the identity of the person named in the order of the court did not render it a nullity.  It remained valid until it was recalled or cancelled.  The only question was whether its execution had been in conformity with s 38(3). The Court of Appeal held that s 38(3) required that the person named in the warrant was a person who had actually been charged with an offence. But it was also possible that the words were simply describing the kind of warrant with which the subsection was concerned, namely a warrant to arrest, as distinct from a warrant to search or any other kind of warrant. On that approach the words were not detailing the substance of the warrant so as to require that the person arrested had in fact been charged with an offence.  The latter construction was to be preferred.  In any event, the plaintiff had been, albeit mistakenly, charged with an offence.  If the plaintiff was without a remedy that was not because the law deprived him of any right to a remedy but because the circumstances of the person who caused the mistake to be made by his own deliberate deception might be such that the remedy was not worth pursuing.<br>
	LORD BROWNE-WILKINSON agreed.  LORD HUTTON delivered a concurring opinion and LORD STEYN and LORD COOKE OF THORNDON agreed with LORD CLYDE and LORD HUTTON.</p>
