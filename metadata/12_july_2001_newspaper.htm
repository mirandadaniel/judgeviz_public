<p>For the purposes of copyright in the typographical arrangement of a newspaper, the &quot;published edition&quot;, within the meaning of s 8(1) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, was the whole newspaper. When considering whether there had been a breach of such copyright, a facsimile copy of an article from a newspaper which gave no indication of the layout of the rest of the page did not constitute a &quot;substantial part&quot; of the published edition within the meaning of s 16(3) of the Act.<br>
	The House of Lords so held in dismissing an appeal by the plaintiff, The Newspaper Licensing Agency Ltd, from a decision of the Court of Appeal (Peter Gibson and Mance LJJ; Chadwick LJ dissenting) [2001] Ch 257 allowing an appeal by the defendant, Marks and Spencer plc, from a decision of Lightman J [1999] RPC 536 by which he decided that the defendant was infringing the plaintiff's typographical copyright. </p>
<p>	LORD HOFFMANN said that a &quot;published edition&quot; was defined by s 8 as &quot;a published edition of the whole or any part of one or more literary dramatic or musical works&quot;.  The words &quot;or more&quot; showed that one might have a single published edition of more than one literary work. That definition showed that there was no necessary correlation between the concept of a literary, dramatic or musical work and the concept of a published edition.  The frame of reference for the term &quot;published edition&quot; was the language of the publishing trade. The edition was the product, generally between covers, which the publisher offered to the public. On the issue of &quot;substantial part&quot; within the meaning of s 16(3)(a), the House had decided in Ladbroke (Football) Ltd v William Hill (Football) Ltd [1964]  1 WLR 273 that the question of substantiality was a matter of quality rather than quantity. One had to ask whether there had been copying of sufficient of the relevant skill and labour to constitute a substantial part of the edition's typographical arrangement. In the case of a modern newspaper, the skill and labour devoted to typographical arrangement was principally expressed in the overall design.  It was not the choice of a particular typeface, the precise number or width of the columns, the breadth of margins and the relationship of headlines and straplines to the other text, the number of articles on a page and the distribution of photographs and advertisements but the combination of all of those into pages which gave the newspaper as a whole its distinctive appearance.  In some cases that appearance would depend upon the relationship between the pages. Usually, however, it would depend upon the appearance of any given page.  But it was difficult to think of the skill and labour which had gone into the typographical arrangement of a newspaper being expressed in anything less than a full page. The particular fonts, columns, margins and so forth were only, so to speak, the typographical vocabulary in which the arrangement was expressed. The House had been shown specimens of the press cuttings of which complaint had been made.  None of them sufficiently reproduced the layout of any page to amount to a substantial part of its typographical arrangement.</p>
<p>	LORD NICHOLLS OF BIRKENHEAD, LORD MACKAY OF CLASHFERN, LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD and LORD MILLETT agreed.</p>
