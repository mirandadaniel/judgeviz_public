      to the Status of Refugees (1951) (Cmd 9171) and (1967) (Cmnd 3906).<br>
      The House of Lords so held in dismissing an appeal by the applicants, Yasin 
      Sepet and Erdem Bulbul, from a decision of the Court of Appeal (Waller, 
      Laws and Jonathan Parker LJJ) of 11 May 2001 dismissing their appeals from 
      a decision of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal (Collins J and P R Moulden) 
      dated 18 May 2000 which dismissed their appeals from separate decisions 
      of the special adjudicator (J R L G Varcoe CMG) against the refusal by the 
      Secretary of State for the Home Department to grant them asylum as refugees. 
      </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> LORD BINGHAM OF CORNHILL 
        said that there was compelling support for the view that refugee status 
        should be accorded to one who had refused to undertake compulsory military 
        service on the grounds that such service would or might require him to 
        commit atrocities or participate in a conflict condemned by the international 
        community, or where his refusal would earn grossly excessive or disproportionate 
        punishment. But the applicants could not, on the facts as found, bring 
        themselves within any of those categories. Nor had they been found to 
        have a rooted objection to all military service, or an objection based 
        on religious belief. Their unwillingness was based on strong and sincere 
        opposition to the Turkish Government's policy towards their own Kurdish 
        community. Their fear of the treatment which they would receive if returned 
        to Turkey and maintained their refusal was, without doubt, well-founded. 
        The crucial question was whether that treatment was to be regarded, for 
        Convention purposes, as persecution for one or more Convention reasons. 
        The core of their argument was that there existed a fundamental, internationally 
        recognised, right, to refuse to undertake military service on grounds 
        of conscience. The leading international human rights instruments, literally 
        interpreted, gave little assistance to that argument. However, the reach 
        of an international human rights Convention was not forever determined 
        by the intentions of those who originally framed it. Thus the House was 
        appropriately asked to consider a mass of material illustrating the movement 
        of international opinion since the major relevant Conventions were adopted. 
        From that it was plain that several respected human rights bodies had 
        recommended and urged member states to recognise a right of conscientious 
        objection to compulsory military service, to provide a non-combatant alternative 
        and to consider the grant of asylum to genuine conscientious objectors. 
        But such resolutions and recommendations could not themselves establish 
        a legal rule binding in international law. It was hard for the applicants 
        to show that there was clear international recognition of the right for 
        which they contended, at any rate as of now. That temporal limitation 
        was important, since international opinion was dynamic and the House could 
        not do more than give effect to what it understood to be the current position. 
        The applicants' contention did not find compelling support in the decided 
        cases. The problem was that the treaties had treated compulsory military 
        service as an exception from the forced labour prohibition without making 
        any other provision, and there was not, as yet, a new consensus.<br>
        It had additionally been argued that, in deciding whether an asylum applicant 
        had been or would be persecuted for Convention reasons, examination of 
        the circumstances should be approached from the perspective of the persecutor, 
        since that was the determinative perspective in inciting the persecution. 
        Dyson LJ's statement in Sivakumar v Secretary of State for the Home Department 
        ([2002] INLR 310, 317, para 23) that &quot;It is necessary for the person 
        who is considering the claim for asylum to assess carefully the real reason 
        for the persecution&quot; seemed to be a clear, simple and workmanlike 
        test which gave effect to the 1951 Convention, provided that it was understood 
        that the reason was the reason which operated in the mind of the persecutor 
        and not that which the victim believed to be the reason for the persecution, 
        and that there might be more than one real reason.<br>
