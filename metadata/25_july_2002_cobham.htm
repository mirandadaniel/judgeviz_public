          Lord Hutton and Lord Millett: 25 July 2002</b><br>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p> Local social service authorities were not allowed to charge for after-care 
          services provided pursuant to s 117 of the Mental Health Act 1983 to 
          persons in their area who had been discharged from compulsory detention 
          under s 3 of that Act.<br>
          The House of Lords so held in dismissing appeals by Manchester City 
          Council, Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council and Harrow London Borough 
          Council from the order of the Court of Appeal (Otton and Buxton LJJ 
          and Hooper J) sub nom R v Richmond upon Thames London Borough Council, 
          Ex p Watson [2001] QB 370 affirming the decision of Sullivan J [2000] 
          LGR 318 to allow judicial review applications by four discharged patients 
          to quash the decision of their authority to charge for accommodation 
          provided under s 117. The fourth discharged patient, who had brought 
          proceedings against Richmond upon Thames London Borough Council, died 
          before the appeal to the House.<br>
          By s 117(2): &quot;...It shall be the duty of the ...local social services 
          authority to provide after-care services for any person [specified in 
          s 117(1), including those discharged from a s 3 detention] until ... 
          satisfied that the person concerned is no longer in need of such services 
          ...&quot;<br>
          <br>
          LORD STEYN said that the three cases before the House all involved mentally 
          ill persons who were formally admitted to hospital under s 3, discharged, 
          and placed in caring residential accommodation by their authority pursuant 
          to s 117 but charged for that accommodation. The central question was 
          whether s 117 authorised and required the provision of the after-care 
          services, in which case there was no right to charge because s 117 contained 
          no charging provision, or whether it merely operated as a gateway section 
          to trigger provisions under other statutory provisions, the relevant 
          one in respect of residential accommodation being s 21 of the National 
          Assistance Act 1948, which contained an express charging provision. 
          His Lordship said that if Parliament had intended by s 117(2) that after-care 
          services would be provided under other statutory provisions, one would 
          have expected s 117(2) to specify the statutory provisions to be triggered. 
          Such a gateway provision would require appropriate wording, as in s 
          2 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970. Instead s 117 
          was free-standing and itself imposed a duty on the authorities to provide 
          the after-care services. It was incapable of being read as a duty to 
          secure the provision of such services under unnamed other enactments. 
          Counsel for the authorities had accepted in oral argument that there 
          was a duty under s 117 to provide after-care services but had disputed 
          that there was any power under the section to provide the services. 
          However, the natural and obvious interpretation of s 117(2) was that 
          the duty by necessary implication imported a concomitant power to carry 
          out the duty.<br>
          LORD SLYNN, LORD MACKAY, LORD HUTTON and LORD MILLETT agreed.<br>
