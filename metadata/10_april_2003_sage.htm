      The exception in s 55(2)(a) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to 
      &quot;development&quot; for which planning permission was required applied 
      only to a completed building on which work was being carried out for its 
      maintenance, improvement or other alteration and not to the work involved 
      in completing an incomplete structure which was subject to planning control. 
      <br>
      Therefore, even if the work remaining to be done on an incomplete dwelling 
      house was only internal work which did not affect the external appearance 
      of the building, the outstanding work was still subject to planning permission 
      and the building could not be regarded as &quot;substantially completed&quot; 
      for the purposes of s 171B(1). <br>
      The House of Lords so held, allowing Maidstone Borough Council's appeal 
      from the dismissal by the Court of Appeal ( Schiemann, Keene LJJ and Sir 
      Murray Stuart-Smith) on 28 June 2001 of their appeal from a decision of 
      Mr Duncan Ousley QC sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge on 11 October 2000. 
      The judge had allowed an appeal by Alan Frank Sage from the decision, dated 
      December 16 1999, of an inspector appointed by the Secretary of State for 
      the Environment, Transport and the Regions, upholding an enforcement notice 
      served on 19 March1999 requiring Mr Sage to demolish a partially erected 
      dwelling house on the ground that it was constructed in breach of planning 
      control. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH said that the appeal concerned the construction 
        of s 171B(1) of the 1990 Act and the starting point of the four-year period 
        within which an enforcement notice had to be served: namely, &quot;the 
        date on which the operations were substantially completed&quot;. Mr Sage 
        challenged the notice on the ground that it was out of time since no work 
        had been carried out on the structure in the four years before the notice 
        was served. The inspector concluded that the building was a dwelling house 
        &quot;in course of construction&quot;. Mr Sage submitted that since all 
        the work remaining to be done was either internal work or work which did 
        not materially affect the external appearance of the building it came 
        within the exception to &quot;development&quot; in s 55(2)(a) of the Act 
        and therefore did not require planning permission. He argued that the 
        enforcement notice could only relate to breaches of planning control and 
        once no further breach was involved in completing the development there 
        could be no further building operations to which an enforcement notice 
        could apply and therefore the operations referred to in s 171B(1) must 
        have been completed. <br>
        His Lordship said that the exception in s 55(2)(a) applied only to work 
        carried out for the &quot;maintenance, improvement or other alteration&quot; 
        of a completed building and not to work carried out by way of completing 
        an incomplete structure. The work required to complete the incomplete 
        dwelling house did not come within the exception and required planning 
        consent. If a building operation was not carried out, both externally 
        and internally, fully in accordance with the planning permission granted, 
        the whole operation was unlawful. The notice had not been served outside 
        the period of four years starting from the date on which the building 
        operations were substantially completed.<br>
        <br>
        LORD NICHOLLS OF BIRKENHEAD and LORD RODGER OF EARLSFERRY agreed.<br>
        <br>
        LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD and LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE delivered concurring 
        speeches. </font><br>
