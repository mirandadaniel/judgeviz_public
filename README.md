This is the repository for judgeViz, a website which provides a new and innovative way to interact with UKHL judgments. <br/>
This project is submitted as part of the requirements for the MSc Computer Science (conversion) at the University of Bristol. <br/>
It is preferable that you create and use a Python virtual environment to run judgeViz. <br/>

In order to run judgeViz: <br/>
* Please create a new database called 'all_data' in MySQL and upload the data in 'all_data_export2.sql'
* Please use Python version 3.10.4, and ensure that you have installed Pandas, pydot, NumPy, Flask, SQLAlchemy and WTForms
* You will have to change the relative path files to match your local file paths </br>

Please contact np18979@bristol.ac.uk if you have any questions <br/>
Thank you for your interested in judgeViz!
