<!-- It is preferable that you create and use a Python virtual environment to run judgeViz. <br/> -->

If you are interested in demo'ing judgeViz, please contact me at np18979@alumni.bristol.ac.uk. Unfortunately, I am unable to publish the dataset used to power judgeViz, as this data is not public available. Therefore, you will not be able to run the code from this repository. 

<!-- In order to run judgeViz: <br/>
* Please create a new database called 'all_data' in MySQL and upload the data in 'all_data_export2.sql'
* Please use Python version 3.10.4, and ensure that you have installed Pandas, pydot, NumPy, Flask, SQLAlchemy and WTForms
* You will have to change the relative path files to match your local file paths </br> -->

Please contact np18979@bristol.ac.uk if you have any questions <br/>
Thank you for your interested in judgeViz!
