 <p> A taxpayer could not be required by a notice under s 20(1) of the 
          Taxes Management Act 1970 to deliver documents attracting legal professional 
          privilege (&quot;LPP&quot;).<br>
          The House of Lords so held in allowing an appeal by the taxpayer, Morgan 
          Grenfell &amp; Co Ltd, from the Court of Appeal which had dismissed 
          the taxpayer's appeal from the Divisional Court of the Queen's Bench 
          Division ([2002] 2 WLR 255, DC and CA).<br>
          The Divisional Court had dismissed the taxpayer's application for judicial 
          review of a notice under s 20(1) of the 1970 Act and decisions of a 
          special commissioner consenting under s 20(7) to the issue of the notice 
          and determining preliminary issues.</p>
        <p> LORD NICHOLLS OF BIRKENHEAD agreed with Lord Hoffmann.<br>
          LORD HOFFMANN said that in connection with the issue of the tax payable 
          by the taxpayer pursuant to a tax avoidance scheme devised by it the 
          inspector, wishing to see documents relating to the advice that the 
          taxpayer had obtained from leading counsel and solicitors about whether 
          the scheme would work, had issued a notice under s 20(1) demanding delivery, 
          and the taxpayer had objected that the documents were subject to LPP. 
          LPP was a fundamental human right not to be overridden except expressly 
          or by necessary implication. S 20(1) did not do so expressly, and there 
          was no necessary implication to be drawn from the context of the Act 
          as a whole, including the express references to LPP in ss 20B(8) and 
          20C(3) relied on by the revenue. The notice should accordingly be quashed.<br>
          LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD agreed with Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hobhouse of 
          Woodborough.<br>
          LORD HOBHOUSE OF WOODBOROUGH delivered an opinion agreeing with Lord 
          Hoffmann.<br>
          LORD SCOTT OF FOSCOTE agreed with Lord Hoffmann.<br>
