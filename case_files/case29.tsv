2.45	29	44	41	8	bingham	In considering the intention of Parliament when passing the 1985 Act , or perhaps more properly the intention of the draftsman in settling its terms , there are three ( but only three ) hypotheses to be considered : ( 1 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because it was regarded as clear that the 1938 Act would continue to operate , in cases to which it applied , irrespective of the terms of Part V ; ( 2 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because it was not in the mind of the draftsman of Part V ; ( 3 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because Part V was not seen to encroach upon or conflict with the operation of section 5 .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	1	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	46	42	9	bingham	I would reject the first hypothesis for two reasons .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	47	43	9	bingham	First , it is the practice of parliamentary draftsmen to show an abundance of caution and to favour the avoidance of doubt .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	48	44	9	bingham	Secondly , had the draftsman conceived that a secure tenant 's right to buy could be subject to a condition of ministerial consent under section 5 that right would not have been defined in section 118 in the terms quoted in paragraph 7 above , and provision would have been made for asserting and admitting or denying , and handling , claims to exercise the right to buy where ministerial consent was required .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	0	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	49	45	9	bingham	If I concluded ( as I do not ) that section 5 was intended to operate in cases covered by Part V , I would agree with Buxton LJ that the Part V procedures could be made to work , but the absence of any indication that the procedures were devised to apply to conditional rights fortifies the inference that section 5 was not intended to operate in cases covered by Part V .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	0	0	0	0	1
2.45	29	49	46	9	bingham	Had it been so intended , the draftsman would have imposed a duty on a local authority to refer to the Secretary of State a claim to exercise the right to buy made by a tenant whose case fell within section 5 .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	0	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	51	47	10	bingham	I would also reject the second hypothesis .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	52	48	10	bingham	The Housing Act 1985 was one of three major enactments in which , pursuant to recommendations of the Law Commission ( as stated in The Report on the Consolidation of the Housing Acts , Report No144 ( Cmnd 9515 ) , 2 May 1985 , p 3 ) , it was sought to consolidate for England and Wales the whole of the Housing Acts save for provisions relating to the subject-matter of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 and the Rent Act 1977 .

2.45	29	54	50	10	bingham	It seems to me unlikely ( although no doubt possible ) that in the course of this massive consolidation exercise the 1938 Act was simply overlooked , the more so since the draftsman of the Housing Act 1988 had it in mind ( see paragraph 3 above ) .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	1	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	56	51	11	bingham	I would accept the third hypothesis .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	57	52	11	bingham	Reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because an involuntary disposal of housing accommodation by a local authority which would not in itself undermine the beneficial environmental objectives of the 1938 Act was not understood to engage the operation of section 5 .	DISPOSAL	1	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	1	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	58	53	11	bingham	This understanding justified the terms used in section 118 , which would otherwise have been misleading , and is consistent with the absence in Part V of any recognition that a tenant 's exercise of the right to buy might be dependent on obtaining ministerial consent .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	0	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	59	54	11	bingham	Parliament rightly regarded the Part V regime as falling out-with the scope of section 5 : there was no conflict or inconsistency between the two regimes , and hence there was no need to refer to section 5 .	DISPOSAL	1	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	0	0	0	0	0

2.45	29	63	57	12	bingham	Since the London Borough of Croydon has not chosen to rely on that provision , and the relevant facts have not been investigated , the possible application of that paragraph must remain speculative .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	64	58	12	bingham	Should the council seek to rely on this paragraph hereafter , the tenant would have strong grounds for contending that the point could and should have been raised at a much earlier stage .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0

2.45	29	467	401	81	rodger	Presumably , this objection related to paragraph 5 ( 1 ) ( b ) of schedule 5 to the 1985 Act .	FACT	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	1	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	468	402	81	rodger	On 6 June 1997 , however , Croydon wrote to the respondent indicating that on reconsideration of the evidence they no longer adhered to that objection and that a further notice would be issued under section 124 , admitting her right to buy .

2.45	29	469	403	81	rodger	That was duly done and the second section 124 notice now regulates the position .	FACT	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	0	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	470	404	81	rodger	Understandably , counsel for the parties to the appeal could cast no light on precisely why Croydon had eventually concluded that the respondent 's case fell outside the scope of paragraph 5 .	PROCEEDINGS	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	471	405	81	rodger	But it is plain that Croydon considered at length various factual and legal matters and reached a view , from which they have not sought to depart in these proceedings even though they were joined as a party .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	472	406	81	rodger	The House must proceed on the basis of that view .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	474	407	82	rodger	Nevertheless , the fact that the respondent 's case has at least some of the characteristics of one where no right to buy would arise under paragraph 5 of Schedule 5 makes it somewhat different from the run-of-the-mill case of a secure tenant acquiring his council house .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	0	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	475	408	82	rodger	More particularly , the fact that the flat is situated in a small complex of buildings near to where the public have access gave some scope for Croydon to argue at the public inquiry that the security and convenient running of the park and neighbouring premises might be adversely affected if the flat passed from their ownership and control .

2.45	29	476	409	82	rodger	"These and similar considerations appear to lie at the heart of the inspector 's recommendation , which the Secretary of State accepted , that consent to the "" sale "" should be refused ."	FACT	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	479	410	83	rodger	My Lords , it would not be appropriate , in a case where the House has decided that section 5 of the 1938 Act does not apply , to seek to define precisely which issues the Secretary of State may take into account when deciding whether to grant or refuse consent under that section .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	1	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	480	411	83	rodger	None the less , it is important to remember that Parliament 's aim in enacting the 1938 Act was essentially to maintain open space around London .	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	1	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	481	412	83	rodger	"It did so , in terms of the long title , by making provision "" for the preservation from industrial or building development of areas of land in and around the administrative county of London "" ."	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	1	0	0	0

2.45	29	483	414	83	rodger	There were , of course , necessary exceptions to this prohibition , but it went a long way towards achieving Parliament 's aim of keeping the landscape open .	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	484	415	83	rodger	That landscape would be made up , for the most part , of private land to which the public would have no right of access , but in which they could still take delight when walking or cycling or on a motor or charabanc excursion from the city .

2.45	29	485	416	83	rodger	Other sections , such as section 22 , envisaged a system of covenants restricting the use of particular areas of land , while section 27 set out various purposes , such as recreation , camping and agriculture , for which Green Belt land could be used without infringing the Act .	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	0	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	486	417	83	rodger	In essence , therefore , the 1938 Act was concerned to establish both public and private Green Belt land around London and to prevent industrial or building development on it .	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	1	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	487	418	83	rodger	By contrast , the Act was not concerned with prescribing what should actually be done with the land .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0

2.45	29	493	424	83.5	rodger	So far as relevant , the restrictions on the user of Green Belt land have applied to the stables and flat from the time of Croydon 's declaration in 1948 and continue to do so .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
2.45	29	494	425	83.5	rodger	More particularly , if Croydon grant a long lease to the respondent under section 138 ( 1 ) of the 1985 Act , the flat will continue to be Green Belt land and the relevant restrictions will continue to apply to it .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	1	0	0	0	0

2.45	29	499	430	83.5	rodger	Approaching the matter in that way , rather than from the narrower angle of the somewhat special facts of this case , I consider that there would have been no reason for Parliament to stipulate that a secure tenant 's right to buy should arise only where the Secretary of State gave his consent under the 1938 Act , since the change from public to private ownership under the 1985 Act does not in principle impair the effectiveness of the Green Belt .
