1.19	22	161	157	30	hoffmann	On its face , this provision does no more than deem certain activities to be the carrying on of a business when they might not otherwise be so regarded .	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.19	22	162	158	30	hoffmann	It enables a taxable supply made by a taxable person , which otherwise might have been thought to fall outside section 4 ( 1 ) because it was not in the course or furtherance of a business , to be brought within it .	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	0	0	0	0	0
1.19	22	163	159	30	hoffmann	It therefore obviously assumes that the provision of facilities by a club etc to its members can amount to a taxable supply by a taxable person .	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0

1.19	22	167	162	31	hoffmann	But this turns out to be linked with the second question about whether the Association is making taxable supplies to its members , because a taxable person is defined as a person who is , or is required to be , registered for VAT ( section 3 ( 1 ) ) and a person is required to be registered ( subject to a minimum turnover requirement and other immaterial qualifications ) if he is making taxable supplies : see Schedule 1 .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	0	0	0	0	0

1.19	22	169	164	31	hoffmann	If so , it is a taxable person .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.19	22	170	165	31	hoffmann	In fact , the question may be even narrower , because Mr Smouha ( who appeared for the Association ) said that unless the facilities provided by the persons employed on behalf of the members of the Association were a taxable supply to its members , the consideration for the other facilities would be insufficient to bring the Association within the registration requirement .	PROCEEDINGS	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.19	22	171	166	31	hoffmann	So the question is whether the Association is making a taxable supply by providing its members with the services of its employees or the right to avail themselves of those services .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.19	22	174	167	32	hoffmann	My Lords , an unincorporated association is , as I have said , not a legal entity .	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0

1.19	22	182	174	33	hoffmann	I think that there are two .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.19	22	183	175	33	hoffmann	First , it is necessary that there should be something which can be described as an association .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.19	22	184	176	33	hoffmann	Secondly , the facility or service in question must be provided in accordance with the rules of the association and must be in consideration of a payment into the funds of the association .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.19	22	186	177	34	hoffmann	The first condition is the existence of an association rather than simply a contractual arrangement for jointly obtaining goods and services and sharing their expense .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.19	22	187	178	34	hoffmann	Durham Aged Mineworkers ' Homes Association v Customs and Excise Commissioners [ 1994 ] STC 553 , much relied upon by Mr Smouha , illustrates an arrangement in the second category .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	1	0
1.19	22	188	179	34	hoffmann	An association cannot be defined by the enumeration of a set of necessary and sufficient conditions .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.19	22	189	180	34	hoffmann	What can be done is to list features which are normally present in an association .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.19	22	190	181	34	hoffmann	So , for example , it will usually have a set of rules which constitute a mutually binding contract between the members , a statement of its objects and provisions for its governance by a committee or committees , the admission of members and the cessation of membership ( giving the association a continuity beyond its original members ) and provisions ( or a rule-making power ) for the terms and conditions upon which members may enjoy the benefits of membership .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.19	22	191	182	34	hoffmann	This list of the paradigm characteristics of an association is not intended to be exhaustive .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.19	22	192	183	34	hoffmann	Furthermore , it is perfectly possible for contractual arrangements to lack one or more of these features and still be regarded as constituting an association .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.19	22	193	184	34	hoffmann	But the further the arrangements depart from those of the standard case , the less likely they are to be treated as an association for the purposes of the Act .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.19	22	195	185	35	hoffmann	The second condition is to exclude arrangements which are not with members as such but involve the association acting simply as an ordinary third party .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.19	22	196	186	35	hoffmann	For example , if two members of a club ask the wine steward to buy them a case of wine as part of the club 's next order , undertaking to reimburse the cost , there is no supply to the members by the club .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0

1.19	22	203	192	36	hoffmann	There is an association and the right of any member to the services provided by the employees engaged for the purposes of the association is governed by the rules or by-laws made under the rules .	DISPOSAL	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0

1.19	22	206	194	37	hoffmann	Mr Smouha said that what made the difference in the present case was the terms upon which the employees had been engaged and certain features of the constitution .	PROCEEDINGS	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
