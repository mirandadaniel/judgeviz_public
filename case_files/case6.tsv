1.43	6	35	26	8	bingham	In these cases some space or facility was ( or was said to be ) enjoyed in common between the tenant and another or others , and the question was whether that which was enjoyed in common was of such a character or of such significance as to preclude description of what was let as a separate dwelling .	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.43	6	36	27	8	bingham	In this context , distinctions were understandably and rightly drawn between living rooms , such as bedrooms and kitchens , and ancillary offices , such as bathrooms and lavatories : common enjoyment of the former but not the latter tended to weigh against recognition of the premises let as a separate dwelling .

1.43	6	41	31	9	bingham	So the short question is whether room 403 , the room let ( as it is assumed ) to Mr Collins , is a dwelling-house .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.43	6	43	32	10	bingham	Save that a dwelling-house may be a house or part of a house ( 1988 Act , section 45 ( 1 ) ) , no statutory guidance is given on the meaning of this now rather old-fashioned expression .	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	1	0	0	0	0

1.43	6	49	37	11	bingham	At that stage it is necessary to consider the terms of the letting , the premises let and , in my opinion , the use made of them by the tenant : see section 1 ( 1 ) ( b ) of the 1988 Act , which recognises that circumstances may change during the currency of a tenancy .

1.43	6	54	41	12	bingham	It is in my view plain on the evidence that this room was Mr Collins ' home , the place where he lived , and this is so whether he had his meals out or warmed up food to eat in his room or did a little rudimentary cooking or a bit of all three .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	1
1.43	6	55	42	12	bingham	If a room were so small and cramped as to be unable to accommodate a bed , I should be inclined to doubt whether it would qualify to be called a dwelling-house because , although sleeping in premises may not be enough to make them a dwelling-house , premises will not ordinarily be a dwelling-house unless the tenant sleeps there .

1.43	6	56	43	12	bingham	But in my view the courts should be very wary of laying down inflexible rules which come to be mistaken for rules of law even though they are very largely conclusions of fact based on particular cases .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
