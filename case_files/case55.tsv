3.22	55	14	9	3	hope	As my noble and learned friend has explained , Mr Sage 's primary argument at first instance was that the building was an agricultural building for which he did not need planning permission .	PROCEEDINGS	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	1
3.22	55	15	10	3	hope	This was a pure question of fact , and it was resolved against him conclusively by the inspector 's finding that the building was not an agricultural building but was best described as a dwelling house that was in the course of construction .	PROCEEDINGS	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.22	55	17	11	4	hope	This led to the alternative argument that the notice was out of time because the operations that must be substantially completed for the purpose of section 171B ( 1 ) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 comprise the operations which constituted a breach of planning control , or ( as it was put ) the operational development , and not the whole operation of completing the dwelling house .	PROCEEDINGS	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	1	0	0	0	0
3.22	55	18	12	4	hope	The inspector 's view was that the four year period did not begin until the whole operation of creating the dwelling house was substantially completed .	PROCEEDINGS	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.22	55	19	13	4	hope	He then held , treating the question as one of fact and degree , that the building in this case was not a substantially completed dwelling house .	PROCEEDINGS	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.22	55	20	14	4	hope	Here again the inspector 's decision on the facts went against Mr Sage and the contrary is not longer arguable .	PROCEEDINGS	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.22	55	21	15	4	hope	The question which remains is whether the inspector was right when he said that the four year period did not begin until the whole operation of creating the dwelling house was substantially completed .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.22	55	23	16	5	hope	"Mr Sage 's argument is that the reference in section 171B ( 1 ) to the date "" on which the operations are substantially completed "" has to be read in the light of the wording of the other relevant sections in the 1990 Act , and that by tracing the language of that subsection back through section 171A ( 1 ) ( a ) the reader is required to bring into account the definition of "" development "" in section 55 ( 1 ) of the Act , those operations which section 55 ( 2 ) ( a ) says are not to be taken to involve development and the definition of the word "" building "" in section 336 ( 1 ) ."

3.22	55	24	17	5	hope	If this approach is right the position is , as Keene LJ explained in paras 27 - 31 of his judgment , capable of being resolved quite simply by saying that what have to be substantially completed are those operations which amount to a breach of planning control and that operations and works which do not amount to development because they fall within section 55 ( 2 ) ( a ) are not to be taken into account .	PROCEEDINGS	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	0	0	0	0	1

3.22	55	28	20	6	hope	I was initially attracted to this approach , as it seemed to me to be consistent with the language of the statute and to be unlikely , as Keene LJ said in para 32 of the judgment , to give rise to practical difficulties .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	1
3.22	55	29	21	6	hope	But I have in the end been persuaded , with respect , that the language of the statute is open to a different interpretation and that it makes better sense of the legislation as a whole to adopt the holistic approach which my noble and learned friend has described .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.22	55	30	22	6	hope	What this means , in short , is that regard should be had to the totality of the operations which the person originally contemplated and intended to carry out .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0

3.22	55	35	26	7	hope	If it is shown that all the developer intended to do was to erect a folly , such as a building which looks from a distance like a complete building - a mock temple or a make-believe fort , for example - but was always meant to be incomplete , then one must take the building when he has finished with it as it stands .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0

3.22	55	37	28	7	hope	But if it is shown that he has stopped short of what he contemplated and intended when he began the development , the building as it stands can properly be treated as an uncompleted building against which the four year period has not yet begun to run .

3.22	55	42	32	8	hope	His conclusion was supported , in his view , by an application which Mr Sage had made in 1994 to use the building for tourist accommodation and by his finding that that remained Mr Sage 's stated intention .	FACT	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0

3.22	55	232	213	38	hobhouse	Just as change of use can change the appropriate classification of a completed building so , too , in my opinion , there can be no logical objection to the appropriate classification of a building in course of construction being changed by use , or by intentions for future use , of the uncompleted building inconsistent with its original classification .

3.22	55	233	214	38	hobhouse	As with a completed building , the change could be either a change from an uncompleted agricultural building to an uncompleted dwelling , or a change from an uncompleted dwelling to an agricultural barn , whether completed or uncompleted .

3.22	55	235	215	39	hobhouse	For example , under the Town and Country Planning General Development Order 1988 ( SI 1988/1813 ) planning permission is in general not necessary for the erection of a building which is reasonably necessary for the purposes of agriculture .

3.22	55	238	218	39	hobhouse	Conversely , I suggest , in a case where the construction of a building as an additional dwelling has been commenced by a farmer but before the building is complete he changes his mind , decides to use the uncompleted building for agricultural purposes and actually does commence and continue that use , the classification of the structure as an uncompleted dwelling would no longer be accurate .
