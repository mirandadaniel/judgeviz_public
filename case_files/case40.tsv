2.23	40	6	4	1	slynn	The facts and the issues are set out in the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord Steyn to which I gratefully refer .	TEXTUAL	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	1
2.23	40	8	5	2	slynn	In summary , a committee of the local planning authority decided on 15 September 1999 that planning permission should be granted for a large scale development in Fulham subject to certain conditions being fulfilled .	FACT	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0

2.23	40	10	7	2	slynn	On 12 May 2000 planning permission was actually granted .	FACT	2	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
2.23	40	12	8	3	slynn	"At that time Order 53 r 4 ( 1 ) of the Rules of the Supreme Court provided that an application for leave to apply for judicial review should be made "" promptly and in any event within three months from the date when grounds for the application first arose "" ."	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	0	1	0	0	0
2.23	40	13	9	3	slynn	If the relevant date was 15 September 1999 the application was clearly out of time .	PROCEEDINGS	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0

2.23	40	16	11	4	slynn	It is clear that if the challenge is to the resolution ( as it may be ) time runs from that date , but the question on the present appeal is whether , if the application is amended to challenge the grant of planning permission rather than the resolution , time runs from 15 September 1999 or 12 May 2000 .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
2.23	40	18	12	5	slynn	In my opinion , for the reasons given by Lord Steyn , where there is a challenge to the grant itself , time runs from the date of the grant and not from the date of the resolution .	DISPOSAL	4	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	1
2.23	40	19	13	5	slynn	It seems to me clear that because someone fails to challenge in time a resolution conditionally authorising the grant of planning permission , that failure does not prevent a challenge to the grant itself if brought in time , i e from the date when the planning permission is granted .

2.23	40	20	14	5	slynn	I realise that this may cause some difficulties in practice , both for local authorities and for developers , but for the grant not to be capable of challenge , because the resolution has not been challenged in time , seems to me wrongly to restrict the right of the citizen to protect his interests .

2.23	40	21	15	5	slynn	The relevant legislative provisions do not compel such a result nor do principles of administrative law prevent a challenge to the grant even if the grounds relied on are broadly the same as those which if brought in time would have been relied on to challenge the resolution .

2.23	40	446	419	61	hope	The explanation for the absence of a specific statutory time limit is to be found in the history of the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court of Session which preceded the introduction of a new procedure for judicial review by rule of ourt 260B of the Rules of the Court of Session 1965 ( SI 1965/321 ) .
