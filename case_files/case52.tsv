3.14	52	346	336	41.5	rodger	For instance , the law is concerned with whether state officials may persecute someone because he is Jewish , but the motives of those officials for any such persecution - whether a desire to give effect to the theories of racial purity in Hitler 's Mein Kampf or simple jealousy of the prosperity of the Jewish community - are irrelevant .

3.14	52	356	344	43	rodger	I have difficulty , however , in seeing why - in a case such as the present - the use of extreme torture should in itself be a factor pointing to the conclusion that the applicant was , or would be , ill-treated for a Convention reason rather than as part of the security forces ' anti-terrorist operations .
