3.08	62	5	3	1	bingham	I would dismiss this appeal for the reasons given by my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann , whose opinion I have had the advantage of reading in draft and whose summary of the facts and the relevant legislation I gratefully adopt and need not repeat .

3.08	62	7	4	2	bingham	Since the Trade Disputes Act 1906 , trade unions and their officials have enjoyed a measure of immunity from actions against them by employers based on the tort of inducing breaches of contract by employees .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	1	0	0	0	0

3.08	62	9	6	2	bingham	Under the law as it now stands , immunity is enjoyed only if the inducement is an act done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute ( Trade Union and Labour Relations ( Consolidation ) Act 1992 , section 219 ) and only if the breach induced has the support of a properly conducted ballot ( 1992 Act , sections 226 - 234 ) .

3.08	62	12	8	3	bingham	"The first issue turns on the definition of a trade dispute in section 244 ( 1 ) of the 1992 Act as meaning ( so far as relevant ) "" a dispute between workers and their employers which relates wholly or mainly to ...

3.08	62	13	9	3	bingham	It is plain that most disputes between employers and employees which lead to strike action or industrial action short of a strike fall squarely within this definition however it is construed .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0

3.08	62	15	11	3	bingham	In such situations , the employers or the employees ( or their representatives ) are seeking a change in some aspect of the employment relationship between them , whether strictly contractual or not , which the other party is resisting , and the action is taken to put pressure on the other party to accede .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.08	62	16	12	3	bingham	In such a case , if the ordinary processes of negotiation and collective bargaining break down , the inducement of breaches of contract ( save in excepted employments , and subject to the balloting requirements ) is not unlawful .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0

3.08	62	19	14	4	bingham	But Mr Giffin , for the appellant P , contended that the statutory definition of trade dispute covers nothing other than a dispute about terms and conditions of employment , giving that expression the broad meaning favoured by Lord Denning MR in British Broadcasting Corporation v Hearn [ 1977 ] 1 WLR 1004 at 1010 ; [ 1977 ] ICR 685 at 692 and approved by the House in Hadmor Productions Ltd v Hamilton [ 1983 ] 1 AC 191 at 227 , 233 - 234 .

3.08	62	20	15	4	bingham	I was for a time attracted by this argument , which was skilfully deployed and appeared to reflect the language of the statute .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.08	62	21	16	4	bingham	But I am persuaded that such a construction would be too narrow and would deny protection to genuine , employment-related disputes between employers and employees which have in the past been thought to be protected and ought in fairness to be so .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.08	62	22	17	4	bingham	Suppose , for example , an employer introduced a new machine or a new working schedule , as the employer was in principle entitled to do , but which his employees resisted on the ground that the machine was potentially dangerous or the new working schedule too onerous .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.08	62	23	18	4	bingham	There could be no doubt of the employer 's duty to take reasonable care not to expose his employees to danger or to excessive stress , and it would accordingly be artificial to regard such a dispute as one about the terms and conditions of their employment , even on a broad construction of that expression .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.08	62	24	19	4	bingham	It would in truth be a dispute about the job the employees were required to do , a matter going to the very heart of the employment relationship .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.08	62	25	20	4	bingham	I would accordingly read the statutory definition as covering a genuine dispute between employees and their employer relating wholly or mainly to the job the employees are employed to do or the terms and conditions on which they are employed to do it .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.08	62	26	21	4	bingham	If this test is applied to the facts of the present case , as summarised by my noble and learned friend , it is plain that the dispute between the teaching staff and the governing body as their employers related directly to the job the teachers were required to do and were unwilling to do , which was to teach P. .	DISPOSAL	1	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.08	62	27	22	5	bingham	The crux of the second issue , relating to the ballot , is whether the ballot was invalidated ( and the trade union 's entitlement to immunity thereby lost ) because the union failed to treat two of its members at the school , of whose existence it learned after ballot papers had been sent out but before the conclusion of the balloting process , as persons entitled to vote .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.08	62	28	23	5	bingham	At first blush , one would expect the union 's unintentional failure , which did not affect the result of the ballot , to be exonerated under section 232B .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	0	0	0	0	0
3.08	62	29	24	5	bingham	But section 232A is not one of the provisions listed in section 232B ( 2 ) , which refers only to sections 227 ( 1 ) , 230 ( 2 ) and 230 ( 2A ) , with the result that a breach of section 232A cannot be excused under section 232B .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	0	0	0	0	0
3.08	62	31	25	6	bingham	It has been common ground between the parties throughout that the reference to section 230 ( 2A ) in section 232B makes no sense .	PROCEEDINGS	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	0	0	0	0	0
3.08	62	32	26	6	bingham	Morison J inferred , reasonably enough , that the reference to section 230 ( 2A ) in section 232B was intended to be a reference to section 232A , since when spoken both sound the same ( judgment , paragraph 25 ) .	PROCEEDINGS	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	0	0	0	0	1
3.08	62	33	27	6	bingham	The Court of Appeal ( [ 2001 ] ICR 1241 ) saw the force of this point ( judgment of Waller LJ , paragraph 59 ) but invited further argument , as a result of which it became clear ( and was accepted by both sides ) that the reference in section 232B ( 2 ) should have been , not to section 230 ( 2A ) , but to section 230 ( 2B ) .	PROCEEDINGS	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	0	1	0	1	1
3.08	62	34	28	6	bingham	Thus the House has the unenviable task , as did the courts below , of attempting to construe this complicated series of provisions with knowledge that they contain at least one blatant error .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.08	62	36	29	7	bingham	In the present case , the number of union members at the school was relatively small and it would not have been unduly onerous for the union both to establish with accuracy who was entitled to vote and also to ensure they received ballot papers .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.08	62	37	30	7	bingham	But these statutory provisions would apply equally to industrial action to be undertaken by thousands or tens of thousands .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.08	62	38	31	7	bingham	It would be absurd if an immaterial and accidental failure to send a ballot paper to a single member were to invalidate the ballot , so as to deprive the union of immunity , and this contingency is provided for by sections 230 ( 2 ) and 232B .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.08	62	39	32	7	bingham	But it would be equally absurd if an immaterial and accidental failure to establish with accuracy who was entitled to vote were to invalidate the ballot so as to deprive the union of immunity .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.08	62	40	33	7	bingham	It is inconceivable that Parliament intended these 1999 amendments to the 1992 Act to have that result .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	1	0	0	0	0
3.08	62	41	34	7	bingham	The House must attempt to give the provisions a likely and workable construction .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.08	62	42	35	7	bingham	In my opinion , the construction advanced by my noble and learned friend achieves that result , and I also would adopt it .	DISPOSAL	13	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
