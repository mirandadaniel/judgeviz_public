2.47	24	50	46	9	bingham	Instead , Mr Fitzgerald based his argument on the one striking feature common to both their cases : that in each of them the trial judge had concluded that the appellant was not at all likely on release to present any danger to the public .

2.47	24	65	60	12	bingham	First , convicted murderers serving the tariff term of their mandatory life sentences cannot know whether they will be released at the end of it or not , and so ( unlike prisoners serving determinate sentences ) will spend years on end uncertain about their date of release .

2.47	24	69	64	12	bingham	But in the cases of those not judged to be dangerous the safeguards serve no valid penological purpose ; they are arbitrary , excessive and disproportionate ; and so they offend articles 3 and 5 of the convention .	PROCEEDINGS	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	1	0	0	0	0

2.47	24	82	75	14	bingham	The fact that section 1 ( 1 ) represents the settled will of a democratic assembly is not a conclusive reason for upholding it , but a degree of deference is due to the judgment of a democratic assembly on how a particular social problem is best tackled : see Brown v Stott [ 2001 ] 2 WLR 817 at 834 - 835 , 842 ; R ( Mahmood ) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [ 2001 ] 1 WLR 840 at 854 - 855 , paragraph 33 , and 856 , paragraph 38 .

2.47	24	87	79	15	bingham	This in itself distinguishes this class of case from that to which section 2 of the 1997 Act applied , since it is clear that an offence may fall within the statutory definition of a serious offence and yet fall far short of serious crime , as was the case in R v Offen itself and as was the case in R v Buckland [ 2000 ] 1 WLR 1262 before it .
