1.35	5	9	6	2	bingham	Regulation 4 of the Social Security ( Persons from Abroad ) Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations 1996 ( SI 1996/30 ) introduced a new condition of eligibility for payment of the grant , relating not to an applicant 's medical need for assistance but to an applicant 's immigration status .	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	1	0	0	0	0
1.35	5	10	7	2	bingham	The introduction of this new condition plainly presented the draftsman with a question to be resolved : how was the new immigration condition to be applied to recipients currently in receipt of the benefit who did not meet the new condition ?	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.35	5	12	8	3	bingham	One answer would have been to provide that those in receipt of the benefit when the new condition came into effect should continue to be eligible to receive it , whether they met the new condition or not , so long as their medical need for assistance persisted .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.35	5	13	9	3	bingham	This solution would have had the humanitarian advantage that benefit would not be withdrawn from those who continued to need it on medical grounds and had received it in the past and might have come to depend on it .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.35	5	14	10	3	bingham	This is , in effect , the solution which the applicant says was adopted .	PROCEEDINGS	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.35	5	15	11	3	bingham	Another answer would have been to provide that existing recipients should continue to be eligible until the period ( whether fixed or indefinite ) of their current grants of benefit expired or they ceased to need the grant on medical grounds , whichever might be sooner .

1.35	5	111	90	20	lord	In the case of a review which resulted in the adjudication officer declining to make any change , the mere fact of the review would deprive someone in receipt of benefit of the protection of regulation 12 ( 3 ) and result in the withdrawal of benefit even though there was no change in his circumstances .
