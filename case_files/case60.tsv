3.44	60	125	114	20	hoffmann	In any case in which a tribunal has to apply a standard with a greater or lesser degree of imprecision and to take a number of factors into account , there are bound to be cases in which it will be impossible for a reviewing court to say that the tribunal must have erred in law in deciding the case either way : see George Mitchell ( Chesterhall ) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd [ 1983 ] 2 AC 803 , 815 - 816 .

3.44	60	141	128	23	hoffmann	Lord Reid was in my opinion making two very pertinent points .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	1
3.44	60	142	129	23	hoffmann	First , he was drawing attention to a feature of language ; namely , that many words or phrases are linguistically irreducible in the sense that any attempt to elucidate a sentence by replacing them with synonyms will change rather than explain its meaning .	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.44	60	143	130	23	hoffmann	Lord Kilbrandon made the same point in his reference to Dr Johnson at p. 867 .	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	1
3.44	60	144	131	23	hoffmann	On the other hand , Lord Reid insisted that , whether the statute used simple words or difficult ones , its construction was a question of law .	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	1
3.44	60	146	132	24	hoffmann	Lord Reid was here making the well-known distinction between the meaning of a word , which depends upon conventions known to the ordinary speaker of English or ascertainable from a dictionary , and the meaning which the author of an utterance appears to have intended to convey by using that word in a sentence .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	1
3.44	60	147	133	24	hoffmann	The latter depends not only upon the conventional meanings of the words used but also upon syntax , context and background .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.44	60	148	134	24	hoffmann	The meaning of an English word is not a question of law because it does not in itself have any legal significance .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.44	60	149	135	24	hoffmann	It is the meaning to be ascribed to the intention of the notional legislator in using that word which is a statement of law .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.44	60	150	136	24	hoffmann	It is because of the nature of language that , in trying to ascertain the legislator 's meaning , it is seldom helpful to make additions or substitutions in the actual language he has used .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.44	60	152	137	25	hoffmann	"Lord Reid 's second point is made in the last sentence of the passage I have quoted , when he says that the question of whether the facts found by the tribunal count as "" insulting "" for the purposes of the statute is a question of fact ."	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	1
3.44	60	153	138	25	hoffmann	There is a good deal of high authority for saying that the question of whether the facts as found or admitted fall one side or the other of some conceptual line drawn by the law is a question of fact : see , for example , Edwards v Bairstow [ 1956 ] AC 14 and O ' Kelly v Trusthouse Forte plc [ 1984 ] QB 90 .	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	1	1	0
3.44	60	154	139	25	hoffmann	What this means in practice is that an appellate court with jurisdiction to entertain appeals only on questions of law will not hear an appeal against such a decision unless it falls outside the bounds of reasonable judgment .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.44	60	156	140	26	hoffmann	It may seem rather odd to say that something is a question of fact when there is no dispute whatever over the facts and the question is whether they fall within some legal category .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.44	60	157	141	26	hoffmann	In his classic work on Trial by Jury Lord Devlin said ( at p 61 ) :	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	1
3.44	60	157	142	26.5	hoffmann	""" The questions of law which are for the judge fall into two categories : first , there are questions which cannot be correctly answered except by someone who is skilled in the law ; secondly , there are questions of fact which lawyers have decided that judges can answer better than juries . """	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.44	60	159	143	27	hoffmann	Likewise it may be said that there are two kinds of questions of fact : there are questions of fact ; and there are questions of law as to which lawyers have decided that it would be inexpedient for an appellate tribunal to have to form an independent judgment .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.44	60	160	144	27	hoffmann	But the usage is well established and causes no difficulty as long as it is understood that the degree to which an appellate court will be willing to substitute its own judgment for that of the tribunal will vary with the nature of the question : see In re Grayan Building Services Ltd [ 1995 ] Ch 241 , 254 - 255 .

3.44	60	162	145	28	hoffmann	"Applying the first of these two points to the facts of the present case , I think that it was unhelpful for the Court of Appeal to construe the statutory language as if it included words like "" daily "" or "" regularly "" ."	DISPOSAL	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	1	0	0	0
3.44	60	163	146	28	hoffmann	Applying the second , I think that the decision of the tribunal was within the bounds of reasonable judgment .	DISPOSAL	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.44	60	164	147	28	hoffmann	"I therefore think that , properly understood , Lord Reid 's remarks in Brutus v Cozens [ 1973 ] AC 854 , 861 do not lay down some heterodox principle which provides a short cut to dismissing an appeal ( "" the last resort of counsel appearing on behalf of respondents "" as Lord Woolf MR said in R v Radio Authority , Ex p Bull [ 1998 ] QB 294 , 304 ) but are in accordance with established principles and common sense ."
