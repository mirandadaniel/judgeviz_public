3.1	57	313	308	40	hutton	In his submissions on behalf of the Crown Mr Perry submitted that it was the policy of the criminal law that self-induced intoxication did not constitute a defence to a criminal charge , and that if the appellant 's submissions were correct an intoxicated disinhibited killer would be excused .

3.1	57	315	310	40	hutton	The policy of the criminal law inrespectof persons suffering from mental abnormality is to be found in the words of section 2 , and the section provides that if a person suffers from such abnormality of mind as substantially impairs his mental responsibility , he should not be convicted of murder but of manslaughter .

3.1	57	316	311	40	hutton	As my noble and learned friend , Lord Rodger of Earlsferry , observed in the course of Mr Perry 's submissions , a brain-damaged person who is intoxicated and who commits a killing is not in the same position as a person who is intoxicated , but not brain-damaged , and who commits a killing .

3.1	57	319	313	41	hutton	As regards the second part of the question , without attempting to lay down a precise form of words as the judge 's directions are bound to depend to some extent on the facts of the case before him , I consider that the jury should be directed along the following lines :	DISPOSAL	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.1	57	319	314	41.5	hutton	""" Assuming that the defence have established that the defendant was suffering from mental abnormality as described in section 2 , the important question is : did that abnormality substantially impair his mental responsibility for his acts in doing the killing ?"

3.1	57	320	315	41.5	hutton	You know that before he carried out the killing the defendant had had a lot to drink .	DISPOSAL	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.1	57	321	316	41.5	hutton	Drink cannot be taken into account as something which contributed to his mental abnormality and to any impairment of mental responsibility arising from that abnormality .	DISPOSAL	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.1	57	322	317	41.5	hutton	But you may take the view that both the defendant 's mental abnormality and drink played a part in impairing his mental responsibility for the killing and that he might not have killed if he had not taken drink .	DISPOSAL	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.1	57	323	318	41.5	hutton	If you take that view , then the question for you to decide is this : has the defendant satisfied you that , despite the drink , his mental abnormality substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his fatal acts , or has he failed to satisfy you of that ?	DISPOSAL	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.1	57	324	319	41.5	hutton	If he has satisfied you of that , you will find him not guilty of murder but you may find him guilty of manslaughter .	DISPOSAL	8	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0

3.1	57	327	321	42	hutton	The recent death of Professor Sir John Smith is a great loss to the world of legal scholarship , especially in the field of criminal law , and in suggesting the direction set out above I am fortified by the consideration that it would be in general conformity with the direction suggested by him as an alternative approach to the problem in his commentary on the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the present case [ 2002 ] Crim LR 132 , 136 :	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	1	0	1	1
