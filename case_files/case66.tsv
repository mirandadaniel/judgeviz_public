3.32	66	5	3	1	bingham	I am in complete agreement with the opinion of my noble and learned friend Lord Hoffmann , and I gratefully adopt his account of the facts and issues in this appeal .	DISPOSAL	13	hoffmann	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	1
3.32	66	7	4	2	bingham	The Leasehold Reform Act 1967 as amended gives to a qualifying tenant a statutory right to buy the freehold of the house of which he is the leaseholder .	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	1	0	0	0	0
3.32	66	8	5	2	bingham	The effect is that the owner , instead of recovering his property on the expiry of the lease in the ordinary way , receives a capital sum representing the value of the house at the date when the tenant gave notice of his wish to buy .	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.32	66	9	6	2	bingham	The calculation of that value is governed by a statutory formula clearly intended to yield a fair result as between tenant and owner , conferring no undue benefit on either .	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.32	66	10	7	2	bingham	Thus the value is based ( section 9 ( 1A ) ) on the amount which at the relevant time the house , if sold in the market by a willing seller , might be expected to realise on certain assumptions , among them ( section 9 ( 1A ) ( a ) ) that the vendor is selling for an estate in fee simple subject to the unexpired term of the existing tenancy .

3.32	66	13	10	3.5	bingham	This statutory language makes plain that the price will be diminished under this head if and only if it is found ( i ) that works of improvement ( meaning works other than renewals and repairs ) have been carried out by the tenant or his predecessors in title , ( ii ) that the tenant or his predecessors in title have carried out these works at their own expense , and ( iii ) that these works have increased the value of the house .

3.32	66	14	11	3.5	bingham	To the extent of the increase attributable to those works the price payable for the house is diminished .	BACKGROUND	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0

3.32	66	16	13	3.5	bingham	It would not be fair if the tenant were obliged to pay an enhanced price to the extent that such enhancement was attributable to works done by him or his predecessors in title ( probably voluntarily ) at their own expense : the tenant would in effect be paying twice .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.32	66	17	14	3.5	bingham	It would not be fair if the owner received a price inflated as a result of works done by the tenant or his predecessors in title ( probably voluntarily ) at their own expense : the owner would be reaping an adventitious gain as a result of works which he had had no right to require .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.32	66	18	15	3.5	bingham	Thus in each case where this assumption is in issue the question must be asked : has the value of this house been increased by any improvement carried out by the tenant or his predecessors in title at their own expense ?	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.32	66	19	16	3.5	bingham	If the answer to this question is yes , the market price must be reduced so as to discount the increase attributable to that improvement ( or improvements , if there are more than one ) .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.32	66	21	17	4	bingham	It has been common ground between the parties to this appeal that when this question is asked with reference to the extra storey and mansard roof built in the 1920s , the answer is yes , and they are agreed on the extent to which the price should be reduced on account of those works .

3.32	66	22	18	4	bingham	The controversy has centred on the works , admittedly done by the appellant ( Mr Shalson ) and his predecessors in title , and admittedly done at their own expense , to reconvert the house from five flats to a single dwelling as it was when originally let .	FRAMING	2	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.32	66	24	19	5	bingham	It seems to me plain that these works were improvements within the statutory language , since they were not works of repair and renewal and the statutory language makes plain that whether such works cause an increase of value raises a separate question ; it is not a defining characteristic of an improvement that it has the effect of increasing the value of the house .	FRAMING	1	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.32	66	25	20	5	bingham	In the present case it is common ground that the improvements in question ( the reconversion works ) increased the value of the house as compared with its value had those works not been done .	FRAMING	1	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.32	66	26	21	5	bingham	Thus the question posed in paragraph 3 must be answered yes , and there is agreement on the extent to which the price must be diminished on that basis .	DISPOSAL	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.32	66	28	22	6	bingham	The Leasehold Valuation Tribunal and the Lands Tribunal held that the reconversion works did not entitle the appellant to pay a diminished price because their effect was to reverse the conversion works carried out in the 1940s and return the house to its original configuration .

3.32	66	31	25	6	bingham	It seems very questionable whether they were improvements carried out by the appellant 's predecessor in title at his own expense , since the 1947 tenant was contractually bound to carry out the works and it seems likely ( although there is no finding on this ) that the rent payable under the lease was abated to reflect the expense to which he was committing himself .

3.32	66	32	26	6	bingham	But even if it were accepted that the conversion works were improvements carried out by the appellant 's predecessor in title at his own expense , it is quite plain that they did not ( as of the valuation date , which is the only date that matters ) increase the value of the house .	DISPOSAL	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.32	66	33	27	6	bingham	The effect of the reconversion works voluntarily undertaken by the appellant and his predecessors in title was to undo the conversion works and so render them wholly irrelevant for purposes of the statutory calculation , as having no effect on the market value of the house .

3.32	66	243	202	41	millett	If a former tenant had increased the value of the house by adding a conservatory , and the enfranchising tenant increased the value of the house still further by demolishing the conservatory and erecting a home extension in its place , he would be entitled to a reduction in price which reflected the combined effect of both improvements .

3.32	66	244	203	41	millett	His own improvement would consist of works of demolition and reconstruction ; but it would not be fair to reduce the price by an amount which reflected only the difference between the value of the house with a conservatory and the house with the benefit of the home extension .

3.32	66	245	204	41	millett	Had he not demolished the conservatory and built the home extension , he would still have been entitled to a diminution in the price to reflect the increase in the value of the house brought about by the construction of the conservatory .

3.32	66	247	205	42	millett	This , of course , presupposes that the earlier work also increased the value of the property and did not reduce it .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0

3.32	66	249	207	42	millett	The landlord gets the worst of both worlds ; he receives a lower price if the tenant carries out alterations which reduce the value of the property , and does not receive the benefit if the tenant carries out alterations which increase it .

3.32	66	257	214	43	millett	The landlord can avoid this result by taking a covenant in the lease that the tenant should obtain his prior consent to any works of improvement , and either refusing his consent or imposing a condition that the tenant restore the property to its former state at the termination of the tenancy .

3.32	66	258	215	43	millett	Even if the works of restoration should still fall to be treated as being carried out at the tenant 's expense , as to which I prefer to express no opinion , the obligation would severely limit and perhaps eliminate any effect the works would have on the value of the landlord 's reversionary interest .
