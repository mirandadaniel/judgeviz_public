1.42	2	243	219	40	hoffmann	It may be , as the Court of Appeal suggested , that a regulatory system in which a pay-TV broadcaster has to offer to share the rights with a public broadcaster means that any event which the latter wishes to broadcast will be unattractive to the pay-TV broadcaster and that the value of the rights will be depressed .

1.42	2	244	220	40	hoffmann	But that is a consequence which inevitably follows from the protection which the Directive was intended to confer upon the public right of access to such events .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0

1.42	2	246	222	41	hoffmann	The decision as to whether article 3a ( 3 ) requires that a UK broadcaster should not be allowed to exercise exclusive rights to broadcast an event designated by another member state is , by virtue of section 101B , a matter for the ITC .

1.42	2	247	223	41	hoffmann	It is not bound by the decision which the regulator in the other member state would have made .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.42	2	248	224	41	hoffmann	"The words "" as determined by that other member state in accordance with paragraph 1 "" at the end of article 3a ( 3 ) refer only to the matters which paragraph 1 says are for the determination of the member state , namely designated events and the question of whether the events should be available via whole or partial live coverage or whole or partial deferred coverage ."	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	0	0	0	0	0
1.42	2	250	225	42	hoffmann	The ITC 's view was that it would accept the Danish law on these matters and also on the question of what amounted to a substantial proportion of the public .	FACT	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.42	2	251	226	42	hoffmann	Otherwise the decision was a matter for them .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.42	2	252	227	42	hoffmann	That seems to me correct .	DISPOSAL	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.42	2	254	228	43	hoffmann	The ITC also rejected the suggestion of the Danish Ministry of Culture in a letter of 20 July 2000 that it should have no regard to the terms upon which TVD had acquired its rights .	FACT	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0

1.42	2	256	230	43	hoffmann	"It is true that article 3a ( 3 ) speaks of exclusive rights "" purchased ... following the date of publication of this Directive "" by the broadcasters and it was suggested that the article only operates once the rights have been purchased ."	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	0	0	0	0	0
1.42	2	257	231	43	hoffmann	Of course they have to be purchased in order to be exercised .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.42	2	258	232	43	hoffmann	"But that does not mean that the circumstances in which they were purchased are irrelevant to whether they are being exercised "" in such a way "" as to deprive the public of the possibility of watching the event ."	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.42	2	260	233	44	hoffmann	On the other hand , the ITC obviously paid considerable regard to the fact that under the Danish system of regulation , a non-qualifying broadcaster is required to offer to share the rights with public broadcasters who can offer sufficient coverage .	FACT	7	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.42	2	261	234	44	hoffmann	Again , this seems to me to be right .	DISPOSAL	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.42	2	262	235	44	hoffmann	The system of reciprocal enforcement created by article 3a requires that regulation should as far as possible be harmonised , so that the rights of the public to watch an event of national importance in a member state should not be affected by whether the broadcaster is in that or another member state .	FRAMING	8	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	0	0	0	0	0
1.42	2	263	236	44	hoffmann	"I say "" as far as possible "" because the ITC also has to have regard to the interests of UK broadcasters ."	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.42	2	264	237	44	hoffmann	But the regulatory system of each member state has to be approved by the Commission under article 3a ( 2 ) and one would therefore not expect its application to be an unreasonable restriction on the rights of broadcasters in other member states .

1.42	2	266	238	45	hoffmann	Any broadcaster in any member state who is considering the purchase of exclusive rights to broadcast in Denmark an event designated under Danish law must , as it seems to me , take into account the Danish system of regulation .	DISPOSAL	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.42	2	267	239	45	hoffmann	That system of regulation will influence the market for such rights in Denmark and prima facie it seems to me right that broadcasters in other member states should have to play by the same rules .	DISPOSAL	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.42	2	268	240	45	hoffmann	That was in my opinion the object which article 3a ( 3 ) was intended to achieve .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	0	0	0	0	0
1.42	2	269	241	45	hoffmann	The ITC and Mr Jack Beatson QC correctly interpreted it in that way .	DISPOSAL	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.42	2	270	242	45	hoffmann	In addition , the ITC is entitled to consider that the foreign regulator or arbitral body , such as the Danish Competition Council , acquainted as it is with its national market in television rights , will be best placed to form a view on whether its public broadcasters have refused a reasonable offer at a reasonable price .
