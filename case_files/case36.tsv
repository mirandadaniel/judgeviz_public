2.29	36	7	4	1	slynn	His analysis of the case law and the principles involved to my mind makes two things in particular abundantly clear .	TEXTUAL	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
2.29	36	8	5	1	slynn	The first is that the jurisdiction recognised in Norwich Pharmacal Co v Customs and Excise Commissioners [ 1974 ] AC 133 to order disclosure of , inter alia , the identity of a source of information or documents does not depend on whether the person against whom the order is sought has committed a tort , a breach of contract or other civil or criminal wrong .	DISPOSAL	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	1	1	0
2.29	36	9	6	1	slynn	"It is sufficient but , it is important to stress , also necessary that that person should be shown to have "" participated "" or been "" involved "" in the wrongdoing which is at the basis of the application for discovery ."	DISPOSAL	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
2.29	36	11	7	2	slynn	This latter requirement together with the residual discretion of the court as to whether it is right that an order should be made in all the circumstances provide a safeguard against an unjustified order for discovery .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
2.29	36	12	8	2	slynn	No one can or should forget the importance of the freedom of the press but it is plain as article 10 of the European Convention for the protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ( 1953 ) and section 10 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 require , that there are restrictions which are to be accepted as necessary in a democratic society .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	1	1	0	0	0	0
2.29	36	14	9	3	slynn	The second point is that it is not a necessary precondition of the exercise of the jurisdiction that the applicant should have begun , or had an intention to begin , legal proceedings inrespectof the allegedly wrongful act - in cases like these against the source .	DISPOSAL	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
2.29	36	15	10	3	slynn	My noble and learned friend 's reference to the speeches in British Steel Corp v Granada Television Ltd [ 1981 ] AC 1096 and in particular to the judgments of Lord Denning MR , at p 1127 , and of Templeman LJ , at p 1132 , in the Court of Appeal seems to me to establish this point conclusively despite the very well argued submissions of Mr Browne QC to the contrary .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	1	1	1	1
2.29	36	17	11	4	slynn	As to whether in this case the order was justified , I have no doubt that there was a sufficient and proportionate justification .	DISPOSAL	1	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
2.29	36	18	12	4	slynn	The fact that Mr Brady may have initiated or consented to some publication of his medical records cannot possibly deprive the hospital of the protection which they patently need .	DISPOSAL	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0

2.29	36	73	58	17	woolf	It is part of the agreed facts that leaks to the press have a detrimental effect on security ; treatment of patients and staff morale , because they may inhibit proper recording of information about patients ; may deter patients from providing information about themselves ; may damage the patient-doctor relationship , which rests on trust ; may lead to assaults by patients on a patient about whom information is disclosed ; may create an atmosphere of distrust amongst staff , which is detrimental to efficient and co-operative work ; and give rise to fear of future ( and potentially more damaging ) leaks .
