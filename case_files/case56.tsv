3.31	56	7	4	2	bingham	For reasons given by the House in the Soci~~#233;t~~#233; Eram case [ 2003 ] UKHL 30 I think it clear that the English court had no jurisdiction to make a garnishee order absolute in this case .	DISPOSAL	1	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	1	0

3.31	56	10	6	3	bingham	This case , however , differs from Soci~~#233;t~~#233; Eram in one significant respect : that the United Kingdom is a party to the Lugano Convention , incorporated into English law by section 3A of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 as amended , and Switzerland ( where the chose in action which the judgment creditors seek to attach is situated ) is also a party .
