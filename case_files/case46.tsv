3.02	46	359	420	41	hutton	Although I am unable to agree with Andrew Smith J that no preparatory hearings had begun against the respondent and against the other nine defendants , I am in agreement with him that the custody time limits are an important safeguard for accused persons and that prosecutors and judges should consider with care whether prolonged detention before trial is properly justified .

3.02	46	361	422	41	hutton	On this aspect of the case I would wish to make two observations .	TEXTUAL	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.02	46	362	423	41	hutton	The first observation is that where a preparatory hearing takes place before the custody time limit expires so that a defendant loses the right to bail which he would have enjoyed if the time limit had expired before there had been a preparatory hearing , he is still entitled to apply for bail to the Crown Court , and the period which would elapse before the case came to trial is a factor which the judge hearing the application would have to take into account .

3.02	46	363	424	41	hutton	This is a point to which the Crown Court judge referred in his comments at page 7 of the transcript of the hearing on 5 October 2001 which is set out in paragraph 11 of this opinion .	PROCEEDINGS	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	1	0	0	0
3.02	46	364	425	41	hutton	But it appears that in this case no application for bail on behalf of the respondent was made to the Crown Court after the preparatory hearing on 5 October 2001 .	PROCEEDINGS	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	1	0	0	0
3.02	46	366	426	42	hutton	Secondly , I think that there may be some cases involving a large number of defendants or complex issues where , in the particular circumstances of the case , it may be appropriate for the judge to conduct a preparatory hearing , which has the effect of terminating the custody time limit , notwithstanding that a trial cannot be held in the near future .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
3.02	46	367	427	42	hutton	In such a case , where a defendant remains in custody and an application is made to the Crown Court for bail , it will be for the judge , weighing all the circumstances , including the period for which the defendant will remain in custody before trial if he were not granted bail , to decide whether or not bail should be granted .

3.02	46	371	432	42.5	hutton	Therefore I do not think it is appropriate to state as an inflexible rule that a judge should not start a preparatory hearing until he is certain that he is in a position to proceed with the hearing itself expeditiously .	DISPOSAL	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
