1.63	23	19	13	4	hutton	It is a general rule in the construction of deeds that the intention of the parties is to be ascertained from the words used in the deed and that , with certain limited exceptions , extrinsic evidence cannot be given to show the real intention of the parties .

1.63	23	23	17	5	hutton	However , whilst in the present case it would not have been permissible in construing the mortgage deed to take into account extrinsic evidence of the intention of the parties , I note with some satisfaction that it is apparent that the construction given to the mortgage by Lord Scott and Lord Rodger does not defeat the real intention of the parties .

1.63	23	265	246	49.5	rodger	It is common ground that this provision can indeed be construed as imposing an obligation on Mr Gold , jointly with Mr Martin but also severally , to pay not only all sums of money advanced by the bank to Mr Martin and Mr Gold but also all sums advanced by the bank to either of them as an individual .
