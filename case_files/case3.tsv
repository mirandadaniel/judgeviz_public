1.38	3	176	156	25	hoffmann	The test is quantitative in the sense that , as there can be infringement only by making a facsimile copy , the question will always be whether one has made a facsimile copy of enough of the published edition to amount to a substantial part .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
1.38	3	177	157	25	hoffmann	But the question of what counts as enough seems to me to be qualitative , depending not upon the proportion which the part taken bears to the whole but on whether the copy can be said to have appropriated the presentation and lay out of the edition .

1.38	3	181	160	26	hoffmann	"The answer is a "" published edition "" which consists of a single article on an otherwise blank sheet has a strikingly different typographical arrangement from a "" published edition "" which consists of a newspaper ( or even a page of a newspaper ) including the same article in the same type but juxtaposed with other articles on the page ."
