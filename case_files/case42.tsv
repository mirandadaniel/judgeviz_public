2.13	42	28	21	4	hobhouse	The appellants had a contractual right to require the respondents to sell the goods at the end of the ' primary ' contract period but the appellants could only act as the negotiating agent of the respondents in relation to the sale and the sale must be at a price approved by the respondents prior to the sale .

2.13	42	31	24	4	hobhouse	There were also default provisions of a familiar kind which gave the respondents the right to bring the agreements to an end at any stage if the appellants failed to perform their obligations .	FACT	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0

2.13	42	33	26	4	hobhouse	The purpose of claiming relief was so that the appellants could take advantage of the provisions for the sale of the goods and enjoy the benefit of the rebate .	PROCEEDINGS	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
2.13	42	35	27	5	hobhouse	There is now no dispute that the agreements were of a character susceptible to relief against forfeiture ; they were financing agreements and possession of the goods was given to the debtor .	PROCEEDINGS	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0
2.13	42	36	28	5	hobhouse	( Shiloh Spinners Ltd v Harding [ 1973 ] AC 691 ) Similarly it is not in dispute that the appellants needed to obtain an order for such relief if they were to be enabled to exercise their contractual right to require the sale of the goods and obtain the 95% rebate .

2.13	42	37	29	5	hobhouse	The complication which has given rise to these appeals is that , when the appellants ' business collapsed , the receivers wanted to mitigate their loss by selling the business as a going concern which meant , in commercial terms , that they must find a way of procuring the sale of both the appellants ' goodwill and the respondents ' computer systems together to the same purchaser .

2.13	42	249	210	44	scott	It was accepted both at first instance and in the Court of Appeal that immediately before the sale of the video and editing equipment pursuant to the order of Harman J on 5 March 1998 , or perhaps immediately before the order was made , the court had jurisdiction to grant the appellants relief from the forfeiture of the finance leases that had been brought about by the entry of the appellants into administrative receivership .

2.13	42	251	212	44	scott	It was accepted before your Lordships by Sir Roy Goode QC , counsel for the respondents , that if there had been no sale the appellants would have succeeded in obtaining relief from forfeiture on terms that would have included the payment of all arrears of rentals .

2.13	42	252	213	44	scott	Sir Murray Stuart-Smith was , therefore , right in identifying the question whether the sale of the equipment pursuant to the court 's order defeated the appellants ' claim to relief from forfeiture as the critical question .	FRAMING	NONE	NONE	NONE	NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0

2.13	42	258	217	46	scott	The effect of an interim order for sale , whether made under Order 29 , rule 4 or , now , under CPR 25.1 ( c ) ( v ) , is that once the sale pursuant to the order has taken place the proceeds of sale stand in the place of the property sold for the purpose of giving effect , so far as practicable , to the rights claimed by the parties to the litigation in the property sold .

2.13	42	260	218	47	scott	In the present case the rights claimed by the appellants in the equipment were the right to relief from forfeiture and , subject to relief being granted , the right to possess and use the equipment in specie and the right to take 95 % of the net proceeds of a sale of the equipment under clause 12 .

2.13	42	270	225	50	scott	In these circumstances , and the court being satisfied that an order for relief from forfeiture would have been made if there had been no sale pursuant to Harman J 's order , the respective rights that the appellants and the respondents would have had in the proceeds of a clause 12 sale should be given effect to by treating the proceeds of the sale under Harman J 's order as the proceeds of a clause 12 sale .
